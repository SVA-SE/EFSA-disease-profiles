2) and a significant reduction in parasite load in the skin, results only showed in a graph
The values of the linear cycle (Treshold cycle-Ct), obtained from 10 to 100 ng of DNA from each sample were analyzed with reference to the standard curve obtained for parasite load. The curve for quantifying parasite load determined r2 = 0.98 and the reaction showed a slope of −3.286. Upon completion of treatment, parasite load had decreased in the P-MAPA treated group (p < 0.05, Fig. 2a) and showed a significant reduction compared with the placebo group (p < 0.05, Fig. 2a and 2b)",,
