The alphacypermethrin-treated HDPE mesh applied to the stall significantly (P = 0.008) reduced the number of Culicoides midges, predominantly Culicoides (Avaritia) imicola Kieffer, mechanically aspirated from horses housed in the stall. The mesh reduced the Culicoides midge attack rate in the treated stall compared to the untreated stall and a sentinel horse by 6 times and 14 times, respectively. The number of Culicoides midges and C imicola collected in light traps from the untreated and alphacypermethrin HDPE mesh-treated stalls did not differ significantly (P = 0.82). Alphacypermethrin-treated HDPE mesh could be used to reduce exposure of horses in jet stalls to Culicoides midges, specifically C. imicola, and the risk of midge-borne Orbivirus transmission.

(Family: Fabaceae) against Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles stephensi (Diptera: Culicidae)","Several diseases are associated to the mosquito-human interaction. Mosquitoes are the carriers of severe and well-known illnesses such as malaria, arboviral encephalitis, dengue fever, chikungunya fever, West Nile virus, and yellow fever. These diseases produce significant morbidity and mortality in humans and livestock around the world. In the present study, hexane, benzene, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol extracts of leaf and seed of Albizia lebbeck were assayed for their toxicity against three important vector mosquitoes, viz., Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Anopheles stephensi. The mean percent hatchability of the eggs was observed after 48 h post-treatment. The percent hatchability was inversely proportional to the concentration of extract and directly proportional to the eggs. All the five solvent extracts showed moderate ovicidal activity; however, the methanol extract showed the highest ovicidal activity. One hundred percent mortality was observed at 250, 200, and 150 ppm for leaf methanol extract and 375, 300, and 225 ppm for seed methanol extract of A. lebbeck against C. quinquefasciatus, Ae. aegypti, and An. stephensi, respectively. The adulticidal activity of plant leaf and seed extracts showed moderate toxic effect on the adult mosquitoes after 24 h of exposure period. However, the highest adulticidal activity was observed in the leaf methanol extract of A. lebbeck against An. stephensi where the LC50 and LC90 values were 65.12 and 117.70 ppm, respectively. Compared to leaf extracts, seeds have low potency against three mosquito species. No mortality was recorded in the control. Our data suggest that the crude hexane, benzene, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and methanol solvent extracts of A. lebbeck have the potential to be used as an eco-friendly approach for the control of the An. stephensi, Ae. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus. These results suggest that the leaf and seed extracts have the potential to be used as an ideal eco-friendly approach for the control of mosquitoes.",2015,tobias.lilja,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

In 'treatment temperature experiment', the effect of temperature was observed for 24 hours following an hour exposure of C. nubeculosis to varying concentrations of deltamethrin while in '24 hours post treatment temperature experiment', effect of temperature was observed for 24 hours of 1 hour exposure of C. nubeculosis to test insecticide. Subsequent experiments with C. nubeculosis that survived after 24 hours post-exposure to sub-lethal doses of deltamethrin as well as control group were used to evaluate blood-feeding and egg production rates. Results indicated significant effects on mortality of biting midges in post treatment temperature experiment but insignificant in treatment temperature experiments. The difference in blood feeding rates between deltamethrin-exposed biting midges and the control group was statistically insignificant (P>.05) but eggs laid by control group were significantly more in number than those lay by exposed (P<.05).

While currently restricted in distribution to sub-Saharan Africa, AHSV has a history of emergence into southern Europe and causes one of the most lethal diseases of horses and other species of Equidae. In the event of an outbreak of AHSV, the use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) to screen equine accommodation is recommended by competent authorities including the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) in order to reduce vector-host contact. Methods: Seven commercially available pyrethroid insecticides and three repellent compounds, all of which are licensed for amateur use, were assessed in modified World Health Organization (WHO) cone bioassay trials in the laboratory using a colony line of Culicoides nubeculosus (Meigen), 1830. Two field trials were subsequently conducted to test the efficiency of treated net screens in preventing entry of Culicoides. Results: A formulation of cypermethrin (0.15% w/w) and pyrethrins (0.2% w/w) (Tri-Tec 14, LS Sales (Farnham) Ltd, Bloxham, UK) applied to black polyvinyl-coated polyester insect screen (1.6 mm aperture; 1.6 mm thickness) inflicted 100% mortality on batches of C. nubeculosus following a three minute exposure in the WHO cone bioassays at 1, 7 and 14 days post-treatment. Tri-Tec 14 outperformed all other treatments tested and was subsequently selected for use in field trials. The first trial demonstrated that treated screens placed around an ultraviolet light-suction trap entirely prevented Culicoides being collected, despite their collection in identical traps with untreated screening or no screening. The second field trial examined entry of Culicoides into stables containing horses and found that while the insecticide treated screens reduced entry substantially, there was still a small risk of exposure to biting. Conclusions: Screened stables can be utilised as part of an integrated control program in the event of an AHSV outbreak in order to reduce vector-host contact and may also be applicable to protection of horses from Culicoides during transport.",2015,tobias.lilja,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","Horse (Equus ferus caballus)"

The continuous application of synthetic insecticides causes development of resistance in vector species, biological magnification of toxic substances through the food chain, and adverse effects on environmental quality and nontarget organisms including human health. Application of active toxic agents from plant extracts as an alternative mosquito control strategy was available from ancient times. These are nontoxic, easily available at affordable prices, biodegradable, and show broad-spectrum target-specific activities against different species of vector mosquitoes. In the present study, the larvicidal activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using Sida acuta plant leaf extract against late third instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi, and Aedes aegypti was determined. Range of concentrations of synthesized AgNPs (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mu g/mL) and aqueous leaf extract (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mu g/mL) were tested against the larvae of C. quinquefasciatus, A. stephensi and A. aegypti. The synthesized AgNPs from S. acuta leaf were highly toxic than crude leaf aqueous extract in three important vector mosquito species. The results were recorded from UV-Vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis. Larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of aqueous crude extract and synthesized AgNPs for 24 h. Considerable mortality was evident after the treatment of S. acuta for all three important vector mosquitoes. The LC50 and LC90 values of S. acuta aqueous leaf extract appeared to be most effective against A. stephensi (LC50, 109.94 mu g/mL and LC90, 202.42 mu g/mL) followed by A. aegypti LC50 (119.32 mu g/mL and LC90, 213.84 mu g/mL) and C. quinquefasciatus (LC50, 130.30 mu g/mL and LC90, 228.20 mu g/mL). Synthesized AgNPs against the vector mosquitoes of A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus had the following LC50 and LC90 values: A. stephensi had LC50 and LC90 values of 21.92, and 41.07 mu g/mL; A. aegypti had LC50 and LC90 values of 23.96, and 44.05 mu g/mL; C. quinquefasciatus had LC50 and LC90 values of 26.13 and 47.52 mu g/mL. These results suggest that the use of S. acuta synthesized silver nanoparticles can be a rapid, environmentally safer biopesticide which can form a novel approach to develop effective biocides for controlling the target vector mosquitoes.

A range of tick-borne pathogens, including diverse species of bacteria and protozoa, can infect both dogs and humans. Hence, the control of tick infestations is pivotal to decrease or prevent tick-borne pathogen transmission. Therefore, different commercial products with insecticidal, repellent or both properties have been developed for use on dogs. Recently, a collar containing a combination of imidacloprid 10% and flumethrin 4.5% has proven effective to prevent tick and flea infestations in dogs under field conditions and the infection by some vector-borne pathogens they transmit under laboratory-controlled conditions. Methods: From March 2011 to April 2012, a field study was conducted in a private shelter in southern Italy to assess the efficacy of the imidacloprid/flumethrin collar against tick and flea infestations and to determine if this strategy would decrease tick-borne pathogen transmission in young dogs. A total of 122 animals were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to group A (n = 64; collared) or group B (n = 58; untreated controls). Dogs were examined monthly for ticks and fleas and systematically tested for selected tick-borne pathogens. Results: Compared to controls, the collar provided overall efficacies of 99.7% and 100% against tick and flea infestation, respectively.

Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, the major vectors of dengue, were recently shown to undergo pre-imaginal development in brackish water bodies in the island. A limited survey of selected coastal localities of the Jaffna district in northern Sri Lanka was carried out to identify mosquito species undergoing pre-imaginal development in brackish and saline waters. The effect of salinity on the toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis larvicide to Ae. aegypti larvae at salinity levels naturally tolerated by Ae. aegypti was examined. Methods: Larvae collected at the selected sites along the Jaffna coast were identified and salinity of habitat water determined in the laboratory. The LC 50 and LC 90 of B. thuringiensis toxin, the active ingredient of a commercial formulation of the larvicide BACTIVEC(R), were determined with Ae. aegypti larvae. Bioassays were also carried out at salinities varying from 0 to18 ppt to determine the toxicity of Bacillus thuringiensis to fresh and brackish water-derived larvae of Ae. aegypti. Results: Larvae of four Anopheles, two Aedes, one Culex and one Lutzia species were collected from brackish and saline sites with salinity in the range 2 to 68 ppt. The LC 50 and LC 90 of B. thuringiensis toxin for the second instar larvae of Ae. aegypti in fresh water were 0.006 ppm and 0.013 ppm respectively, with corresponding values for brackish water populations of 0.008 and 0.012 ppm respectively. One hundred percent survival of second instar fresh water and brackish water-derived Ae. aegypti larvae was recorded at salinity up to 10 and 12 ppt and 100% mortality at 16 and 18 ppt, yielding an LC 50 for salinity of 13.9 ppt and 15.4 ppt at 24 h post-treatment respectively for the two populations. Statistical analysis showed significantly reduced toxicity of B. thuringiensis to fresh and brackish water-derived Ae. aegypti larvae at high salinities. Conclusion: A variety of mosquito vectors of human diseases undergo pre-imaginal development in brackish or saline waters in coastal areas of the Jaffna district in northern Sri Lanka. Salinity has a small but significant negative impact on the toxicity of B. thuringiensis toxin to Ae. aegypti larvae at salinity levels where Ae. aegypti larvae are found in the environment. This has implications for the use of B. thuringiensis toxin as a larvicide in brackish waters.",2012,thomas.rosendal,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

The aims of this study were to determine: (1) which Culicoides spp. are associated with sheep in The Netherlands; (2) the time of the day when they are most active; and (3) the effect of treatment of animals with a permethrin insecticide. Two pairs of sheep were each housed within mosquito tents of either one or two layers of netting and all trapped Culicoides spp. were identified microscopically. For the permethrin insecticide study, one of two pairs of sheep was treated with 3.6% permethrin and all animals were housed in tents of similar design. Of the 6210 midges captured, 54.1% were identified as C. chiopterus and 42.7% as C. obsoletus. C imicola was not identified. The average insect feeding rate was 35-40% and midge activity was greatest around sunset. Permethrin treatment reduced the number of midges captured by 50% and also resulted in a decrease in the percentage of midges that had fed. The findings provide useful information on the behaviour and distribution of Culicoides spp. that will facilitate the development of appropriate control strategies to minimise the risk of insect-vector borne virus diseases such as bluetongue.

During dengue epidemics, adult Aedes aegypti control with pyrethroid space sprays is implemented in order to rapidly reduce transmission. Unfortunately, vector control programs are facing operational challenges with the emergence of pyrethroid resistant Ae. aegypti populations. Methodology/Principal Findings: To assess the impact of pyrethroid resistance on the efficacy of treatments, applications of deltamethrin and natural pyrethrins were performed with vehicle-mounted thermal foggers in 9 localities of Martinique, where Ae. aegypti populations are strongly resistant to pyrethroids. Efficacy was assessed by monitoring mortality rates of naturally resistant and laboratory susceptible mosquitoes placed in sentinel cages. Before, during and after spraying, larval and adult densities were estimated. Results showed high mortality rates of susceptible sentinel mosquitoes treated with deltamethrin while resistant mosquitoes exhibited very low mortality. There was no reduction of either larval or adult Ae. aegypti population densities after treatments. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first documented evidence that pyrethroid resistance impedes dengue vector control using pyrethroid-based treatments.

Following successful use of the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae against larval stages of biting midge Culicoides nubeculosus Meigen, we investigated the efficacy of this strain and other fungi (Beauveria bassiana, Isaria fumosorosea and Lecanicillium longisporum) as biocontrol agents against adult C. nubeculosus in laboratory and greenhouse studies. Methodology/Findings: Exposure of midges to 'dry' conidia of all fungal isolates caused significant reductions in survival compared to untreated controls. Metarhizium anisopliae strain V275 was the most virulent, causing a significantly decrease in midge survival compared to all other fungal strains tested. The LT(50) value for strain V275 was 1.42 days compared to 2.21-3.22 days for the other isolates. The virulence of this strain was then further evaluated by exposing C. nubeculosus to varying doses (10(8)-10(11) conidia m(-2)) using different substrates (horse manure, damp peat, leaf litter) as a resting site. All exposed adults were found to be infected with the strain V275 four days after exposure. A further study exposed C. nubeculosus adults to 'dry' conidia and 'wet' conidia (conidia suspended in 0.03% aq. Tween 80) of strain V275 applied to damp peat and leaf litter in cages within a greenhouse. 'Dry' conidia were more effective than 'wet' conidia, causing 100% mortality after 5 days. Conclusion/Significance: This is the first study to demonstrate that entomopathogenic fungi are potential biocontrol agents against adult Culicoides, through the application of 'dry' conidia on surfaces (e. g., manure, leaf litter, livestock) where the midges tend to rest. Subsequent conidial transmission between males and females may cause an increased level of fungi-induced mortality in midges thus reducing the incidence of disease.",2011,ann.lindberg,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

Ae. albopictus bioassay results showed significant residual efficacy for both insecticides up to 6 wk posttreatment. There were no significant differences between properties treated with the two insecticides. In contrast, Culex spp. were not reduced by either insecticidal treatment.

The dogs used in this trial were laboratory-bred beagles: eight were impregnated with the solution (treated group), while the other eight were left untreated (control group). On day 0 the animals in the treatment group received 0.1 ml/kg body weight of the combination imidacloprid/permethrin spot-on. Dogs were exposed for I h to about 100 female sand flies at weekly intervals for a period of 4 weeks, on day 1, 7, 14, 2 1, and 28 after applying the product. The repellency criterion was based on the feeding rate of sand flies in the treated compared to the untreated group. The insecticidal efficacy criterion was based on comparison of the survival rate of sand flies between the two groups. The product had an insecticidal efficacy on female sand flies of 53.2% (day 1), 49.4% (day 7), 15.1% (day 14) 13.2% (day 22), and 2.9% (day 29).

Within the first week of application the insecticidal effect was significant; however it did not surpass 50%. On the other hand, the product showed a potent anti-feeding effect of over 90% during the first 3 weeks of this trial.

Collared dogs were kept separately (two untreated control dogs lived together) in outdoor enclosures, each with a kennel, in the Cevennes, southern France. To measure sandfly mortality and anti-feeding effects due to the deltamethrin-impregnated collars worn continuously by the dogs for up to 8 months? each dog was periodically sedated and exposed for 2h to 150-200 laboratory-reared Phlebotomus perniciosus females (plus c. 25 males) inside a net (1.2m square, 1.8m high) indoors. After dogs were removed from the nets, allowed to recover and returned to their kennels, any dead sandflies were collected from inside the net and counted. Surviving flies were kept overnight, then scored according to whether they were still alive or dead, unfed or blood-fed. From tests 2, 3, 4, 13, 20, 26 and 34 weeks after the dogs began wearing collars, the overall numbers of blood-fed female sandflies recaptured were 75 from two dogs with collars, compared with 1911 from two collarless dogs. Thus, for every 100 flies which fed on collarless dogs, only 4 fed on collared dogs, i.e. the collars protected dogs from 96% of the bites and this activity was maintained for up to 34 weeks. During the same period, the percentage of recaptured female sandflies that had fed on collared dogs was 0-12% compared to 55-95% on collarless dogs. Immediately after dogs were taken out of the nets, 21-60% of flies confined with the collared dogs were found dead, compared to 0-12% with the controls. It is concluded that, at least in the Mediterranean subregion, this insecticidal collar would protect a dog from the majority of sandfly bites and retain a killing effect for a complete sandfly season. Moreover, it seems likely that the use of collars on all dogs in a focus of Leishmania infantum would reduce contact between sandfly vectors and canine reservoir hosts sufficiently to diminish the risk of infection for humans as well as dogs.",1997,ann.lindberg,4,"Leishmania infantum","Dog (Canis lupus familiaris)"

The speed of kill of a parasiticide is critical to minimize the direct and deleterious effects of tick infestation and especially to reduce the risk of tick-borne pathogen transmission. In this study, speed of kill of a novel orally administered isoxazoline parasiticide, sarolaner chewable tablets (Simparica (TM)), against I. scapularis on dogs was evaluated and compared with afoxolaner (NexGard (R)) for five weeks after a single oral dose. Methods: Twenty four dogs were randomly allocated to treatment with either placebo, sarolaner (2 to 4 mg/kg), or afoxolaner (2.5 to 6.8 mg/kg) based on pretreatment tick counts. Dogs were examined and live ticks counted at 8, 12, and 24 h after treatment and subsequent re-infestations on Days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35. Efficacy was determined at each time point relative to counts for placebo dogs. Results: A single oral dose of sarolaner provided >99 % efficacy within 24 h of treatment and >95 % against subsequent weekly re-infestations of ticks consistently to Day 35. For the earlier time points, sarolaner significantly reduced tick counts versus placebo from Day 0 to Day 21 at 8 and 12 h, and on Day 35 at 12 h (P <= 0.0174), while afoxolaner was only significantly lower at 8 h on Days 0 and 14 (P <= 0.0309), and at 12 h on Day 0 only (P < 0.0001). Significantly more live ticks were recovered from a foxolaner-treated dogs than from sarolaner-treated dogs at 24 h after infestation from Day 14 to Day 35 (P <= 0.0278). At 24 h, efficacy (based on geometric mean counts) of afoxolaner declined to less than 80 % from Day 21 through the end of the study, while efficacy for sarolaner was >95 % for 35 days. There were no adverse reactions to treatments. Conclusions: In this controlled laboratory evaluation, sarolaner had a faster speed of kill against I. scapularis than afoxolaner. This was noticeably more pronounced towards the end of the monthly treatment period. The rapid and consistent kill of ticks provided by sarolaner within 24 h after a single oral dose and re-infestation over 35 days suggests this treatment will provide highly effective and reliable control of ticks over the entire treatment interval, and should reduce the risk of tick-borne diseases, including Lyme disease whose agent is vectored by I. scapularis.",2016,tobias.lilja,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","Dog (Canis lupus familiaris)"

Novel vector control tools are required which target such vector species, such as Anopheles arabiensis, that feed outdoors and have minimal contact with ITNs and IRS. Methods: To address this need, ivermectin, eprinomectin, and fipronil were evaluated in Zebu cattle under semi-field conditions to evaluate the potential of these compounds to reduce the survival of blood feeding An. arabiensis. Over the course of four experiments, lactating cattle received doses of oral ivermectin at 0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg, oral eprinomectin at 0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg, topical eprinomectin at 0.5, 0.75, or 1.5 mg/kg, or oral fipronil at 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg/kg. On days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 21 days post-treatment, cattle were exposed to An. arabiensis, and mosquito mortality post-blood feeding was monitored. For the analysis of survival data, the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Mantel-Haenszel test was used to contrast the treatment and control survival functions. Results: All three compounds significantly reduced the survival time of An. arabiensis. Twenty-one days post-treatment, mortality of mosquitoes fed on cattle dosed orally with 0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg eprinomectin, topically with eprinomectin at 0.5 mg/kg, or orally with either 1.0 or 1.5 mg/kg fipronil was still significantly higher than control mortality. Conclusions: These data demonstrate the effectiveness of three insecticidal compounds administered systemically to cattle for controlling the cattle-feeding mosquito An. arabiensis.

In Europe, Ixodes ricinus, the sheep tick, plays an important role as companion animal parasite but is also the primary vector of medically important diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme borreliosis. The present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy under laboratory conditions of a new fixed spot-on combination of fipronil and permethrin (Effitix (R), Virbac) in treating and preventing tick infestations of Ixodes ricinus in dogs. Methods: Twelve dogs were included in this randomized, controlled, blinded laboratory study. They were randomly allocated to two groups of six dogs each according to their pre-treatment live attached Ixodes ricinus tick count. On day 0, the dogs from Group 2 were treated with the recommended dose of Effitix (R), the dogs from Group 1 remained untreated. On days -2, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35, all dogs were infested with 50 (+/- 4) viable unfed adult Ixodes ricinus (20 +/- 2 males, 30 +/- 2 females). Ticks were removed and counted at 48 +/- 2 hours post product administration or tick infestations. Results: Through the study, the tick attachment rates for the untreated group were greater than 25% demonstrating that adequate levels of infestation were reached on the control dogs.

Vector resistance to insecticides has been extensively studied, however the insecticidal effects of the nets and sprayed walls on pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes has not been studied thoroughly. We evaluated the bioefficacy of LLINs of different ages and lambda-cyhalothrin (ICON 10cs) on the sprayed mud walls for a period of time on malaria vector survivorship. Methods: WHO tube bioassay was performed using diagnostic doses of lambda-cyhalothrin (0.05%), permethrin (0.75%) and deltamethrin (0.05%). Cone bioassays were conducted on netting materials from 0 to 3 years old long-lasting insecticide-impregnated nets. Wall bioassays were performed monthly on mud slabs sprayed with lambdacyhalothrin over a period of seven months. All bioassays used An. gambiae mosquitoes collected from the field and the laboratory susceptible reference Kisumu strain. Concentration of the insecticides on the netting materials was examined using the gas chromatography method. Mosquitoes were identified to species level using PCR and genotyped for the kdr gene mutation frequencies. Results: WHO bioassays results showed that populations from five sites were highly resistant to the pyrethroids (mortalities ranged from 52.5 to 75.3%), and two sites were moderately resistant to these insecticides (80.4-87.2%). Homozygote kdr mutations of L1014S ranged from 73 to 88% in An. gambiae s.s. dominant populations whereas L1014S mutation frequencies were relatively low (7-31%) in An. arabiensis dominant populations. There was a significant decrease ( P<0.05) in mosquito mortality with time after the spray with both lambda-cyhalothrin (75% mortality after six months) and with the age of LLINs (60% mortality after 24 month). Field collected mosquitoes were able to survive exposure to both IRS and LLINs even with newly sprayed walls (86.6-93.5% mortality) and new LLINs (77.5-85.0% mortality), Wild mosquitoes collected from the field had significantly lower mortality rates to LLINs (59.6-85.0%) than laboratory reared susceptible strain (100%). Insecticide concentration decreased significantly from 0.14 g/ml in the new nets to 0.077 g/ml in nets older than 18 months ( P<0.05). Conclusion: This study confirms that insecticide decay and developing levels of resistance have a negative contribution to reduced efficacy of ITN and IRS in western Kenya. These factors contribute to decreased efficacy of pyrethroid insecticides in ongoing malaria control programs. In order to mitigate against the impact of insecticide resistance and decay it is important to follow the WHO policy to provide the residents with new LLINs every three years of use while maintaining a high level of LLINs coverage and usage. There is also need for urgent development and deployment of non-pyrethroid based vector control tools.",2015,thomas.rosendal,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

Oxborough","Evaluating the sterilizing effect of pyriproxyfen treated mosquito nets against Anopheles gambiae at different blood-feeding intervals","Pyrethroid resistant malaria vectors are widespread throughout sub-Saharan Africa and new insecticides with different modes of action are urgently needed. Pyriproxyfen is a juvenile hormone mimic that reduces fecundity and fertility of adult Anopheles mosquitoes when used as a contact insecticide. A long-lasting insecticidal net incorporating pyriproxyfen is under development. As wild, host-seeking females may succeed in blood-feeding at different intervals after initial contact with mosquito nets the aim of this study was to determine the effect that age and gonotrophic status (nulliparous or parous) and the interval between initial pyriproxyfen exposure and blood-feeding has in terms of subsequent reduced fecundity and fertility. Anopheles gambiae s.s. were exposed to pyriproxyfen LLIN for three minutes in WHO cone bioassays. Four regimens were tested with different blood-feeding intervals A-1 hour (nulliparous), B-1 hour (parous), C-24 h (nulliparous), or D-120 h (nulliparous) after pyriproxyfen exposure. Mosquito oviposition rate, fecundity and fertility of eggs were recorded for several days. All four treatment regimens produced levels of mortality similar to unexposed females. The overall reduction in reproductive rate of 99.9% for regimen A relative to the untreated net was primarily due to oviposition inhibition in exposed females (97%). Pyriproxyfen was equally effective against older parous mosquitoes and when blood-feeding was 24 h after exposure. Regimen D produced a reduction in reproductive rate of 60.1% but this was of lesser magnitude than other regimens and was the only regimen that failed to reduce fertility of laid eggs, indicating the effects of pyriproxyfen exposure on reproduction are to some extent reversible as mosquitoes age. In an area of moderate to high mosquito net coverage a host-seeking mosquito is likely to contact a treated mosquito net before: (a) penetrating a holed net and blood-feeding shortly after exposure or, (b) be frustrated by intact nets before succeeding in blood-feeding on an unprotected individual the following night. Mosquito nets are an appropriate delivery system for pyriproxyfen, based on the large reductions in reproductive rate when blood-feeding between 1 h and 24 h after exposure. Combining with a pyrethroid should be an effective approach if susceptible mosquitoes are killed and resistant mosquitoes sterilized. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: In each study, 16 healthy adult dogs were allocated to two groups. Eight dogs were treated with the new topical spot-on combination of fipronil and permethrin on Day 0 and the other eight dogs served as untreated controls. Each dog was exposed to mosquitoes on Days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 (and also on Day 35 in the A. aegypti study). After a 1-h exposure period, all mosquitoes were counted and categorized as live or dead and fed or non-fed. Live mosquitoes were kept in an insectary and observed for mortality counts 4, 24 and 48 h post-exposure (PE) for Aedes spp. and 24 and 48 h PE for C. pipiens. Repellency and insecticidal efficacies were defined as the percent reduction in the number of fed and live mosquitoes, respectively, in the treated group as compared to the untreated control group. Results: Repellency against A. albopictus was >= 93.4% through Day 21 and 86.9% on Day 28. It was >= 91.0% through Day 35 against A. aegypti and >= 90.4% through Day 28 against C. pipiens. Insecticidal efficacy against A. albopictus was >= 97.1% at 24 h PE from Day 7 to Day 28. It was >= 98.0% for the first 3 weeks and still 75.7% on Day 35 against A. aegypti at 24 h PE. For C. pipiens, insecticidal efficacy ranged from 93.8% (Day 7) to 30.9% (Day 28) at 48 h PE. Conclusions: A single topical administration of the combination of fipronil and permethrin provides repellency against mosquitoes on dogs for at least 4 weeks. The product may therefore significantly reduce the potential for the transmission of vector-borne pathogens through the inhibition of mosquito feeding, as well as the discomfort associated with mosquito bites. Moreover, mosquito mortality was induced by contact with the treated dogs, which could aid in the control of mosquitoes, and hence the control of mosquito-borne diseases, in the local vicinity of treated dogs.",2015,ann.lindberg,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","Dog (Canis lupus familiaris)"

However, there is limited data on common types of wall surfaces sprayed in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania where IRS began in 2006 and 2007 respectively. The study investigated residual efficacy of micro-encapsulated lambda-cyhalothrin sprayed on common surfaces of human dwellings and domestic animal shelters in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. Methods: An experimental hut was constructed with different types of materials simulating common sprayable surfaces in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. Surfaces included cement plastered wall, mud-daub, white-wash, wood, palm-thatch, galvanized iron-sheets, burnt-bricks, limestone and oil-paint. The World Health Organization (WHO) procedure for IRS was used to spray lambda-cyhalothrin on surfaces at the dose of 20-25 mg/m(2). Residual efficacy of insecticide was monitored through cone bioassay using laboratory-reared mosquitoes; Kisumu strain (R-70) of Anopheles gambiae ss. Cone bioassay was done every fortnight for a period of 152 days. The WHO Pesticide Evaluation Scheme (WHOPES) threshold (80% mortality) was used as cut-off point for acceptable residual efficacy. Results: A total of 5,800 mosquitoes were subjected to contact cone bioassay to test residual efficacy of lambda-cyhalothrin. There was a statistically significant variation in residual efficacy between the different types of wall surfaces (r = 0.24; p < 0.001). Residual efficacy decreased with increasing pH of the substrate (r = -0.5; p < 0.001). Based on WHOPES standards, shorter residual efficacy (42-56 days) was found in wall substrates made of cement, limestone, mud-daub, oil paint and white wash. Burnt bricks retained the residual efficacy up to 134 days while galvanized iron sheets, palm thatch and wood retained the recommended residual efficacy beyond 152 days. Conclusion: The study revealed a wide variation in residual efficacy of micro encapsulated formulation of lambda-cyhalothrin across the different types of wall surfaces studied. In areas where malaria transmission is bimodal and wall surfaces with short residual efficacy comprise > 20% of sprayable structures, two rounds of IRS using lambda-cyhalothrin should be considered. Further studies are required to investigate the impact of sprayable surfaces on residual efficacy of other insecticides commonly used for IRS in Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania.",2015,ann.lindberg,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

Evaluation of Different Nets against Phlebotomus argentipes, the Vector of Visceral Leishmaniasis in Nepal","In the Indian subcontinent, Leishmania donovani, the parasite causing visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is transmitted by the sand fly vector Phlebotomus argentipes. Long lasting insecticide treated nets (LN) have been postulated as alternative or complement to Indoor Residual Spraying but there are few field studies evaluating the entomological efficacy of different nets against this vector. We conducted two crossover trials in a VL endemic area in Nepal to compare the barrier effect of (1) LN with different mesh sizes (156 holes/inch(2) vs 625 holes/inch(2)) and (2) alpha-cypermethrin treated LN and untreated nets having the same mesh size (156 holes/inch(2)). Each crossover trial had two arms consisting of a sequence of two different nets for 8 nights. We used 10 cattle sheds per trial. A cow placed under the net was used as bait. CDC light traps placed inside the nets were used to evaluate the number of P. argentipes crossing the net barrier. Negative binomial generalized estimating equation (GEE) population-averaged models adjusted by night and sequence were used to estimate the barrier effect of the different nets. The crossover trials conducted in a rural village in Morang district (South-eastern Nepal) demonstrated that reducing the size of the holes in treated nets (625 holes/inch(2)) increased the barrier effect of LN by 77% (95% confidence interval (CI): 56%-88%) compared with treated nets with larger holes (156 holes/inch(2)). Treating nets with alpha-cypermethrin reduced the number of P. argentipes captured inside the nets by 77% (95% CI: 27%-93%) compared with untreated nets.

This study investigated the anti-feeding efficacy and the immediate insecticidal efficacy (knock-down effect) of topical treatment of dogs with a new commercially available combination of indoxacarb and permethrin (Activyl (R) Tick Plus), compared with a negative control. Methods: Sedated dogs were individually exposed to unfed female sandflies in a darkened chamber for one hour 2, 7, 14, 21 and 29 days after treatment. Mean fly feeding and survival rates in the two groups after one hour of exposure were used to calculate the anti-feeding efficacy and the knock-down effect, respectively.

Methods: Initial efficacy testing of a new candidate LLIB was carried out at LSHTM and KCMUCo, before and after washing, in cone and ball bioassays and arm-in-cage tests against pyrethroid susceptible Anopheles gambiae. A small scale field trial was conducted using veranda-trap experimental huts in northern Tanzania against wild An. arabiensis and Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes. Treatments included unwashed and 5 times washed permethrin treated LLIB and blankets hand-treated with permethrin (ITB), untreated blankets, and a holed unwashed Olyset net. Results: Cone test mortality was 75% for LLIB when unwashed, but decreased to 32% after 5 washes and <10% after 10 washes. In arm-in-cage tests protection against biting was 100% for LLIBs regardless of the number of washes while reduction in landings was 79% when unwashed, 75% after 5 washes, but declined to 41% after 10 and 33% after 20 washes. In ball bioassays using pyrethroid resistant An. arabiensis, mortality was low in all treatments (<35%) and there was no significant difference in mortality between Olyset net, LLIB or ITB (p > 0.05). Percentage mortality of An. arabiensis in huts with LLIB unwashed (26%) was not statistically different to Olyset net (31%, p = 0.5). The 5 times washed LLIB reduced blood-feeding by 49% which was equivalent to Olyset net (p > 0.086). There was no significant difference in percentage blood-feeding between LLIB and ITB unwashed or 5 times washed (p = 0.147 and p = 0.346 respectively). The 5 times washed LLIB reduced blood-feeding of Culex quinquefasciatus by 40%, although the Olyset provided the greatest protection with 85% inhibition. ELISA analysis of a sub-sample of blood fed mosquitoes showed that not all had fed on humans in the huts, therefore blood-feeding inhibition may have been underestimated. Conclusions: This trial demonstrated the potential of LLIBs to provide substantial personal protection even against pyrethroid resistant mosquitoes.

Methods: A randomized, investigator-blinded, multi-centered field study compared the flea-and tick-control efficacy for dogs over a 12-week period with either a single oral dose of Bravecto (TM) (fluralaner) formulated as a chewable tablet or with three sequential topical Frontline (TM) (fipronil) treatments. Individual dogs were the experimental unit for ticks and households were the experimental unit for fleas. A total of 108 tick-infested dogs were treated with Bravecto (TM) (fluralaner) and 54 tick-infested dogs were treated with Frontline T (fipronil). Dogs in 115 flea-infested households received Bravecto (TM) (fluralaner) and dogs in 61 flea-infested households received Frontline (TM) (fipronil). Flea and tick counts were conducted on all dogs at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 following initial treatment and efficacy was calculated as the mean percent reduction in tick or flea count at each time point compared with the mean pretreatment initiation count for each treatment group. Additionally, the percentages of tick-free and flea-free households were determined. Results: At weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, Bravecto (TM) (fluralaner) flea-control efficacy in treated households was 99.2%, 99.8%, 99.8%, and 99.9% respectively, while Frontline (TM) (fipronil) efficacy was 94.1%, 93.0%, 96.0%, and 97.3%, respectively. Bravecto (TM) (fluralaner) tick-control efficacy on treated dogs at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 was 99.9%, 99.9%, 99.7%, and 100%, respectively, and Frontline (TM) (fipronil) tick efficacy was 97.6%, 93.8%, 100%, and 100%, respectively.

Prevention of tick borne diseases in forestry workers is essentially based on the use of appropriate clothing. The objective of this pragmatic, randomized, controlled trial was to assess the potential benefit of permethrin-treated working trousers for the prevention of tick infestation during forestry work. Materials and methods. N=164 male forestry workers were equipped for a period of 16 weeks with permethrin-treated (intervention group - I) or untreated work trousers (control group II). Subgroups, according to the use of trousers with (I-1, II-1) or without cut protection lining (I-2,II-2) were constituted. Tick infestation (quantity of ticks on the body surface) was assessed by questionnaire after 16 workdays. Control and intervention groups were compared by calculating the infestation rate (percentage of subjects with ticks) and the average number of ticks per workday. Results. The infestation rate in the intervention group was significantly lower than in the control group (36.6 vs. 63.4%, p=0.001; Fisher-test). Further analysis revealed a significant reduction of tick infestation by permethrin treatment only for subjects wearing trousers without the cut protection lining (I-2: 34.2 vs. II-2: 80.0%, p<0.001), while users of cut protection trousers did not benefit from such treated trousers (I-1: 38.6 vs. II-1:47.6%, n.s.). Similar results were found for comparisons based on the average number of ticks per workday. Conclusions. The use of permethrin-treated trousers does not completely prevent tick infestations. Improvement of tick protection has been shown only for some applications, but not in general. Additional prevention measures are therefore still indispensable.",2014,tobias.lilja,4,"Not applicable (vector study)",Humans

In 2007, Netprotect was granted WHOPES interim recommendation after Phase I and II evaluations. Present study evaluates Netprotect in a Phase III trial in rural Cambodia. Methods: A randomized, prospective longitudinal study design was used to assess the performance of Netprotect over a period of three years, using conventionally-treated nets and a WHOPES recommended LLIN (PermaNet 2.0) as positive controls. The primary outcomes were the physical integrity, insecticide content and cone bioassay performance using. Results: The baseline deltamethrin concentration of 43% of Netprotect nets were below the tolerance limit while 27% of PermaNet 2.0 nets were above the target dose limits. By 36 months Netprotect retained 35% while PermaNet 2.0 retained 49% of baseline insecticide dose. Moreover the proportion of the inactive deltamethrin R-alpha isomer in the Netprotect nets was 33% at the baseline and increased to 69% after three years while it was low and almost constant for PermaNet 2.0 (3-7%). Only 71% of Netprotect met the WHO criteria for bio-efficacy after three years while at least 80% is required. Moreover Netprotect nets failed for the WHOPES criteria after 12 and 24 months. The reference LLIN met the WHOPES criteria throughout the study. Over the entire three years the reference LLIN did obtain significant higher mosquito mortality than Netprotect. The physical integrity was based on the proportionate hole index and after three years, 25% of Netprotect and 30% of PermaNet 2.0 were in a mediocre or poor state. Conclusion: Netprotect did not meet the minimum WHO criteria for bio-efficacy after 12, 24 and 36 months. The use of a reference LLIN as positive control was helpful of data interpretation. However, for future three-year studies, it is essential that before initiating any study nets should be checked for their specifications and this for both the candidate LLIN as well as for the reference LLIN.

The first 19 wks, during spring and early summer (March-June) temperatures were optimum for tick survival, producing high tick numbers on treated animals (9 - 63 ticks) which were not different from untreated animals. During this time tags provided <= 53.7% control. By contrast, during the summer through midfall (July-October), high temperatures caused dramatic natural declines in the tick population, but tick numbers on treated animals were always lower (0 - 3 ticks) than untreated animals (4 - 16 ticks). Control during this period was 72 - 100%, indicating tags had a negative impact on tick survival beyond the natural attrition caused by high temperatures. During the last 9 wks (midOctober to midDecember), temperatures were again highly conducive to tick survival and tick numbers on untreated animals rebounded to previous levels (7 - 56 ticks), whereas treated animals produced significantly fewer ticks (1 - 9 ticks), resulting in 73 - 98% control. Results demonstrated that timing of ear tag application was critical to the expected efficacy.

It is known that adult mosquitoes are attracted to dark surfaces, and therefore, black cotton cloths impregnated with Metarhizium anisopliae alone or in combination with the insecticide imidacloprid (IMI) were tested under laboratory conditions. Black cloths impregnated with fungus were also tested in large-cage trials under natural extradomicile conditions. Blood-fed Rockefeller and wild-type strain Aedes aegypti had higher levels of survival when compared with sucrose-fed counterparts following exposure to fungus-impregnated cloths. However, when blood-fed A. aegypti were exposed to a combination of M. anisopliae + IMI, the survival rates were statistically equal to those of sucrose-fed females. Large-cage trials showed significant decreases in A. aegypti survival following a minimum 12 h exposure of the mosquitoes to fungus-impregnated cloths. Increased exposure times results in further reductions in survival. The synergism between M. anisopliae and IMI resulted in reduced survival rates independent of feeding regime under laboratory conditions. Fungus-impregnated cloths tested under simulated field conditions, considered to be unfavourable for fungal infection, resulted in significant reductions in adult A. aegypti survival.

Hamilton","Insecticide-impregnated netting as a potential tool for long-lasting control of the leishmaniasis vector Lutzomyia longipalpis in animal shelters","Background: Leishmaniasis remains a serious neglected disease, with more than 350 million people potentially at risk worldwide. Control strategies often rely on spraying residual insecticides to target populations of the sand fly vectors that transmit Leishmania parasites when blood-feeding. These programmes are often difficult to sustain effectively, as sand fly resting sites must be resprayed on a regular basis. Here, we investigate whether application of insecticide-impregnated netting to a surface could act as an alternative to residual spraying for controlling the American visceral leishmaniasis vector Lutzomyia longipalpis. Methods: Female L. longipalpis from our laboratory colony were exposed for 1 h to three treatments applied to plywood surfaces: 2% permethrin-impregnated netting (Olyset), 20 mg a.i.m -2 micro-encapsulated lambda-cyhalothrin (Demand CS) and a no-treatment control. We compared the speed at which these treatments acted, by measuring the percentage of sand flies killed both immediately after exposure to the treatment for 1 hour, as well as the number that had died 24 h after the 1 hour exposure. We repeated the experiment at 6 and 12 months following application to test the effectiveness of each treatment over time. Results: When first applied, the lambda-cyhalothrin killed more sand flies in the first hour than the permethrin-impregnated netting. However, the effectiveness of the lambda-cyhalothrin diminished over time, so that there was no difference between the two treatments at 12 months. Both killed more sand flies than the control. When measured 24 h following exposure, both test treatments had killed close to 100% of sand flies when first applied, but while the lethal effect of the netting was maintained at close to 100% over 12 months, the effectiveness of the residual insecticide diminished to approximately 80% after 6 months. Conclusions: The results of these initial laboratory experiments indicate that covering surfaces with insecticide impregnated netting material may provide a longer-lasting solution for killing sand flies than residual spraying. Field trials are needed to identify the feasibility of treating surfaces with netting or similar impregnated materials as part of a control program. In targeting L. longipalpis, the greatest benefits may be seen in treating animal sheds with netting, where these sand flies aggregate in large numbers, and which can be difficult to treat repeatedly by conventional spraying.",2013,ann.lindberg,4,"Leishmania infantum","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

Additionally, Olyset nets were evaluated for their biological activity using WHO cone bioassay test by susceptible colony of Anopheles stephensi (Beech strain) and then for insecticide residues by employing high performance thin layer chromatography. Malaria incidence was measured by passive and active case detection from all study population. In total 2115 adult anopheline mosquitoes were collected and identified using morphological characters. They comprised of seven species: Anopheles dthali (Liston), A. culicifacies (Giles). A. stephensi (Liston). A. superpictus (Grassi), A.fluviatilis (James), A. moghulensis (Christophers) and A. turkhudi (Liston). A. dthali, A. culicifacies and A. stephensi were most prevalent species in both areas. In the Olyset net study area, there was a significant reduction of 41.1%, 54.4%, 59.39% and 64.1% in the indoor-resting density of A. culicifacies, A. stephensi, A. dthali and A. superpictus, respectively, with an overall reduction of 39.3% in total mosquitoes in comparison with untreated net area. A significant reduction was also observed in human blood index of vector species in the Olyset net villages. Bioefficacy test results of Olyset nets showed that the median knockdown time was 1.48 and 3.25 min, while the average mortality rate was 100% and 72.3%+/- 7.07 in baseline and after 1 year of intervention, respectively. The average permethrin content reached to 68.31% (683.1 mg/m(2)) of the initial insecticide dose of 937 +/- 21.69 mg/m(2) (nearly 1000 mg/m(2)) at the end of intervention. Malaria incidence was reduced by 96.6% and 64.8% in the village with Olyset nets and in the villages with untreated nets, respectively. During intervention period, there was a reduction of 93.2% in malaria incidence in Olyset net area as compared to the untreated area. This study indicated that Olyset nets have a major impact on malaria vectors and disease burden; therefore it could be recommended as an effective personal protection tool for malaria control in malarious areas.

Efficacy was evaluated against the flea Ctenocephalides felis felis, and the ticks Ixodes ricinus, Amblyomma americanum and Rhipicephalus turanicus. The number of studies was so large that only a general overview can be presented in this abstract. Methods: Preventive efficacy was evaluated by infesting groups of cats (n = 8-10) with C. felis felis and/or I. ricinus, A. americanum or R. turanicus at monthly intervals at least, for a period of up to 8 months. Efficacy against fleas was evaluated 24 to 48 h after treatment and 24 h after infestation, and against ticks at 6 h (repellent) or 48 h (acaricidal) after infestation. Efficacy against flea larvae was evaluated over a period of 8 months by incubating viable flea eggs on blanket samples after cat contact. In all cases efficacy was calculated by comparison with untreated negative control groups. Results: Efficacy against fleas (24 h) generally exceeded 95% until study termination. In vitro efficacy against flea larvae exceeded 92% until Day 90 and then declined to 67% at the conclusion of the study on Day 230. Sustained acaricidal (48 h) efficacy over a period of eight months was consistently 100% against I. ricinus from Day 2 after treatment, 100% against A. americanum, except for 98.5% and 97.7% at two time-points, and between 94% and 100% against R. turanicus. From Day 2 until 8 months after treatment the repellent (6 h), efficacy was consistently 100% against I. ricinus, and between 54.8% and 85.4% against R. turanicus. Conclusion: The rapid insecticidal and acaricidal properties of the medicated collars against newly-acquired infestations of fleas and ticks and their sustained high levels of preventive efficacy have been clearly demonstrated. Taking into account the seasonality of fleas and ticks, the collars have the potential to prevent the transmission of vector-borne diseases and other conditions directly associated with infestation throughout the season of parasite abundance.",2012,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","Cat (Felis catus)"

Additionally, clinical specific aspects of the infestations were registered. The study was carried out during of March-April 2012, in a southern area of Romania (Colibasi village, Giurgiu County). The therapeutic efficacy of four different acaricides: Deltamethrin (pirethroid), Amitraz (formamidine), Diazinon (organophosphate), and Ivermectine (macrocyclic lactone) on natural tick infestation in sheep was evaluated. The animals (n=40) were divided into four groups (n=10/group) corresponding to the four used drugs. The first three products were used by dipping, in concentration of 0.05% for Delthametrin, 0.05% for Amitraz, and 0.04% for Diazinon. Ivermectine (1%) was subcutaneously injected (0.2 mg/kg). The animals were examined before and after treatment at 3, 5, 7, 14 and 21 days. The number of ticks per animal, the main elective body regions for tick attachment, and the associated lesions, were also registered. A total number of 1054 ticks (938 females, 116 males) were collected from infested sheep, all belonging to the Dermacentor marginatus species. The body areas highly infested were, in order of prevalence: the substernal area (63.6%), sides of the neck (14.2%) and the tail (7.1%). Lesions associated with tick infestation consisted of local irritations and inflammations, nodular dermatitis and micro abscesses. The best acaricidal efficacy was registered for Delthametrin (79.5%, at 3 days and 100% at 5 days p.t.) and Amitraz (90.4%, 96.4% and 100% at 3, 5 and 7 days p.t. respectively); both acaricids preserved full protection at 14 and 21 days after treatment.

Implications of the findings are examined in the context of potential synergies and redundancies where IRS and LLINs are combined. Methods: Bioassays were conducted monthly for six months on three LLIN types (Olyset PermaNet 2.0, and Icon Life) and three IRS treatments (2 g/m 2 pirimiphos-methyl, 2 g/m 2 DDT and 0.03 g/m 2 lambda-cyhalothrin, sprayed on mud walls and palm ceilings of experimental huts). Tests used susceptible laboratory-reared An. arabiensis exposed in cones (nets and IRS) or wire balls (nets only). Susceptibility of wild populations was assessed using WHO diagnostic concentrations and PCR for knock-down resistance ( kdr) genes. Results: IRS treatments killed ?85% of mosquitoes exposed on palm ceilings and ?90% of those exposed on mud walls, but up to 50% of this toxicity decayed within 1-3 months, except for DDT. By 6th month, only 7.5%, 42.5% and 30.0% of mosquitoes died when exposed to ceilings sprayed with pirimiphos-methyl, DDT or lambda-cyhalothrin respectively, while 12.5%, 36.0% and 27.5% died after exposure to mud walls sprayed with the same insecticides. In wire-ball assays, mortality decreased from 98.1% in 1st month to 92.6% in 6th month in tests on PermaNet 2.0, from 100% to 61.1% on Icon Life and from 93.2% to 33.3% on Olyset nets. In cone bioassays, mortality reduced from 92.8% in 1st month to 83.3% in 6th month on PermaNet 2.0, from 96.9% to 43.80% on Icon Life and from 85.6% to 14.6% on Olyset. Wild An. arabiensis were 100% susceptible to DDT, 95.8% to deltamethrin, 90.2% to lambda cyhalothrin and 95.2% susceptible to permethrin. No kdr gene mutations were detected. Conclusions: In bioassays where sufficient contact with treated surfaces is assured, LLINs and IRS kill high proportions of susceptible An. arabiensis mosquitoes, though these efficacies decay gradually for LLINs and rapidly for IRS. It is, therefore, important to always add intact nets in sprayed houses, guaranteeing protection even after the IRS decays, and to ensure accurate timing, quality control and regular re-spraying in IRS programmes. By contrast, adding IRS in houses with intact LLINs is unlikely to improve protection relative to LLINs alone, since there is no guarantee that unfed vectors would rest long enough on the sprayed surfaces, and because of the rapid IRS decay. However, there is need to clarify these effects using data from observations of free flying mosquitoes in huts. Physiological susceptibility of An. arabiensis in the area remains 100% against DDT, but is slightly reduced against pyrethroids, necessitating caution over possible spread of resistance. The loss of LLIN toxicity, particularly Olyset nets suggests that protection offered by these nets against An. arabiensis may be primarily due to physical bite prevention rather than insecticidal efficacy.",2012,thomas.rosendal,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

For the two prevention of attachment studies, 20 purpose-bred beagles were allocated each to two equal groups based on pretreatment tick counts (treated and untreated). Each dog was exposed to 50 adult Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Dermacentor variabilis weekly starting 24 h after treatment. In study 1 infestations with R. sanguineus were discontinued after Day 7 but continued to Day 28 for D. variabilis in both studies. Counts of ticks by species were made 2, 4 and 24 h after exposure to ticks. Ticks not attaching to dogs were evaluated for viability. For the evaluation of detachment study, 16 purposebred beagles were allocated each to two equal groups based on pretreatment tick counts (treated and untreated). Each dog was infested with 50 unfed R. sanguineus and D. variabilis adults on Day -2. Ticks were thumb counted without removal on all dogs on Day -1, and at 4, 12, and 24 h after treatment. Ticks were counted and removed at 48 h after treatment. Dogs treated with the novel combination had significantly (p < 0.05) lower total numbers of attached R. sanguineus and D. variabilis than untreated controls at 4 h through Day 7. For R. sanguineus, percent reduction of attachment at 24 h after infestation through Day 29 ranged from 94.5% to 100%. For D. variabilis, the percent reduction of attachment at 24 h through Day 22 was above 98.0%. These studies demonstrate that novel combination can disrupt attachment of R. sanguineus and D. variabilis for tip to 28 days following treatment. Of those ticks that are exposed to the treatment, even if they do not attach to the dog and remain in the environment, greater than 90% (p < 0.05) die within 24 h for 2-3 weeks following treatment. Also, for those dogs infested with ticks at the time of treatment, the novel combination causes significant detachment (p < .05) starting at 12 h and reaching 98.9% by 48 h after treatment. This product provides an effective means for controlling ticks infesting dogs and limiting the spread of tick transmitted diseases. Additionally, the mortality of ticks exposed to CERTIFECT will reduce infestation of the dog's environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Many North Carolina state employees with outdoor occupations report multiple tick bites each year, indicating that existing tick preventive strategies may be underutilized or ineffective. Treatment of clothing with permethrin, a nontoxic chemical with insecticidal, knockdown, and repellent properties, is highly effective against ticks. However, most permethrin products must be reapplied after several washings to maintain insecticidal activity. Recently, a factory-based method for long-lasting permethrin impregnation of clothing has been developed by Insect Shield, Inc., that allows clothing to retain insecticidal activity for over 70 washes. Methods: A nonrandomized open label pilot study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of Insect Shield-treated clothing for the prevention of tick bites among 16 outdoor workers from the North Carolina Division of Water Quality under actual field conditions. Participants completed questionnaires at the start of follow-up (March, 2008) and at the end of follow-up (September, 2008), and tick bites and outdoor work hours were reported on weekly tick bite logs for the entire follow-up period. Results: Subjects wearing Insect Shield-treated clothing had a 93% reduction (p<0.0001) in the total incidence of tick bites compared to subjects using standard tick bite prevention measures. Conclusion: This study provides preliminary evidence that long-lasting permethrin-impregnated clothing may be highly effective against tick bites.",2011,tobias.lilja,4,"Not applicable (vector study)",Humans

In this context, one of the pathways available for malaria vector control would be to investigate alternative classes of insecticides with different mode of action than that of pyrethroids. The goal of this study was to evaluate under field conditions the efficacy of a carbamate (bendiocarb) and an organophosphate (fenitrothion) against pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae s.s. Methods: Wild populations and females from laboratory colonies of five days old An. gambiae were bio-assayed during this study. Two pyrethroids (deltamethrin and alphacypermethrin), an organophosphate (fenitrothion), a carbamate (bendiocarb) and a mixture of an organophosphate (chlorpyriphos+a pyrethroid deltamethrin) were compared in experimental huts as IRS treatments. Insecticides were applied in the huts using a hand-operated compression sprayer. The deterrency, exophily, blood feeding rate and mortality induced by these insecticides against An. gambiae were compared to the untreated control huts. Results Deltamethrin, alphacypermethrin and bendiocarb treatment significantly reduced mosquito entry into the huts (p<0.05) compared to untreated huts. Blood feeding rates in huts treated with fenitrothion and the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin were reduced from 10.95% respectively to 3.7% and 4.47% three months after treatment and from 10.20% to 4.4% and 2.04% four months after treatment. Exophily rates in huts with deltamethrin, alphacypermethrin and the mixture chlorpyriphos/deltamethrin were significantly higher than in the huts with fenitrothion.

Against a backdrop of increasing long lasting net (LN) coverage, we examined the effect of combining permethrin-treated plastic sheeting (ITPS) with LNs in Burkina Faso. Methods: A verandah trap experimental hut trial of ITPS with or without Olyset LN was conducted in the Vallee du Kou near Bobo-Dioulasso, where the two molecular forms of Anopheles gambiae s.s., S (frequency 65%) and M (frequency 35%), occur. The S form is mostly pyrethroid resistant (F kdr =92%) owing to the kdr mechanism, and the M form is mostly kdr susceptible (F kdr =7%). The treatment arms included ITPS, Olyset, ITPS plus Olyset, ITPS plus untreated net (with or without holes), and untreated control. Results: ITPS was significantly inferior to Olyset LN in terms of mortality (37% vs 63%), blood feeding inhibition (20% vs 81%) and deterrence (0 vs 42%) effects, and hence altogether inferior as a means of personal protection (16% vs 89%). The addition of ITPS to Olyset did not improve mortality (62%), blood feeding inhibition (75%), deterrence (50%) or personal protection (88%) over that of Olyset used alone. Use of untreated nets - both holed and intact - with ITPS provided greater protection from blood-feeding. The intact net/ITPS combination killed more mosquitoes than ITPS on its own. Conclusions Although ITPS has a potential role for community control of malaria, at low coverage it is unlikely to be as good as Olyset LNs for household protection. The combination of pyrethroid IRS and pyrethroid LN - as practiced in some countries - is unlikely to be additive except, perhaps, at high levels of IRS coverage.

Compared to geometric mean live tick counts in the control group at Days 9, 16, 23 and 30 after treatment, the 50 mg/kg spinosad treatment group demonstrated 67.8, 49.1, 52.1 and 5.0% reductions, while the 100 mg/kg spinosad treatment group demonstrated 88.6, 70.6, 61.9 and 71.3% reductions, respectively. This pilot efficacy study demonstrated that a single oral treatment with technical spinosad in gelatin capsules, at 50 and 100 mg/kg, provides high efficacy against existing R. sanguineus infestations within 24 h of dosing, and suggests that there is some post-treatment residual tick control in dogs for up to I month.

Therefore, field studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of ZeroFly (R) plastic sheeting treated with deltamethrin on prevailing disease vectors Anopheles culicifacies and An. fluviatilis and its impact on malaria transmission in one of the highly endemic areas of Orissa. Methods: The study was conducted in Birkera block of Sundargarh district, Orissa State. The study area comprised 3 villages, which were randomized as ZeroFly plastic sheet, untreated plastic sheet and no sheet area. ZeroFly plastic sheets and untreated plastic sheets were fixed in study and control villages respectively covering all the rooms in each household. Longitudinal studies were conducted on the bioefficacy with the help of cone bioassays, monitoring of the mosquito density through hand catch, floor sheet and exit trap collections and fortnightly domiciliary active surveillance in all the study villages. Results: In ZeroFly plastic sheeting area, there was a significant reduction of 84.7 per cent in the entry rate of total mosquitoes in comparison to pre-intervention phase. There was 56.2 per cent immediate mortality in total mosquitoes in houses with ZeroFly sheeting. The overall feeding success rate of mosquitoes in the trial village was only 12.5 per cent in comparison to 49.7 and 51.1 per cent in villages with untreated plastic sheet and no sheet respectively. There was a significant reduction of 65.0 and 70.5 per cent in malaria incidence in ZeroFly plastic sheeting area as compared to untreated plastic sheet and no sheet area respectively.

This resistance may compromise malaria vector control strategies that are currently in use in endemic areas. In this context, a new tool for management of resistant mosquitoes based on the combination of a pyrethroid-treated bed net and carbamate-treated plastic sheeting was developed. Methods: In the laboratory, the insecticidal activity and wash resistance of four carbamate-treated materials: a cotton/polyester blend, a polyvinyl chloride tarpaulin, a cotton/polyester blend covered on one side with polyurethane, and a mesh of polypropylene fibres was tested. These materials were treated with bendiocarb at 100 mg/m(2) and 200 mg/m(2) with and without a binding resin to find the best combination for field studies. Secondly, experimental hut trials were performed in southern Benin to test the efficacy of the combined use of a pyrethroid-treated bed net and the carbamate-treated material that was the most wash-resistant against wild populations of pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae and Culex quinquefasciatus. Results: Material made of polypropylene mesh (PPW) provided the best wash resistance (up to 10 washes), regardless of the insecticide dose, the type of washing, or the presence or absence of the binding resin. The experimental hut trial showed that the combination of carbamate-treated PPW and a pyrethroid-treated bed net was extremely effective in terms of mortality and inhibition of blood feeding of pyrethroid-resistant An. gambiae. This efficacy was found to be proportional to the total surface of the walls. This combination showed a moderate effect against wild populations of Cx. quinquefasciatus, which were strongly resistant to pyrethroid. Conclusion: These preliminary results should be confirmed, including evaluation of entomological, parasitological, and clinical parameters.

Method: An experimental station, based on the model of West Africa and adapted to the behaviour of the target species, was built in southern Vietnam. The study design was adapted from the WHO phase 2 guidelines. The study arms included a conventionally treated polyester net (CTN) with deltamethrin washed just before exhaustion, the WHO recommended long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) PermaNet 2.0(R) unwashed and 20 times washed and PermaNet 3.0(R), designed for the control of pyrethroid resistant vectors, unwashed and 20 times washed. Results: The nets still provided personal protection against the resistant An. epiroticus population. The personal protection ranged from 67% for deltamethrin CTN to 85% for unwashed PermaNet 3.0. Insecticide resistance in the An. epiroticus mosquitoes did not seem to alter the deterrent effect of pyrethroids. A significant higher mortality was still observed among the treatment arms despite the fact that the An. epiroticus population is resistant against the tested insecticides. Conclusion: This study shows that CTN and LLINs still protect individuals against a pyrethroid resistant malaria vector from the Mekong region, where insecticide resistance is caused by a metabolic mechanism.

Repellents provide a practical means of protection against tick bites and can therefore minimize the transmission of tick-borne diseases. We developed and tested seven different dodecanoic acid (DDA)-formulations for their efficacy in repelling host-seeking nymphs of I. ricinus by laboratory screening. The ultimately selected formulation was then used for comparative investigations of commercially available tick repellents in humans. Methods: Laboratory screening tests were performed using the Moving-object (MO) bioassay. All test formulations contained 10% of the naturally occurring active substance DDA and differed only in terms of the quantitative and qualitative composition of inactive ingredients and fragrances. The test procedure used in the human bioassays is a modification of an assay described by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and recommended for regulatory affairs. Repellency was computed using the equation: R=100-N R/N * 100, where N R is the number of non-repelled ticks, and N is the respective number of control ticks. All investigations were conducted in a controlled laboratory environment offering standardized test conditions. Results: All test formulations strongly repelled nymphs of I. ricinus (100-81% protection) as shown by the MO-bioassay. The majority of ticks dropped off the treated surface of the heated rotating drum that served as the attractant (1 mg/cm 2 repellent applied). The 10% DDA-based formulation, that produced the best results in laboratory screening, was as effective as the coconut oil-based reference product. The mean protection time of both preparations was generally similar and averaged 8 hours. Repellency investigations in humans showed that the most effective 10% DDA-based formulation (~1.67 mg/cm 2 applied) strongly avoided the attachment of I. ricinus nymphs and adults for at least 6 hours. The test repellent always provided protection (83-63%) against I. ricinus nymphs equivalent to the natural coconut oil based reference product and a better protection (88-75%) against adult ticks than the synthetic Icaridin-containing reference repellent. Conclusion: We found that the 10% DDA-based formulation (ContraZeck) is an easily applied and very effective natural repellent against I. ricinus ticks.

There were no significant differences in parasite counts between the nontreated control and the placebo-treated control groups for either fleas or ticks (P > 0.05) except for very slight reductions on Day 7 for fleas and Day 14 for ticks, demonstrating that the formulation excipients had no activity. The qualitative finger counts on Day I indicated that all of the insecticidal treatments resulted in a noticeable reduction in flea and tick numbers within I day of treatment. All of the metaflumizone and amitraz treatments and fipronil resulted in significantly lower flea and tick numbers relative to nontreated controls on all posttreatment count days (P < 0.05).

Method: Overnight tests were carried out in veranda-trap experimental huts in Vallee du Kou, where two molecular forms of A. gambiae, S and M, occur. The S form is mostly pyrethroid resistant due to the kdr mechanism, and the M form is mostly kdr susceptible. A variety of ITPS covered surfaces were tested, ranging from ceiling only to all walls plus ceiling covered. Results: ITPS had a major effect on the mortality of mosquitoes, the proportion killed being dependent upon the surface area covered. Homozygotes for kdr resistance showed lower rates of mortality than did heterozygotes or homozygotes for susceptibility. Deterred entry of mosquitoes and inhibition of blood feeding were also correlated with surface area covered. The mode of action and efficacy of ITPS seems to bear closer resemblance to that induced by indoor residual spraying (IRS) than to that induced by insecticide-treated nets. Conclusions: ITPS might be conceived as being equivalent to long-lasting or permanent IRS but without some of the operational constraints normally associated with spraying.

In scaled up bioassays the ULV formulation of cis-permethrin showed 100% mortality of A. aegypti adult mosquitoes at the beginning of the treatment (t = 0) and some mortality at 1 h post treatment of freshly introduced mosquitoes. It was concluded that cis-permethrin could be an excellent tool for control of A. aegypti and other vectors of medical importance, with fewer side effects and better cost-effectiveness than with the cyanopyrethroids.

Even if they showed a good efficacy in control conditions, their efficacy in the field, particularly in areas with resistance of Anopheles gambiae to pyrethroids, is not well documented. This study compares wide (OlysetR)) and small (Permanet(R)) mesh LLINs in field conditions, using entomological parameters. Methods: The two LLINs were tested in a rice-growing area of south-western Burkina Faso ( West Africa) with year around high density of the main malaria vector An. gambiae s.s. In the study village (VK6), there is a mixed population of two molecular forms of An. gambiae, the S-form which dominates during the rainy season and the M-form which dominates the rest of the year. The two LLINs Olyset(R) and Permanet(R) were distributed in the village and 20 matched houses were selected for comparison with four houses without treated nets. Results: Mosquito entrance rate was ten fold higher in control houses than in houses with LLINs and there was no difference between the two net types. Among mosquitoes found in the houses, 36% were dead in LLIN houses compared to 0% in control houses. Blood feeding rate was 80% in control houses compared to 43% in LLIN houses. The type of net did not significantly impact any of these parameters. No mosquitoes were found inside Permanet(R), whereas dead or dying mosquitoes were collected inside the Olyset(R). More than 60% of mosquitoes found on top or inside the nets had had blood meals from cattle, as shown by ELISA analysis. Conclusion: The percentage of blood-fed mosquitoes in a bed net study does not necessarily determine net success. The efficacy of the two types of LLINs was comparable, during a period when the S-form of An. gambiae was carrying the kdr gene. Significantly higher numbers of mosquitoes were collected in control houses compared to intervention houses, indicating that the LLINs provided an additional deterrent effect, which enhanced their expected prevention capacity.",2006,thomas.rosendal,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

Treated nets were used in one village, and in the two control villages, one used untreated nets and the other used indoor spraying with DDT, without nets. In this area the primary malaria vectors are Anopheles culicifacies Giles sensu lato (Diptera: Culicidae) and An. fluviatilis James s.l., which are both endophagic and endophilic, and fully susceptible to deltamethrin. Treatment of a 10-m(2) mosquito net with one of the tablets gave a deltamethrin deposit of 25 mg/m(2). Bioassays repeated on domestically used nets over 7 months showed persistence of almost 100% mortality of An. fluviatilis, whereas An. culicifacies showed a decline from 100% to 71% mortality over this period, after which the nets were re-treated and bioassays were not continued. The sum of collections of mosquitoes resting in village houses and those in exit traps and dead on floor sheets showed a reduction in the numbers of the two vector species due to the treated nets, compared with untreated or no nets, but no reduction in other anophelines or Culex species. Large proportions of the collections of the vector and non-vector anophelines were dead on the floor sheets, but among Culex, mortality was delayed. Treated and untreated nets reduced the proportion of anophelines that had blood-fed; the treated nets did so more effectively than the untreated in the case of An. culicifacies and of Culex mosquitoes. In rooms with treated nets a larger proportion of the total collections [dead + live] were in the exit traps, which can be attributed to the excito-repellent effect of deltamethrin. It is easier to pack and handle tablets of insecticide than liquid concentrate and the use of one tablet per net may be preferable to making up a large volume of diluted insecticide and dipping many nets at a time.",2005,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

From July to August 2004, 45 privately owned dogs of various sexes, ages, breeds, coat length and habits were enrolled in a trial carried out in an area (radius approximately 50 km) in Southern Italy. Three homogeneous groups (both for dog population and tick population) were formed: 15 dogs treated with imidacloprid 10% and permethrin 50% spot-on (group A), 15 dogs treated with fipronil 10% and methoprene 12% spot-on (group B) and 15 untreated dogs (group C). The dogs in each group were then sub-grouped according to their age and weight. Two different treatments were administered (time 0 and +28 days) to groups A and B, and the dogs were checked weekly for tick infestation until day +56 post-treatment (p.t.). Twenty-four areas distributed on the whole body surface were examined for ticks at each follow-up, while only at time 0 and at day +56 p.t., ticks were collected from the dogs and identified. For the immature stages a semi-quantitative method was adopted and the load of immature stages was evaluated and grouped into four classes up to day +56 p.t. when the mean number of immature ticks (MIT) for each infection class was evaluated. All the adult ticks collected were identified as brown dog ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus). Immature stages were first compared at day +28 p.t..

Increasing resistance of malaria vectors to pyrethroids threatens to reduce the potency of this important method of vector control. Among the strategies proposed for resistance management is to use a pyrethroid and a non-pyrethroid insecticide in combination on the same mosquito net, either separately or as a mixture. Mixtures are particularly promising if there is potentiation between the two insecticides as this would make it possible to lower the dosage of each, as has been demonstrated under laboratory conditions for a mixture of bifenthrin (pyrethroid) and carbosulfan (carbamate). The effect of these types of treatment were compared in experimental huts on wild populations of Anopheles gambiae Giles and the nuisance mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus Say, both of which are multi-resistant. Four treatments were evaluated in experimental huts over six months: the recommended dosage of 50 mg m(-2) bifenthrin, 300 mg m(-2) carbosulfan, a mosaic of 300 mg m(-2) carbosulfan on the ceiling and 50 mg m(-2) bifenthrin on the sides, and a mixture of 6.25 mg m(-2) carbosulfan and 25 mg m(-2) bifenthrin. The mixture and mosaic treatments did not differ significantly in effectiveness from carbosulfan and bifenthrin alone against anophelines in terms of deterrency, induced exophily, blood feeding inhibition and overall mortality, but were more effective than in earlier tests with deltamethrin.

In recent years, plastic sheeting (polythene tarpaulins) has replaced canvas as the utilitarian shelter material for displaced populations in complex emergencies. Advances in technology enable polythene sheeting to be impregnated with pyrethroid during manufacture. The efficacy of such material against mosquitoes when erected as shelters under typical refugee camp conditions is unknown. Tests were undertaken with free-flying mosquitoes on entomological study platforms in an Afghan refugee camp to compare the insecticidal efficacy of plastic tarpaulin sprayed with deltamethrin on its inner surface (target dose 30 mg/m(2) ), tarpaulin impregnated with deltamethrin (initially greater than or equal to 30 mg/m(2) ) during manufacture, and a tent made from the factory impregnated tarpaulin material. Preliminary tests done in the laboratory with Anopheles stephensi Liston (Diptera: Culicidae) showed that 1-min exposure to factory-impregnated tarpaulins would give 100% mortality even after outdoor weathering in a temperate climate for 12 weeks. Outdoor platform tests with the erected materials (baited with human subjects) produced mosquito mortality rates between 86-100% for sprayed or factory-impregnated tarpaulins and tents (average 40 anophelines and 200 culicines/per platform/night), whereas control mortality (with untreated tarpaulin) was no more than 5%. Fewer than 20% of mosquitoes blood-fed on human subjects under either insecticide-treated or non-treated shelters. The tarpaulin shelter was a poor barrier to host-seeking mosquitoes and treatment with insecticide did not reduce the proportion blood-feeding. Even so, the deployment of insecticide-impregnated tarpaulins in refugee camps, if used by the majority of refugees, has the potential to control malaria by killing high proportions of mosquitoes and so reducing the average life expectancy of vectors (greatly reducing vectorial capacity), rather than by directly protecting refugees from mosquito bites. Mass coverage with deltamethrin-sprayed or impregnated tarpaulins or tents has strong potential for preventing malaria in displaced populations affected by conflict.",2002,thomas.rosendal,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

Results of therapeutic efficacy of fipronil showed that with each increase in concentration there was a corresponding and often significant (P < 0.05) decrease in the numbers, fecundity and fertility of engorged females. The overall control of the Index of Reproduction (IR) achieved at 0.25 and 0.5% AI was 86.2 and 93.3%, respectively, while the control of the IR at the 1.0% AI concentration was 99.7%. The persistent efficacy of fipronil, like the therapeutic efficacy, was also dose related. The 0.25% AI treatment failed to provide complete protection (100%) against larval reinfestation, although control of the IR remained high (> 95%) for the first 6 weeks after treatment. In contrast, at 0.5% AI the control of the IR remained at 100% for the first 4 weeks after treatment, and was > 90% for an additional 2 weeks (6 weeks posttreatment). The 1.0% AI concentration afforded the longest residual activity, providing virtually 100% protection against larval reinfestation for 8 weeks after treatment was applied. Based on the results, neither the 0.25 or 0.5% AI concentration completely eliminated the immature stages of the tick (nymphs and larvae) on the host at the time of treatment (therapeutic efficacy), and the residual activity (persistent efficacy) did not prevent reinfestation by lan ae for long periods after treatment. While the 1.0% Al concentration provided both therapeutic and residual efficacy thar would be suitable for use in the eradication program, caution is still warranted because a few engorged females detached for up to 25 days after treatment, although none reproduced after the 6th day.

The continuous application of synthetic insecticides causes development of resistance in vector species, biological magnification of toxic substances through the food chain, and adverse effects on environmental quality and nontarget organisms including human health. Application of active toxic agents from plant extracts as an alternative mosquito control strategy was available from ancient times. These are nontoxic, easily available at affordable prices, biodegradable, and show broad-spectrum target-specific activities against different species of vector mosquitoes. In the present study, the larvicidal activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized using Sida acuta plant leaf extract against late third instar larvae of Culex quinquefasciatus, Anopheles stephensi, and Aedes aegypti was determined. Range of concentrations of synthesized AgNPs (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mu g/mL) and aqueous leaf extract (50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 mu g/mL) were tested against the larvae of C. quinquefasciatus, A. stephensi and A. aegypti. The synthesized AgNPs from S. acuta leaf were highly toxic than crude leaf aqueous extract in three important vector mosquito species. The results were recorded from UV-Vis spectrum, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis. Larvae were exposed to varying concentrations of aqueous crude extract and synthesized AgNPs for 24 h. Considerable mortality was evident after the treatment of S. acuta for all three important vector mosquitoes. The LC50 and LC90 values of S. acuta aqueous leaf extract appeared to be most effective against A. stephensi (LC50, 109.94 mu g/mL and LC90, 202.42 mu g/mL) followed by A. aegypti LC50 (119.32 mu g/mL and LC90, 213.84 mu g/mL) and C. quinquefasciatus (LC50, 130.30 mu g/mL and LC90, 228.20 mu g/mL). Synthesized AgNPs against the vector mosquitoes of A. stephensi, A. aegypti, and C. quinquefasciatus had the following LC50 and LC90 values: A. stephensi had LC50 and LC90 values of 21.92, and 41.07 mu g/mL; A. aegypti had LC50 and LC90 values of 23.96, and 44.05 mu g/mL; C. quinquefasciatus had LC50 and LC90 values of 26.13 and 47.52 mu g/mL. These results suggest that the use of S. acuta synthesized silver nanoparticles can be a rapid, environmentally safer biopesticide which can form a novel approach to develop effective biocides for controlling the target vector mosquitoes.

Current measures for sand fly control include mostly indoor interventions, such as residual spraying of dwellings (IRS) to target endophilic sand fly species with very limited number of vector control tools for outdoor interventions against exophilic sand flies. In this study we investigated the efficacy of ground ultra low volume (ULV) space spray applications of a deltamethrin based product against field populations of P. perfiliewi, a major nuisance and pathogen-transmitting sand fly species of the Mediterranean Basin. Sand fly flight activity patterns and flight height preference within candidate treatment sites (kennels) were determined prior to treatments in order to optimize the timing and application parameters of the spray applications. On average there was a distinct activity peak between 20.00–22.00 h for both male and female P. perfiliewi with more than 45% and 30% of the population sampled occurring between 20.00–21.00 h and 21.00–22.00 h, respectively. No significant difference was observed in sand fly numbers from sticky traps placed at 0.5 up to 1.5 m height. However, there was a significant decrease in sand fly numbers at 2 m indicating a preference of sand flies to fly below 2 m. The low and high application rate of deltamethrin resulted in mean sand fly population decrease of 18 and 66%, respectively between pre-and post-treatment trap nights. The percent mean population change in the untreated control area was a positive number (30%) indicating that there was an increase in numbers of sand flies trapped between pre- and post-treatment nights.

To support vector control interventions in DRC, we characterized the dynamics and impact of insecticide resistance in major malaria vectors in 2015. High Plasmodium infection rates were recorded in Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles funestus, with Plasmodium falciparum predominant over Plasmodium malariae. Both mosquito species exhibited high and multiple resistance to major public health insecticide classes. The extremely high resistance to permethrin and DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) in An. gambiae (low mortalities after 6 hours exposure) is worrisome, and is supported by a reduced insecticidal effect of bed nets against both mosquito species in laboratory tests. Metabolic and target site insensitivity mechanisms are driving this resistance in An. gambiae, but only the former was observed in An. funestus.

Dengue vectors have developed resistance to insecticides and currently used larvicides show only short-term effectiveness. As a result, an alternative larvicide is urgently needed. The present study evaluated the larvicidal effectiveness of long-lasting pyriproxyfen resin discs (SumiLarv®2MR) against dengue virus vectors in schools in Hlaing Thar Yar Township, Yangon. Results: The proportion of Aedes mosquito-infested containers was significantly reduced in the schools applied with the larvicide (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.12-0.48) while there was little reduction noted in the control schools (OR: 0.97, 95% CI: 0.55-1.72). The density of infested containers was also significantly reduced in the intervention schools (Beta: -1.50, 95% CI: -1.98- -1.04), but there was no significant reduction in density in the control schools (Beta: -0.19, 95% CI: -0.53-0.14). The proportion of adult emergence was less than 20% in the treated water collected from the intervention schools for six months, while the proportion was over 90% in the untreated water. In addition, eight-month-old SumiLarv®2MR resin discs were still 100% effective when tested in the laboratory. More than 50% of the discs disappeared from treated containers within two months of intervention. Conclusions: SumiLarv®2MR was effective in reducing Aedes-infested containers at least six months after its application in schools.

Dengue control programmes are facing great challenges due to development of insecticide resistance among vector mosquitoes. Information on susceptibility status to different insecticides is important for national programmes to formulate vector control strategies. Methods: We have studied the larval susceptibility of Aedes albopictus to temephos and adult susceptibility to 4% DDT, 0.05% deltamethrin, and 5% malathion as per WHO protocols in the northern districts of West Bengal. Polymorphisms in the VGSC gene were studied by direct sequencing of PCR products. Results: The Ae. albopictus larval population showed sensitive [Resistance Ratio (RR99)&lt;3] to moderate levels of resistance (5&lt;RR99&gt;10) to temephos at different study sites. Adult bioassay results revealed that Ae. albopictus was highly resistant to DDT [Corrected Mortality (CM) &lt; 90%] in all the study sites and susceptible to deltamethrin and malathion (CM &gt; 98%), except in Dhupguri where a low level of resistance to deltamethrin (CM = 96.25%) was recorded. None of the six important kdr mutations (S953P, I975M/V, L978, V980G, F1474C, D1703Y) were found in the VGSC of studied mosquitoes, but we identified 11 synonymous and 1 non-synonymous mutation in the VGSC gene. Conclusion: The higher susceptibility level to deltamethrin and malathion, along with the absence of important kdr mutations indicates that these two insecticides are still effective against Ae. albopictus in the study areas. The susceptibility status of temephos should be monitored closely as low to moderate levels of resistance were observed in few sites.

Insecticides of botanical origin have been reported as useful for control of agricultural and public health insect pests. This research proposed a novel method of mangrove-mediated synthesis of insecticidal silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using Suaeda maritima, acting as a reducing and stabilizing agent. AgNP were characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. S. maritima aqueous extract and mangrove-synthesized AgNP showed larvicidal and pupicidal toxicity against the dengue vector Aedes aegypti and the tobacco cutworm Spodoptera litura. In particular, LC50 of AgNP ranged from 8.668 (larva I) to 17.975 ppm (pupa) for A. aegypti, and from 20.937 (larva I) to 46.896 ppm (pupa) for S. litura. In the field, the application of S. maritima extract and AgNP (10 × LC50) led to 100% mosquito larval reduction after 72 h. Smoke toxicity experiments conducted on A. aegypti adults showed that S. maritima leaf-, stem- and root-based coils evoked mortality rates comparable or higher if compared to permethrin-based positive control (62%, 52%, 42%, and 50.2 respectively). In ovicidal experiments, egg hatchability was reduced by 100% after treatment with 20 ppm of AgNP and 250 ppm of S. maritima extract. Furthermore, low doses of the AgNP inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi.

The neonicotinoid, clothianidin represents a class of chemistry new to public health. Clothianidin acts as an agonist on nicotinic acetyl choline receptors. IRS with a mixture of Clothianidin and another WHO approved insecticide such as deltamethrin could provide improved control of insecticide resistant malaria vector populations and serve as a tool for insecticide resistance management. Methods The efficacy and residual activity of a novel IRS mixture of deltamethrin and clothianidin was evaluated against wild pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae sl in experimental huts in Cove, Benin. Two application rates of the mixture were tested and comparison was made with clothianidin and deltamethrin applied alone. To assess the residual efficacy of the treatments on different local wall substrates, the inner walls of the experimental huts were covered with either cement, mud or plywood. Results Clothianidin demonstrated a clear delayed expression in mortality of wild pyrethroid resistant An. gambiae sl in the experimental huts which reached its full effect 120 hours after exposure. Overall mortality over the 12-month hut trial was 15% in the control hut and 24–29% in the deltamethrin-treated huts. The mixture of clothianidin 200mg/m2 and deltamethrin 25mg/m2 induced high overall hut mortality rates (87% on mud walls, 82% on cement walls and 61% on wooden walls) largely due to the clothianidin component and high hut exiting rates (67–76%) mostly due to the deltamethrin component. Mortality rates remained &gt;80% for 8–9 months on mud and cement walls. The residual activity trend was confirmed by results from monthly in situ cone bioassays with laboratory susceptible An. gambiae Kisumu strain.

The mosquito control is still mainly performed by using insecticides but their effectiveness is increasingly questioned nowadays. We here conducted a study on Ae. aegypti resistance development towards several commonly used insecticides in the capital city of Jakarta, Indonesia. In order to achieve this goal, Ae. aegypti eggs from Jakarta were collected with ovitraps and hatched in the insectary of the Gadjah Mada University, Indonesia. The F0 generations were used for WHO resistance tests and knockdown resistance (kdr) assays. Presented results clearly showed that there was resistance development of Ae. aegypti populations to the here tested pyrethroid insecticides (i. e. permethrin). Observed mortalities were less than 90% with highest resistance against 0.75% permethrin concentrations. Furthermore, a significant association of V1016G gene mutations with resistance phenotypes to 0.75% permethrin was observed. Nevertheless, the F1534C mutation did not show a significant correlation to resistance development. In conclusion, our results show that populations of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes within the city of Jakarta have developed resistance against several routinely used pyrethroid insecticides in local performed control programs. Thus, the regular verification/assessment of resistance development status will hopefully help in the future to assist local public health authorities in their mosquito control programs by recommending and managing the rotation of different routinely used insecticides with diverse effector mechanisms in order to delay Ae. aegypti resistance development. © 2017 Hamid et al.

Combination LLINs are designed to control susceptible and pyrethroid-resistant mosquito populations through a mixture of pyrethroid with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) synergist. A cluster randomized trial with entomology outcome measures was conducted in Mali to determine the added benefit over mono-treated pyrethroid predecessors. Four LLIN treatments; permethrin + PBO, permethrin, deltamethrin + PBO, and deltamethrin, were randomly allocated to four villages each (16 villages total) and distributed to cover every sleeping place. Entomological monitoring of indoor Anopheles resting densities, host preference, vector longevity, and sporozoite rates were monitored every 2 months over 2 years in 2014 and 2015. Results: Bottle bioassays confirmed permethrin and deltamethrin resistance in Anopheles gambiae sensu lato (s.l.), (the predominant species throughout the study) with pre-exposure to PBO indicating partial involvement of oxidases. Between 2014 and 2015 the mean indoor resting density was greater in the deltamethrin + PBO LLIN arm than the deltamethrin LLIN arm at 3.05 (95% CI 3.00-3.10) An. gambiae s.l. per room per day compared with 1.9 (95% CI 1.87-1.97). There was no significant difference in sporozoite rate at 3.97% (95% CI 2.91-5.02) for the deltamethrin LLIN arm and 3.04% (95% CI 2.21-3.87) for deltamethrin + PBO LLIN arm (P = 0.17). However, when analysed by season there was some evidence that the sporozoite rate was lower in the deltamethrin + PBO LLIN arm than deltamethrin LLIN arm during the rainy/high malaria transmission seasons at 1.95% (95% CI 1.18-2.72) and 3.70% (95% CI 2.56-4.84) respectively (P = 0.01). Conclusions: While there was some evidence that An. gambiae s.l. sporozoite rates were lower in villages with deltamethrin + PBO LLINs during the high malaria transmission seasons of 2014-2015, there was no reduction in parity rates or indoor resting densities. There was also no evidence that permethrin + PBO LLINs provided any improved control when compared with permethrin LLINs. Combination nets may have a greater impact in areas where mixed function oxidases play a more important role in pyrethroid resistance. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

However, the development of insecticide resistance and its implications for operational failure of preventative strategies are of concern. The aim of this study was to characterize insecticide resistance among Anopheles arabiensis populations in Ethiopia and describe temporal and spatial patterns of resistance between 2012 and 2016. Methods: Between 2012 and 2016, resistance status of An. arabiensis was assessed annually during the long rainy seasons in study sites from seven of the nine regions in Ethiopia. Insecticide resistance levels were measured with WHO susceptibility tests and CDC bottle bioassays using insecticides from four chemical classes (organochlorines, pyrethroids, organophosphates and carbamates), with minor variations in insecticides tested and assays conducted between years. In selected sites, CDC synergist assays were performed by pre-exposing mosquitoes to piperonyl butoxide (PBO). In 2015 and 2016, mosquitoes from DDT and deltamethrin bioassays were randomly selected, identified to species-level and screened for knockdown resistance (kdr) by PCR. Results: Intense resistance to DDT and pyrethroids was pervasive across Ethiopia, consistent with historic use of DDT for IRS and concomitant increases in insecticide-treated net coverage over the last 15 years. Longitudinal resistance trends to malathion, bendiocarb, propoxur and pirimiphos-methyl corresponded to shifts in the national insecticide policy. By 2016, resistance to the latter two insecticides had emerged, with the potential to jeopardize future long-term effectiveness of vector control activities in these areas. Between 2015 and 2016, the West African (L1014F) kdr allele was detected in 74.1% (n = 686/926) of specimens, with frequencies ranging from 31 to 100% and 33 to 100% in survivors from DDT and deltamethrin bioassays, respectively. Restoration of mosquito susceptibility, following pre-exposure to PBO, along with a lack of association between kdr allele frequency and An. arabiensis mortality rate, both indicate metabolic and target-site mutation mechanisms are contributing to insecticide resistance. Conclusions: Data generated by this study will strengthen the National Malaria Control Programme's insecticide resistance management strategy to safeguard continued efficacy of IRS and other malaria control methods in Ethiopia. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

For the R. microplus field trials, 20 bovines were selected by counting the semi-engorged females, and the therapeutic and residual efficacy was evaluated by taking tick counts at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49 and 56 dpt. Forty bovines that were naturally infested with Dermatobia hominis larvae were selected, and the numbers of larvae were counted by visual and tactile inspection on 3, 7, 14, 28, 35, 42 and 49 dpt. To address the efficacy on C. hominivorax larvae, two circular skin incisions (one on each side of the body) measuring approximately 4 cm in diameter each were made in 12 crossbred calves, and the natural exposure of the lesions to C. hominivorax infestations was then allowed. The incisions from the 12 animals were carefully examined daily from 1 to 10 dpt. Based on the PK results obtained for this pour-on combination containing fipronil 1.25 mg/kg + fluazuron 2.5 mg/kg, the maximum concentrations (Cmax) and the half-lives (T1/2) of these two active ingredients were detected on days 2, 5/6 and 19 (± 2)/24, 4 (± 3.5) days for fipronil and fluazuron, respectively. Furthermore, the combination showed higher therapeutic and residual efficacy against R. microplus (P ≤ 0.05) when compared with commercial standalone formulations that were administered separately. A high efficacy for this new combination was also found against C. hominivorax and D. hominis larvae (efficacy ≥ 99%). This study's results show that the combination of these two active ingredients, as opposed to their separate use, could represent a tool for extending the life cycle of these two molecules against cattle ectoparasites, especially R. microplus. Further studies would be desirable to further confirm this. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2017,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","Cattle (Bos taurus)"

Flacio, L. Engeler, P. Müller, M.H.N.L. Silva-Filha","Insecticide susceptibility of Aedes albopictus and Ae. aegypti from Brazil and the Swiss-Italian border region","Background: Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus are two highly invasive mosquito species, both vectors of several viruses, including dengue, chikungunya and Zika. While Ae. aegypti is the primary vector in the tropics and sub-tropics, Ae. albopictus is increasingly under the public health watch as it has been implicated in arbovirus-transmission in more temperate regions, including continental Europe. Vector control using insecticides is the pillar of most control programmes; hence development of insecticide resistance is of great concern. As part of a Brazilian-Swiss Joint Research Programme we set out to assess whether there are any signs of existing or incipient insecticide resistance primarily against the larvicide Bacillus thuringiensis svar. israelensis (Bti), but also against currently applied and potentially alternative insecticides in our areas, Recife (Brazil) and the Swiss-Italian border region. Methods: Following World Health Organization guidelines, dose-response curves for a range of insecticides were established for both colonized and field caught Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The larvicides included Bti, two of its toxins, Cry11Aa and Cry4Ba, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Vectomax CG®, a formulated combination of Bti and L. sphaericus, and diflubenzuron. In addition to the larvicides, the Swiss-Italian Ae. albopictus populations were also tested against five adulticides (bendiocarb, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, malathion, permethrin and λ-cyhalothrin). Results: Showing a similar dose-response, all mosquito populations were fully susceptible to the larvicides tested and, in particular, to Bti which is currently used both in Brazil and Switzerland. In addition, there were no signs of incipient resistance against Bti as larvae were equally susceptible to the individual toxins, Cry11Aa and Cry4Ba. The field-caught Swiss-Italian populations were susceptible to the adulticides tested but DDT mortality rates showed signs of reduced susceptibility. Conclusions: The insecticides currently used for mosquito control in Switzerland and Brazil are still effective against the target populations. The present study provides an important reference as relatively few insecticide susceptibility surveys have been carried out with Ae. albopictus. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

Two types of leishmaniasis, viz. visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) are endemic in Iran. The main vector of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) is Phlebotomus sergenti. The aim of the present study was to determine the susceptibility status of wild strain of P. sergenti to different imagicides of DDT, bendiocarb and permethrin at the median lethal time, LT50 level. Methods: Sandflies were collected from selected village in North Khorasan Province, northeast of Iran from indoors using CDC light-traps. Susceptibility test was carried out against DDT (4%), bendiocarb (0.1%) and permethrin (0.75%) for all the females according to WHO method, and mortality was calculated. Species identification was carried out using the morphological keys. Data were analysed using probit regression analysis to determine the LT50 and LT90 values. Results: In total, 851 female P. sergenti sandflies were tested. LT50 values to DDT (4%), Bendiocarb (0.1%) and permethrin (0.75%) were 15.4, 19.2 and 6.3 min respectively. The values for LT90 were 51.1, 47.4 and 18.6 min respectively. The mortality rates for 1 h exposure time to DDT, bendiocarb and permethrin were 89.8 ± 1.4; 93.6 ± 1.4; and 95.6 ± 1.7%, respectively. Interpretation &amp; conclusion: The suscesptibility studies revealed development of resistance against DDT (4%) in the wild strain of P. sergenti population.

The In2Care® mosquito trap was recently developed to target and kill larval and adult stages of these invasive container-inhabiting Aedes mosquitoes by utilizing autodissemination. Gravid females that visit the trap pick up pyriproxyfen (PPF) that they later transfer to nearby larval habitats as well as Beauveria bassiana spores that slowly kill them. We assessed the efficacy of the In2Care mosquito trap in a semifield setting against locally sourced strains of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. We found that the In2Care mosquito trap is attractive to gravid Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus females and serves as an egg sink, preventing any adult emergence from the trap (P = 0.0053 for both species). Adult females successfully autodisseminated PPF to surrounding water-filled containers, leading to a statistically significant reduction in new mosquito emergence (P ≤ 0.0002 for both species). Additionally, we found effective contamination with Beauveria bassiana spores, which significantly reduced the survivorship of exposed Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus (P ≤ 0.008 for both species in all experimental setups). In summary, the In2Care mosquito trap successfully killed multiple life stages of 2 main mosquito vector species found in Florida under semifield conditions.

Insecticide resistance in malaria vectors has been detected in a few countries in the Greater Mekong sub-region (GMS), representing a threat to malaria control and prevention. This study aims to determine the insecticide resistance status of Anopheles mosquitoes in Ubon Ratchathani province, northeastern Thailand, where increasing number of malaria cases were reported recently. Methods: Mosquitoes were collected in 2013-2015 using human landing and cattle bait collections in six sites during both the rainy and dry seasons. Mosquitoes were first morphologically identified to species and their susceptibility status to deltamethrin (0.05%), permethrin (0.75%) and DDT (4%) investigated, according to WHO guidelines. Bioassays with the synergists PBO and DEF were carried out to address the role of detoxifying enzymes in insecticide resistance. DNA sequencing of a fragment of the voltage-gated sodium channel gene was carried out to detect knock-down resistance (kdr) substitutions at position 1014 in resistant species. Results: Due to low vector abundance, complete bioassays (n ≥ 100 mosquitoes) were only achieved for Anopheles hyrcanus s.l., which was resistant to all insecticides tested (mortality ranged from 45 to 87%). Suspected resistance to DDT was found in Anopheles barbirostris s.l. (mortality 69%), but it was susceptible to deltamethrin (mortality 97-100%) and permethrin (mortality 100%). Although insufficient number of primary vectors were collected, results showed that Anopheles dirus s.l. and Anopheles maculatus s.l. were susceptible to deltamethrin (mortality 100%). Anopheles nivipes and Anopheles philippinensis were susceptible to all three insecticides. PBO significantly increased mortality to deltamethrin and permethrin in pyrethroid-resistant An. hyrcanus s.l. None of the sequenced specimens presented the L1014F or L1014S mutation. Discussion: This study shows that insecticide resistance is present in potential malaria vectors in northeastern Thailand. The absence of kdr mutations in all Anopheles species tested suggests that metabolic resistance is the main mechanism of pyrethroid resistance. This study provides new findings about insecticide susceptibility status of potential malaria vectors in northeastern Thailand that are deemed important to guide malaria vector control. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

This study was conducted to determine the toxicity of the three lignans (-)-asarinin, sesamin and (+)-xanthoxylol-γ,γ-dimethylallylether (XDA), and the alkaloid pellitorine from Zanthoxylum piperitum (Rutaceae) bark to third-instar larvae from insecticide-susceptible C. pipiens pallens and Ae. aegypti as well as wild C. pipiens pallens resistant to deltamethrin, cyfluthrin, fenthion, and temephos. Methods: The toxicities of all isolates were compared with those of mosquito larvicide temephos. LC50 values for each species and their treatments were significantly different from one another when their 95% confidence intervals did not overlap. Results: XDA was isolated from Z. piperitum as a new larvicidal principle. XDA (LC50, 0.27 and 0.24 mg/l) was 4, 53, and 144 times and 4, 100, and 117 times more toxic than pellitorine, sesamin, and asarinin toward larvae from susceptible C. pipiens pallens and Ae. aegypti, respectively. Overall, all the isolates were less toxic than temephos (LC50, 0.006 and 0.009 mg/l). These constituents did not differ in toxicity to larvae from the two Culex strains. The present finding indicates that the lignans and alkaloid and the insecticides do not share a common mode of larvicidal action or elicit cross-resistance. Conclusion: Naturally occurring Z. piperitum bark-derived compounds, particularly XDA, merit further study as potential mosquito larval control agents or as lead compounds for the control of insecticide-resistant mosquito populations. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

We re-assessed the roles of Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus, and examined potential benefits of species-specific interventions in an area in southeastern Tanzania, where malaria transmission persists, four years after mass distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs). Monthly mosquito sampling was done in randomly selected households in three villages using CDC light traps and back-pack aspirators, between January-2015 and January-2016, four years after the last mass distribution of LLINs in 2011. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify members of An. funestus and Anopheles gambiae complexes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to detect Plasmodium sporozoites in mosquito salivary glands, and to identify sources of mosquito blood meals. WHO susceptibility assays were done on wild caught female An. funestus s.l, and physiological ages approximated by examining mosquito ovaries for parity. A total of 20,135 An. arabiensis and 4,759 An. funestus were collected. The An. funestus group consisted of 76.6% An. funestus s.s, 2.9% An. rivulorum, 7.1% An. leesoni, and 13.4% unamplified samples. Of all mosquitoes positive for Plasmodium, 82.6% were An. funestus s.s, 14.0% were An. arabiensis and 3.4% were An. rivulorum. An. funestus and An. arabiensis contributed 86.21% and 13.79% respectively, of annual entomological inoculation rate (EIR). An. arabiensis fed on humans (73.4%), cattle (22.0%), dogs (3.1%) and chicken (1.5%), but An. funestus fed exclusively on humans. The An. funestus populations were 100% susceptible to organophosphates, pirimiphos methyl and malathion, but resistant to permethrin (10.5% mortality), deltamethrin (18.7%), lambda-cyhalothrin (18.7%) and DDT (26.2%), and had reduced susceptibility to bendiocarb (95%) and propoxur (90.1%). Parity rate was higher in An. funestus (65.8%) than An. arabiensis (44.1%). Though An. arabiensis is still the most abundant vector species here, the remaining malaria transmission is predominantly mediated by An. funestus, possibly due to high insecticide resistance and high survival probabilities. Interventions that effectively target An. funestus mosquitoes could therefore significantly improve control of persistent malaria transmission in south-eastern Tanzania. © 2017 Kaindoa et al.

Synthetic acaricides are the primary method of control this thick. Resistance of R. microplus to synthetic acaricides has given rise to the need of new scientific investigations on alternative ways to control it. The objective of this work was to conduct a chemical investigation of Crescentia cujete L. fruit pulp and to evaluate the acaricide effect on R. microplus larvae of extracts, fractions, and isolated substances from this species. Crescentia cujete is a Bignoniaceae and it is characteristic of tropical climates. Its most distinctive feature is its fruit, which is spherical and gourd-like, with a hard woody shell and gelatinous pulp. The fruit pulp of C. cujete was extracted with ethanol by maceration yielding an extract and a residue. The extract was partitioned giving an ethyl acetate phase (EAF) that was fractionated by chromatographic procedures yielding cinnamic acid and benzoic acid. The remained botanic material from the ethanol extraction was further and successively extracted with ethyl ether and methanol under reflux. The acaricide effect of all extracts and fractions was evaluated against R. microplus using the larval packet test. The best result was observed for the EAF that caused 100% of mortality when a 10% solution was used and with LC50 of 5.9%. Cinnamic acid was also tested showing 63.0% of mortality with LC50 of 6.6% at the same concentrations and time of the experiment. The data obtained in this study provides information related to the chemical nature and the acaricide activity of the C. cujete epicarp that has not been previously reported.

Fluralaner, a recently introduced parasiticide, was evaluated as a mosquitocide in this study. On Ae. aegypti and An. gambiae fourth-instar larvae, fluralaner had 24-h LC50 (lethal concentration for 50% mortality) values of 1.8 ppb and 0.4 ppb, respectively. Following topical application to adult Ae. aegypti, fluralaner toxicity reached a plateau in about 3 days, with 1- and 3-day LD50 (lethal dose for 50% mortality) values of 1.3 ng/mg and 0.26 ng/mg, suggesting a slowly developing toxicity. Fipronil outperformed fluralaner by up to 100-fold in adult topical, glass contact, and feeding assays on Ae. aegypti. These data show that fluralaner does not have exceptional toxicity to mosquitoes in typical exposure paradigms. In electrophysiological recordings on Drosophila melanogaster larval central nervous system, the effectiveness of fluralaner for restoring nerve firing after gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) treatment, a measure of GABA antagonism, was similar in susceptible Oregon-R and cyclodiene-resistant rdl-1675 strains, with EC50 (half maximal effective concentration) values of 0.34 µM and 0.29 µM. Although this finding suggests low cross resistance in the presence of rdl, the moderate potency, low contact activity, and slow action of fluralaner argue against its use as an adult mosquitocide for vector control. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2017,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

The recent market introduction of chewable tablets containing the novel compounds, afoxolaner (NexGard™) and fluralaner (Bravecto™) enabled us to conduct a comparative efficacy study with respect to the ability of these three products to block transmission of E. canis by ticks to dogs. The speed of kill, immediate drop-off rate and anti-attachment efficacy of the respective products were also studied. Methods: The study was a blinded parallel group design, wherein 32 dogs were randomised into four different groups of eight dogs. Group 1 served as negative placebo control, group 2 and 3 were treated on Days 0, 28 and 56 with NexGard™ and Advantix®, respectively. Group 4 was dosed once on Day 0 with Bravecto™. For tick efficacy assessments 50 non-infected ticks were placed onto the dogs on Days 30, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77 and 84 and on animal tick counts were performed at 3 h, 6 h and 12 h after infestation. To evaluate the ability to block transmission of E. canis, each dog was challenged by releasing 80 adult E. canis-infected R. sanguineus ticks into their sleeping kennels on Days 31, 38, 45 and 52. The animals were monitored for clinical signs of monocytic ehrlichiosis (pyrexia and thrombocytopenia) and were tested for E. canis DNA by PCR and for specific antibodies using IFA. A dog was considered infected with E. canis if both PCR and IFA yielded positive test results up to Day 84. Results: Mean arithmetic tick counts on dogs treated with the Advantix® spot-on were significantly (P &lt; 0.0005) lower throughout the study as compared with the negative controls and was, with respect to the speed of kill and resulting onset of acaricidal efficacy, superior over NexGard™ and Bravecto™ at all time points in the 12 h period observed (3 h, 6 h and 12 h). None of the dogs treated with the Advantix® spot-on became infected with E. canis, whereas six out of eight untreated control dogs acquired the infection. Furthermore, E. canis infection was diagnosed in four out of eight dogs treated with NexGard™ and in two out of eight dogs treated with Bravecto™. Conclusions: The speed of kill of the two recently registered systemic compounds against R. sanguineus was not sufficiently fast to prevent transmission of E. canis and resulted in only low partial blocking and protection capacity while Advantix® effectively blocked transmission of E. canis to dogs in the challenge period and thus provided adequate protection for dogs against monocytic ehrlichiosis. © 2016 The Author(s).",2016,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","Dog (Canis lupus familiaris)"

The underlying mechanisms of insecticide resistance may be linked to the metabolism of insecticides by various cells, including oenocytes. Oenocytes are ectodermal cells responsible for lipid metabolism and detoxification. The goal of this study was to evaluate the sublethal effects of deltamethrin on survival, behavior, and oenocyte structure in the immature mosquitoes of insecticide-susceptible and resistant strains of A. aegypti. Fourth instar larvae (L4) of both strains were exposed to different concentrations of deltamethrin (i.e., 0.001, 0.003, 0.005, and 0.007 ppm). After exposure, L4 were subjected to behavioral bioassays. Insecticide effects on cell integrity after deltamethrin exposure (at 0.003 or 0.005 ppm) were assessed by processing pupal oenocytes for transmission electron microscopy or TUNEL reaction. The insecticide resistant L4 survived all the tested concentrations, whereas the 0.007-ppm deltamethrin concentration had lethal effects on susceptible L4. Susceptible L4 were lethargic and exhibited less swimming activity than unexposed larvae, whereas the resistant L4 were hyperexcited following exposure to 0.005 ppm deltamethrin. No sublethal effects and no significant cell death were observed in the oenocytes of either susceptible or resistant insects exposed to deltamethrin. The present study illustrated the different responses of susceptible and resistant strains of A. aegypti following exposure to sublethal concentration of deltamethrin, and demonstrated how the behavior of the immature stage of the two strains varied, as well as oenocyte structure following insecticide exposure. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2016,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

Mimpfoundi","Anopheles coluzzii larval habitat and insecticide resistance in the island area of Manoka, Cameroon","Background: The effectiveness of Long-Lasting Insecticidal Nets and Indoor Residual Spraying in malaria vector control is threatened by vector resistance to insecticides. Knowledge of mosquito habitats and patterns of insecticide resistance would facilitate the development of appropriate vector control strategies. Therefore, we investigated An. coluzzii larval habitats and resistance to insecticides in the Manoka rural island area compared with the Youpwe suburban inland area, in Douala VI and II districts respectively. Methods: Anopheline larvae and pupae were collected from open water bodies in December 2013 and April 2014 and reared until adult emergence. Two to four day old emerging females were morphologically identified as belonging to the An. gambiae complex and used for WHO susceptibility tests with 4 % DDT, 0.75 % permethrin, and 0.05 % deltamethrin, with or without piperonyl butoxide (PBO) synergist. Control and surviving specimens were identified down to the species using a PCR-RFLP method. Survivors were genotyped for kdr L1014 mutations using Hot Oligonucleotide Ligation Assay. Results: In both study sites, ponds, residual puddles, boats, and drains were identified as the major An. gambiae s.l. larval habitats. A total of 1397 females, including 784 specimens from Manoka and 613 from Youpwe, were used for resistance testing. The two mosquito populations displayed resistance to DDT, permethrin and deltamethrin, with variable mortality rates from 1 % to 90 %. The knock-down times were also significantly increased (at least 2.8 fold). Pre-exposure of mosquitoes to PBO did not impact on their mortality to DDT, conversely the mortality rates to permethrin and deltamethrin were significantly increased (7.56 ≤ X2 ≤ 48.63, df = 1, p &lt; 0.01), suggesting involvement of P450 oxidases in pyrethroid resistance. A subsample of 400 An. gambiae s.l. specimens including 280 control and 120 survivors from bioassays were all found to be An. coluzzii species. Only the kdr 1014 F mutation was found in survivors, with 88.5 % (N = 76) and 75 % (N = 44) frequencies in Youpwe and Manoka respectively. Conclusion: This is the first report of An. coluzzii resistance to insecticides in an insular area in Cameroon. Since permanent larval habitats have been identified, larval source management strategies may be trialed in this area as complementary vector control interventions. © 2016 Etang et al.",2016,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

Personal protection technologies such as insecticide-treated clothing could provide individual protection. Here we assessed the efficacy of permethrin-treated clothing on personal protection in the laboratory. Methods The effect of washing on treated clothing, skin coverage and protection against resistant and susceptible Ae. aegypti was assessed using modified WHO arm-in-cage assays. Coverage was further assessed using free-flight room tests to investigate the protective efficacy of unwashed factory-dipped permethrin-treated clothing. Clothing was worn as full coverage (long sleeves and trousers) and partial coverage (short sleeves and shorts). Residual permethrin on the skin and its effect on mosquitoes was measured using modified WHO cone assays and quantified using high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Results In the arm-in-cage assays, unwashed clothing reduced landing by 58.9% (95% CI 49.2-66.9) and biting by 28.5% (95% CI 22.5-34.0), but reduced to 18.5% (95% CI 14.7-22.3) and 11.1% (95% CI 8.5-13.8) respectively after 10 washes. Landing and biting for resistant and susceptible strains was not significantly different (p&lt;0.05). In free-flight room tests, full coverage treated clothing reduced landing by 24.3% (95% CI 17.4-31.7) and biting by 91% (95% CI 82.2-95.9) with partial coverage reducing landing and biting by 26.4% (95% CI 20.3-31.2) and 49.3% (95% CI 42.1-59.1) respectively with coverage type having no significant difference on landing (p&lt;0.05). Residual permethrin was present on the skin in low amounts (0.0041mg/cm2 ), but still produced a KD of &gt;80% one hour after wearing treated clothing. Conclusion Whilst partially covering the body with permethrin-treated clothing provided some protection against biting, wearing treated clothing with long sleeves and trousers provided the highest form of protection. Washing treated clothing dramatically reduced protection provided. Permethrin-treated clothing could provide protection to individuals from Ae. aegypti that show permethrin resistance.

This disease appears to be hyperendemic but no substantial entomological data, including data on Anopheles spp. susceptibility to insecticides, is available. This study evaluates, for the first time in the CAR, the status of insecticide resistance in the Anopheles funestus population, the second major vector of malaria in Africa. Methods: WHO standard bioassay susceptibility tests were performed on the An. funestus population using F1 generation from gravid females mosquitoes (F0) collected by manual aspirator sampling of households in Gbanikola, Bangui in October 2014 to assess: (i) An. funestus susceptibility to bendiocarb, malathion, permethrin, lamda-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin and DDT, and (ii) the effect of pre-exposure to the piperonyl butoxide (PBO) synergist on insecticide susceptibility. Additional tests were conducted to investigate metabolic resistance status (cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, glutathione S-transferases, and esterases). Results: A high phenotypic resistance of An. funestus population to malathion, DDT and pyrethroids was observed with a mortality rate ranging from 23 to 74 %. For the pyrethroid groups, the mortality rate was 35, 31 and 23 % for lambda-cyhalothrin, deltamethrin, and permethrin, respectively. In contrast a 100 % mortality rate to bendiocarb was recorded. Knockdown time (KDT) was long for all pyrethroids, DDT and malathion with KDT50 higher than 50 min. Pre-exposure of An. funestus to PBO synergist significantly restored susceptibility to all pyrethroids (Fisher's exact test P &lt;0.0001) but not in DDT (Fisher's exact test P = 0.724). Data from biochemical tests suggest the involvement of cytochrome P450 monooxygenases, esterases and glutatione S-transferases in the resistance of An. funestus population from Gbanikola (Wilcoxon test P &lt;0.05). Conclusion: Evidence of biochemical resistance to insecticide was detected in An. funestus population from the district of Gbanikola, Bangui. This study suggests that detoxifying enzymes are involved in insecticide resistance of An. funestus. However, despite disruptive violence, further research is urgently needed to assess the insecticide susceptibility status of An. funestus population in all CAR regions; insecticide resistance could rapidly compromise the success of malaria control programs. © 2016 Olé Sangba et al.",2016,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

Bernhardt","Diagnostic doses and times for Phlebotomus papatasi and Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) using the CDC bottle bioassay to assess insecticide resistance","Background: Insecticide resistance to synthetic chemical insecticides is a worldwide concern in phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae), the vectors of Leishmania spp. parasites. The CDC bottle bioassay assesses resistance by testing populations against verified diagnostic doses and diagnostic times for an insecticide, but the assay has been used limitedly with sand flies. The objective of this study was to determine diagnostic doses and diagnostic times for laboratory Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Nieva) and Phlebotomus papatasi (Scopoli) to ten insecticides, including pyrethroids, organophosphates, carbamates, and DDT, that are used worldwide to control vectors. Methods: Bioassays were conducted in 1,000-ml glass bottles each containing 10-25 sand flies from laboratory colonies of L. longipalpis or P. papatasi. Four pyrethroids, three organophosphates, two carbamates and one organochlorine, were evaluated. A series of concentrations were tested for each insecticide, and four replicates were conducted for each concentration. Diagnostic doses were determined only during the exposure bioassay for the organophosphates and carbamates. For the pyrethroids and DDT, diagnostic doses were determined for both the exposure bioassay and after a 24-hour recovery period. Results: Both species are highly susceptible to the carbamates as their diagnostic doses are under 7.0 μg/ml. Both species are also highly susceptible to DDT during the exposure assay as their diagnostic doses are 7.5 μg/ml, yet their diagnostic doses for the 24-h recovery period are 650.0 μg/ml for Lu. longipalpis and 470.0 μg/ml for P. papatasi. Conclusions: Diagnostic doses and diagnostic times can now be incorporated into vector management programs that use the CDC bottle bioassay to assess insecticide resistance in field populations of Lu. longipalpis and P. papatasi. These findings provide initial starting points for determining diagnostic doses and diagnostic times for other sand fly vector species and wild populations using the CDC bottle bioassay. © 2016 Denlinger et al.",2016,Fernanda.dorea,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","NOT HOST SPECIFIC"

Scott","Injectable fipronil for cattle: Plasma disposition and efficacy against Rhipicephalus microplus","Fipronil is a phenylpyrazole class insecticide. It is widely used as an insecticide in agriculture and in the control of ectoparasites in veterinary medicine. The application of fipronil in an injectable form (subcutaneously) becomes an innovation, since there is no commercially available preparation containing fipronil herein. The present study aimed at fipronil usage, applied subcutaneously in cattle, to control Rhipicephalus microplus. The assessing criteria used in the research have been the construction of the plasma concentration curve and efficacy studies. A method using High Performance Liquid Chromatograph with ultraviolet detection was developed for determination of fipronil in bovine plasma samples, providing a fast and simple process with good reproducibility and low limit of quantification. The validation of the analytical method showed linearity, selectivity, precision, accuracy, sensitivity and stability, thus proving it as suitable for routine analysis. This method showed to be an important investigative tool in the analysis of fipronil plasma concentration in cattle. Fipronil administered via subcutaneous in bovine reached the systemic circulation (Cmax = 378.06 ± 137.44 ng/mL), was quickly absorbed (tmax = 10 ± 0.87 h), and its elimination occurred slowly (t1/2 = 12 days), while maintaining quantifiable blood plasma levels (23.79 ± 12.16 ng/mL) for up to 21 days after the treatment with a 1 mg/kg dosage. The in vivo efficacy tests proved that fipronil applied subcutaneously in a single dose of 1 mg/kg in cattle exhibited a mean efficacy of 82.41% against R. microplus. The potential of subcutaneous injection as an alternative treatment route in cattle encourage the development of an injectable formulation of fipronil. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2016,mia.holmberg,4,"Not applicable (vector study)","Cattle (Bos taurus)"

Eco-friendly control tools against malaria vectors are urgently needed. This research proposed a novel method of plant-mediated synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using a cheap seaweed extract of Ulva lactuca, acting as a reducing and capping agent. AgNP were characterized by UV–vis spectrophotometry, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The U. lactuca extract and the green-synthesized AgNP were tested against larvae and pupae of the malaria vector Anopheles stephensi. In mosquitocidal assays, LC50 values of U. lactuca extract against A. stephensi larvae and pupae were 18.365 ppm (I instar), 23.948 ppm (II), 29.701 ppm (III), 37.517 ppm (IV), and 43.012 ppm (pupae). LC50 values of AgNP against A. stephensi were 2.111 ppm (I), 3.090 ppm (II), 4.629 ppm (III), 5.261 ppm (IV), and 6.860 ppm (pupae). Smoke toxicity experiments conducted against mosquito adults showed that U. lactuca coils evoked mortality rates comparable to the permethrin-based positive control (66, 51, and 41 %, respectively). Furthermore, the antiplasmodial activity of U. lactuca extract and U. lactuca-synthesized AgNP was evaluated against CQ-resistant (CQ-r) and CQ-sensitive (CQ-s) strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Fifty percent inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of U. lactuca were 57.26 μg/ml (CQ-s) and 66.36 μg/ml (CQ-r); U. lactuca-synthesized AgNP IC50 values were 76.33 μg/ml (CQ-s) and 79.13 μg/ml (CQ-r). Overall, our results highlighted out that U. lactuca-synthesized AgNP may be employed to develop newer and safer agents for malaria control. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2015,mia.holmberg,4,"Not applicable (vector study)",Humans
