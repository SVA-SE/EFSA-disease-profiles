The antibody-titration cell cultures were examined for cytopathic effect over a period of 10 to 12 days and the titres were expressed as log 2 tissue culture infective dose (TCID50). To compare the end-point titres of sera examined by the VNT and the competitive ELISA, serial twofold dilutions, from 1:8 to 1:1024, were tested, The sera were added in duplicate to coated competitive ELISA plates, and the test was performed as described above.

The 244 negative sera samples from SPF chicken were used to determine the cut-off value and define positive and negative sera samples. All sera were detected with the cELISA, and the cut-off value was set at the mean PI of 244 negative serum samples plus 3 standard deviations (SD) to ensure 99% confidence for the negative sera samples within this range.","Based on the nanobody-HRP fusion protein, the cELISA was firstly designed. First, the optimal amount of coating antigen and dilution of selected nanobody-HRP fusions for the cELISA were determined using a checkerboard titration with direct ELISA. Different amounts of the coating antigen included 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 ng/well, and the dilution ratios of nanobody-HRP fusions were 1:1, 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10,000. The final conditions were determined from the reaction that produced approximately 1.0 of OD450nm values in the direct ELISA.

The dilution of the tested chicken sera was also optimized. Four separate positive and negative chicken sera for anti-NDV IgG antibodies were diluted with 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640, and 1:1280 for cELISA testing. The optimal amount of coated antigen and dilution of nanobody-HRP fusions were used. Then, the optimal serum dilution was determined when the smallest ratio of OD450nm values between the positive and negative serum (P/N) were obtained.

The competition times of between testing sera antibody and nanobody-HRP fusions with antigen and colorimetric reaction were also optimised. The incubation times of the mixtures containing the nanobody-HRP fusions and the positive or negative sera with coated antigen were tested for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 min. After TMB was added into the plates, 10 and 15 min were selected as the colorimetric reaction times. Using a checkerboard titration, the two optimal times were determined as those when the smallest ratio of P/N was obtained.

After optimising the above conditions, the 96-well ELISA plates were coated with the optimal amount of NDV-NP recombinant protein in the PBS (pH 7.2) buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C or for 1 h at RT. Then, the plates were blocked with blocking buffer at RT for 1 h. After washed with PBS’T, the wells were added into 100 μL of testing mixtures containing the optimal dilutions of serum sample and nanobody-HRP fusions in the blocking buffer then incubated for optimal times at RT. After washed three times again, 100 μL TMB was added into each well, which were then incubated for optimal times at RT. As a final step, 3 M H2SO4 (50 μL/well) was used to stop the colorimetric reaction, and the OD450nm values were read by an automated ELISA plate reader.","Cut-off = 18%",-1,723,355,368,360,363,100,98.6,,,,,,,

To minimise the risk of cross-contamination, we maintained a strict regime for the use of material and laboratories. Preparation of the field samples was carried out in a pre-PCR laboratory. For RT-PCR, three different laboratories were used. Laboratory 1 was used to prepare buffers, and for the storage of stock and working solutions of primers, probes, and PCR kits. Laboratory 2 was used for RNA isolation and to mix reagents for the RT-PCR with the template by adding them to the LightCycler capillaries. The LightCycler thermal cycler was located in laboratory 3. Disposable gloves were worn in all three laboratories, and routing from laboratory 1 to 3 was made obligatory for samples as well as for staff. In the sample preparation laboratory, samples were handled in laminar flow cabinets, using sterile equipment (mortar and pestle, sand, scissors and pairs of tweezers).

The beads were thoroughly mixed, and the slide was incubated for 1 to 10 min on a rocking shaker with gentle agitation. The key to good agglutination reactions appeared to be side-to-side movement of the reaction solution across the slide. Beads coated with the negative IgG were mixed with the positive test solution as a negative control, while beads coated with anti-M. capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae IgG were also mixed with antigen-free test solution (negative goat serum or ME growth medium) to test for autoagglutination. Agglutination (when seen against a dark background) was most obvious when the reaction mixture was still wet, although it could still be clearly ascertained when it was dry in the case of strong positive reactions. In borderline cases, increasing the reaction time by adding distilled H2O (10 to 15 μl) after 10 to 15 min or by conducting the reaction in a humid atmosphere to prevent desiccation of the mixture was found to be beneficial.

Four micrometer–thick tissue sections were cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues and mounted on positively charged microscope slides.h Immunohistochemical labeling was performed manually following previously described methods.23 Briefly, the standard immunoperoxidase method included routine deparaffinizing with 2 changes of xylene, rehydration through graded alcohol baths to distilled water, and incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide. This was followed by heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) or enzymatic digestion (Table 2), followed by blocking of nonspecific epitopes and incubation with the primary antibody. The avidin–biotin complex (ABC) immunoperoxidase detection system was used to detect target antigens in sections treated with anti-RVFV, anti–BHV-1, and anti–EHV-1 serum. Sections were sequentially incubated with the secondary antibody and the peroxidase-conjugated avidin. To visualize WBV antigen, a polymer detection system was used.i Following incubation with the primary antibody, sections were incubated with the Novolink polymer. For the purpose of contrasting the brownish tissue pigments (especially bile, lipofuscin, or hemosiderin in liver sections) all sections were immersed in a NovaRED substrate.j Sections were then counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin, routinely dehydrated through increasing alcohol concentrations and xylol, mounted using entellan, and coverslipped.

Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) were obtained from our laboratory. Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) genome was a kind gift from professor Shaobin Shang at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University (Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China). The ASFV genome (GenBank accession number MH766894) was a kind gift from professor Rongliang Hu (Institute of Military Veterinary Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun, China). DNA was extracted by a FastPure Cell/Tissue DNA Isolation Mini Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). Total RNA was extracted with a FastPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). Reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was conducted using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) following the manufacturer's instruction. To avoid template degradation, eluted nucleic acid was appropriately diluted, aliquoted and stored in −70°C freezer.


The real-time PCR assay was developed and validated using the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and TaKaRa TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). With other factors constant, the concentration of primers and annealing temperature were optimized to make the method more specific and sensitive (20). Four concentrations of the primer: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 μM and four different annealing temperatures: 56, 58, 60, 62°C were used in the experiment. According to the results, the optimum conditions were determined.","The forward primer A137R-F (5′-GGACATCGAGTGGTATTAAAAGG-3′, nt 250–272) and the reverse primer A137R-R (5′-TGGCCTGAAAGTCAACATTGA-3′, nt 326–346) were designed based on the alignment of 100 complete coding sequences (CDS) of the ASFV A137R gene available in the GenBank database (The Genbank accession numbers are shown in Figure 1). The sequences were analyzed using MegAlign and Protean software, version 7.1.0 (DNAstar). The primers were chosen in highly conserved regions of the targeted sequences, and the expected size of the real-time PCR product was 97 bp. The primers A137R-F/A137R-R corresponded to sites that were more conserved than those used in the OIE-recommended TaqMan PCR method (19) (Figure 1). To genotype ASFV in the samples that were positive in the developed assay, the forward primer B646L-F (5′-ATGGCATCAGGAGGAGCTTTTTG-3′, nt 1–23) and the reverse primer B646L-R (5′-TTAGGTACTGTAACGCAGCACAGC-3′, nt 1918–1941) were designed and used for automated dideoxynucleotide cycle sequencing of the B646L (p72) gene.

After incubation overnight at 4 °C, the wells were washed thrice with washing buffer (0.2xPBS) containing 0.1 % Tween 20 = 0.2xPBS-T), followed by blocking with 150 μL blocking buffer [1x PBS-T containing 5% Skim-milk powder (HiMedia Laboratories, India) and 3% Lactalbumin hydrolysate (LAH, Sigma-Aldrich, USA)]. After incubation (at 37 °C for 1 h) and 3 times washing of the plate, 50 μL of dilution buffer (1xPBS-T + 1% chicken serum (HiMedia Laboratories, India), 25 μL of 1:3 diluted serum (25 μL of serum in 75 μL of 1xPBS), and 75 μL of diluted (1:30000) GPS-rPPRV-NPN as competitive antibodies were added along with other controls panel (negative, positive, and conjugate) were analyzed and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. The test sera along with standard positive and negative sera were tested in duplicate wells. The anti-guinea pig–IgG Biotin conjugate (Bethyl Laboratorries, Inc, USA) at 1:20000 dilution was added (100 μL/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Then after 3 times washing, Streptavidin hydrogen peroxidase conjugate (Thermo Scientific, USA) in dilution buffer (1:20000) was added (100 μL/well) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing, ready-to-use Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Invitrosense, Pvt. Ltd.
