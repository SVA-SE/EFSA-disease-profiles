This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the commercial recombinant turkey herpes virus-H5 (rHVT-H5) vaccine (clade 2.2), alone or in combination with commercial inactivated reverse genetically engineered H5N1 vaccine (rgH5N1) (clade 2.2), in preventing the genetically distinct HPAI H5N8 virus of clade 2.3.4.4b in commercial broiler chickens. Four experimental groups of chickens were used as follows: G1, non-vaccinated and non-challenged; G2, non-vaccinated and challenged; G3, vaccinated with rHVT-H5; and G4, prime–boost vaccinated with rHVT-H5/rgH5N1. For challenge with the Egyptian HPAI H5N8 (2.3.4.4b) virus, the groups were divided into two subgroups (A and B); chickens in subgroups A were challenged at the age of 28 days, whereas those in subgroups B were challenged at the age of 35 days. Results showed that a protective efficacy (survival rate) of 40%–50% was obtained in the vaccinated subgroups A. By delaying challenge for 1 week (subgroups B), a single rHVT-H5 vaccination provided 80% protection, whereas prime–boost vaccination induced full protection and reduced viral shedding very efficiently (1/10 birds and only detected on the 3rd day post challenge) against HPAI H5N8 virus (2.3.4.4b). Moreover, body weight loss improved from 31.39% and 43.65% in G3A and G4A, respectively, to 16.34% and 7.7% in G3B and G4B, respectively. The HI titers obtained in G3A and G4A on the challenge day (28th d) using H5N8 antigen were 3 and 3.75 log2 (p &gt; 0.05), respectively, whereas those in G3B and G4B on the challenge day (35th d) were 6.25 and 6 log2 (p &gt; 0.05), respectively, which increased post-challenge in all vaccinated subgroups. Therefore, the dual use of vectored rHVT-H5 and inactivated rgH5N1 vaccines in the vaccination schedule in poultry farms is the most efficient tool for preventing the disease (mortality and viral shedding) caused by the genetically distinct virus (clade 2.3.3.4b HPAI H5N8) in combination with strict biosecurity and sanitary measures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,e.royall,4,"HPAI - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza","Chickens (Gallus)"

This study aimed to prepare inactivated vaccine from recently isolated field strains [highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) (H5N8) and low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) (H9N2)] and compare the efficiency of the two experimental avian influenza vaccines and some commercial avian influenza H5 and H9N2 vaccines in laying hens. The obtained results indicated that the identified experimental vaccines (H5N8 and H9N2) were protected the flocks from AI as compared to commercial H5N1, H5N3, and H9N2 vaccines, which showed a protection level of 80, 70, and 90%, respectively, indicating a high efficacy for the developed vaccines. In addition, it significantly improved the virus shedding, especially when used in booster dose. The experimental vaccines were given high antibody titer higher than commercial vaccine which was reached to 9.3 log2, 9.7log2 for experimental H5N8 vaccine which was significantly higher than and groups 3 and 4 especially at 2nd WPV, while at the 3rd WPV, the significant difference was with group 4 only. The HI titer was 9.3 log2 at 2nd WPV for the experimental H9N2 vaccine that was significantly higher than group 9. In conclusion, the booster dose of the experimental vaccines could elicit strong immunity than single-dose and commercial vaccines. © 2021",2021,e.royall,4,"HPAI - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza","Chickens (Gallus)"

This study assessed the protection efficacy and virus shedding reduction of three different inactivated avian influenza (AI) H5 (H5N1, H5N2, and H5N3) commercial vaccines against challenge with two newly emerging highly pathogenic AI virus H5N8 Egyptian isolates in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks. Materials and Methods: 10-day-old SPF chicks (n=260) were divided into 20 groups (n=13). Groups 1-5 were vaccinated through the subcutaneous route (S/C) with 0.5 mL of H5N1 vaccine, Groups 6-10 were vaccinated (S/C) with 0.5 mL of H5N2 vaccine, and Groups 11-15 were vaccinated (S/C) with 0.5 mL of H5N3 vaccine. Positive control groups (16-19) were challenged at 25 and 31 days old (2 and 3 weeks post-vaccination [PV]) using H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 A/duck/Egypt/F13666A/2017(H5N8) and H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 A/chicken/Egypt/18FL6/2018(H5N8). Group 20 was left non-vaccinated as a control. All vaccinated groups were divided and challenged with both viruses at 25 and 31 days of age. The viral challenge dose was 0.1 mL of 106 EID50/0.1 mL titer/chick, and it was administered oronasally. All chicks were kept in isolators for 14 days after each challenge. Sera samples were collected weekly and at 2 weeks post-challenge (PC) to detect a humoral immune response. PC mortalities were recorded daily for 10 days to calculate the protection percentages. Tracheal swabs were collected from the challenged chicks in different groups at 3, 5, 7, and 10 days PC. Kidneys and spleens were collected at 3, 5, 7, and 10 days PC and kept in formalin for histopathological examination to assess lesions and severity scores. Tracheal swabs were inoculated in 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs for virus titration and to calculate shedding levels. Results: All studied vaccines displayed 70-100% protection within 10 days PC. Hemagglutination inhibition results from sera samples revealed antibody titers ranging from 0.6 to 5.4 log2 starting at 1-week PV with the highest titers at 4 weeks PV. Challenged SPF chickens exhibited a notable reduction in virus shedding, with an average of 1.5-2 log10, compared to control birds. Various histopathological lesions with different scores were detected. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the inadequate virus shedding reduction and protection efficacy of studied vaccines were variable and that the type of vaccine to be used under field conditions should be reconsidered. Study of the variability between the Egyptian old emerged AI (AIV) 2017 H5N8 strains and the new emerging AIV 2018 H5N8 is required to achieve optimal protection and limit the current economic losses.

While clade 2.2.2 and 2.3.4.2 HPAIVs have not been detected since 2012, clade 2.3.2.1a viruses have caused continuous outbreaks since 2012 despite the use of vaccines. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of two H5 vaccines licensed in Bangladesh, RE-6 inactivated vaccine, and a recombinant herpesvirus of turkeys vaccine with an H5 insert (rHVT-H5), for protection against recent field viruses in chickens. We selected three viruses for efficacy tests (A/chicken/Bangladesh/NRL-AI-3237/2017, A/crow/Bangladesh/NRL-AI-8471/2017 and A/chicken/Bangladesh/NRL-AI-8323/2017) from 36 H5 viruses isolated from Bangladesh between 2016 and 2018 by comparing the amino acid sequences at five antigenic sites (A-E) and analyzing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers with reference antisera. The RE-6 and rHVT-H5 vaccines both conferred 80–100% clinical protection (i.e. reduced morbidity and mortality) against the three challenge viruses with no significant differences in protection. In addition, both vaccines significantly decreased viral shedding from infected chickens as compared to challenge control chickens. Based on these metrics, the current licensed H5 vaccines protected chickens against the recent field viruses. However, the A/crow/Bangladesh/NRL-AI-8471/2017 virus exhibited antigenic divergence including: several unique amino acid changes in antigenic epitope sites A and B and was a serological outlier in cross HI tests as visualized on the antigenic map. The continuing emergence of such antigenic variants which could alter the dominant antigenicity of field viruses should be continuously monitored and vaccines should be updated if field efficacy declines. © 2021",2021,seungeun.han,4,"HPAI - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza","Chickens (Gallus)"

One of the inactivated vaccines and the RP vaccine were prepared with A/turkey/IN/16-01571-6/2016 H7N8 low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV; TK/IN/16), which is identical to the challenge virus, except for the proteolytic cleavage site of the hemagglutinin protein. The remaining three inactivated vaccines were prepared with other North American H7 LPAIVs. The hemagglutination inhibition assay was used to evaluate the antigenic relationships among the vaccines and selected recent H7 AIV isolates. All five vaccines provided protection against mortality. The inactivated vaccines reduced virus shedding significantly at 2 and 4 days post challenge compared with sham-vaccinated chickens. In contrast, the RP vaccine did not significantly reduce virus shedding. The inactivated vaccine prepared with TK/IN/16 elicited the highest antibody responses, which suggests it is a strong candidate for use as an antigen for North American H7 AIVs. Antigenic distance calculations showed that the four inactivated vaccine strains and other recent North American H7 isolates are antigenically similar, which suggests that the vaccines evaluated here would be similar enough to provide protection to other North American H7 AIVs. If future H7 outbreaks in poultry warrant vaccination, the field strain can be rapidly evaluated with these antigens and, if adequately related, one of these characterized strains may be used. © 2021 American Association of Avian Pathologists.

In this study, four H5N6 virus strains were isolated from faecal samples of sick white ducks and dead chickens in Shandong in 2019. These H5N6 viruses were triple-reassortant viruses that have not been previously characterized. Their HA genes were derived from the H5 viruses and were closely related to the vaccine strain Re-11. Their NA genes all fell into the N6-like lineage and the internal gene were derived from H5N1 and H9N2 viruses. They all showed high pathogenicity in mice and caused lethal infection with high rates of transmission in chickens. Moreover, the SPF chickens inoculated with the currently used H5 (Re-11 and Re-12 strains)/H7 (H7-Re-2 strain) trivalent inactivated vaccines in China were completely protected from these four H5N6 viruses.

Given the practical field constraints associated with administering two vaccines separately and in the absence of a currently available bivalent rHVT vector vaccine expressing both F(ND) and H5(AI) antigens, the aim of this study was to investigate whether interference occurs between the two vaccines when simultaneously administered in a single shot. The studies have been designed to determine (i) the ND and AI-specific protection and antibody response conferred by these vaccines inoculated alone or in combination at day-old, (ii) the influence of maternally-derived antibodies (MDA), and (iii) the potential interference between the two vaccine. Our results demonstrate that their combined administration is efficient to protect chickens against clinical signs of velogenic Newcastle disease virus (vNDV) and H5-highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infections. Viral shedding following co-vaccination is also markedly reduced, while slightly lower NDV-and AIV-specific antibody responses are observed. NDV-and AIV-specific MDA show negative effects on the onset of the specific antibody responses. However, if AIV-specific MDA reduce the protection against H5-HPAIV induced by rHVT-H5(AI) vaccine, it was not observed for ND. © 2020 by the authors.

The objective of the study presented in this paper was to test the efficacy of the commercially available HVT-based recombinant H5 vaccine against antigenically drifted H5N1, H5N8 and H5N2 HPAI virus circulating in Egypt recently. Groups of SPF chicks vaccinated at day-old with the HVT-based recombinant H5 vaccine were challenged, along with non-vaccinated controls, with 106 EID50 each of H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8 HPAI virus at 28 days of age. The animals were monitored for clinical protection and virus shedding during a 10 days post-challenge period. Clinical protection was 90%, 90% and 80% following challenge with the H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8 field isolates, respectively. Challenge virus shedding was significantly reduced in vaccinated groups, with up to 40%, 30% and 20% of non-shedders and 3.8, 3.3 and 2.8 log10 reduction in the amount of excreted virus following challenge with H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8 viruses, respectively. Analyses of the amino acid sequences of the HA proteins of challenge viruses and serological relatedness with the vaccine insert revealed significant antigenic divergences between the vaccine and the challenge viruses.

As part of a long-term, 36-week study, chickens were challenged at seven weeks of age after receiving a single vaccination, at 18 weeks of age following a vaccine prime-single boost, and at 36 weeks of age after a prime- double-boost. All vaccine programmes reduced virus oropharyngeal and cloacal shedding and mortality compared to the non-vaccinated control birds; however, chickens receiving at least one administration of the RP vaccine generally had diminished viral shedding especially from the cloacal swabbings. A detectable serum antibody response and protection were observed through 18 weeks post-vaccination. Our data suggest that, in conjunction with a comprehensive eradication, enhanced biosecurity and controlled marketing plan, vaccination programmes of commercial layer chickens with novel RP vaccines may represent an important tool for preventing HPAI-related mortalities and decreasing viral load during a catastrophic influenza outbreak. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS Immunization of poultry following a vaccination schedule consisting of inactivated and RNA particle vaccines offered significant protection against lethal disease following HPAIV challenge. Virus shedding was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced in chickens vaccinated with either inactivated and/or recombinant vaccines. Serum antibody titres were not a reliable indicator of protection.

Here, a recombinant subunit commercial H5 vaccine prepared from the clade 2.3.2 H5 segment on baculovirus was evaluated in Pekin ducks (Anasplatyrhynchos domesticus) and Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) in Biosafety Level 3 isolators by using two vaccination regimes: either a single dose on day 10 and a challenge on day 31 or a double dose on days 10 and 28 and a challenge on day 49. The protection parameters were evaluated after experimental infection with the Egyptian HPAI H5N8 isolate clade 2.3.4.4b (A/common-coot/Egypt/CA285/2016) based on mortality rate, clinical signs, gross lesions, seroconversion, virus shedding, and histopathologic changes. In the single-dose vaccination regime, the mortality rate in Muscovy and Pekin ducks was 10% and 0% vs. 40% and 0% in nonvaccinated challenged ducks, respectively. In the double-dose vaccination regime, the mortality rates in Muscovy and Pekin ducks were 0% and 0% vs. 60% and 40% in nonvaccinated challenged ducks, respectively. Muscovy ducks developed more severe clinical signs and gross lesions than Pekin ducks. In addition, tracheal viral shedding in challenged Muscovy ducks, in the single-dose vaccination regime, was 50%, 22%, and 0% at 3, 5, and 7 days postchallenge (DPC), respectively, and was 0% in all Pekin ducks vs. 100% in all challenged nonvaccinated Muscovy and Pekin ducks at 3, 5, and 7 DPC. The viral shedding in challenged Muscovy and Pekin ducks, in the double-dose vaccination regime, was 0% at 3, 5, and 7 DPC vs. 100% in nonvaccinated challenged Muscovy and Pekin ducks, respectively. The results of this study indicate that the H5 baculovirus-based vaccine can be used in ducks with better vaccination regime based on double-dose vaccination at 10 and 28 days of age. In addition, they highlight the need to evaluate the efficacy of currently used commercial vaccines against challenge with the newly emerged HPAI H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 in the field in Egypt to ensure proper control strategy in ducks. Eficacia de una vacuna desarrollada con un baculovirus recombinante subtipo H5 clado 2.3.2 en la protección de patos reales y Pekín contra la infección con virus de la influenza aviar de alta patogenicidad subtipo H5N8, clado 2.3.4.4. A finales del año 2016, se reportó en aves migratorias en Egipto la presencia del virus de la influenza aviar de alta patogenicidad subtipo H5N8, clado 2.3.4.4. Posteriormente, el virus se propagó en aves de traspatio y comerciales de varias provincias egipcias, causando graves pérdidas económicas a la industria avícola. En este trabajo, una vacuna subunitaria recombinante comercial con el subtipo H5 preparada a partir del segmento H5 del clado 2.3.2 expresado en baculovirus se evaluó en patos de Pekín y reales en unidades de aislamiento con nivel de bioseguridad 3 utilizando dos esquemas de vacunación: una dosis única en el día 10 y un desafío el día 31; o un esquema con doble dosis en los días 10 y 28 y con un desafío en el día 49. Los parámetros de protección se evaluaron después de la infección experimental con el aislamiento del virus de alta patogenicidad H5N8, clado 2.3.4.4b de Egipto (A/focha común/Egipto/ CA285/2016) con base en la tasa de mortalidad, signos clínicos, lesiones macroscópicas, seroconversión, eliminación del virus y cambios histopatológicos. Los resultados revelaron que la tasa de mortalidad en patos reales y Pekín, en un régimen de vacunación con dosis única fue de 10% y 0%, respectivamente en comparación con 40% y 0% en patos no vacunados y desafiados, respectivamente. En los patos reales y Pekín, con un esquema de vacunación con dosis doble, la tasa de mortalidad fue del 0% en comparación con 60% y 40% en los patos no vacunados y desafiados, respectivamente. Los patos reales desarrollaron signos clínicos y lesiones más severos en comparación con los patos Pekín.

Although the outbreak was controlled, vaccines were considered as an alternative control method, and new vaccines were approved and purchased by the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Veterinary Stockpile for emergency use. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of two of these vaccines in protecting Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica) against challenge with a H5N2 HPAI poultry isolate. A recombinant alphavirus-based vaccine and an inactivated adjuvanted reverse genetics vaccine, both expressing the hemagglutinin gene of a U.S. H5 clade 2.3.4.4 isolate (A/Gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014 H5N8), were used to immunize the ducks. The vaccines were given either as single vaccination at 2 days of age or in a prime-boost strategy at 2 and 15 days of age. At 32 days of age, all ducks were challenged with A/turkey/Minnesota/12582/15 H5N2 HPAI virus clade 2.3.4.4. All ducks from the nonvaccinated challenge control group became infected and shed virus; one duck in this group presented mild ataxia, and a second duck died. No mortality or clinical signs were observed in vaccinated and challenged ducks, with the exception of one duck presenting with mild ataxia. Both vaccines, regardless of the vaccination strategy used, were immunogenic in ducks and reduced or prevented virus shedding after challenge. In conclusion, good protection against H5Nx infection was achieved in ducks vaccinated with the vaccines examined, which were homologous to the challenge virus, with prime-boost strategies conferring the best protection against infection. Eficacia de dos vacunas con licencia contra influenza aviar H5 frente a un desafío con un virus de la influenza aviar altamente patógeno H5N2 en patos domésticos de los Estados Unidos del año 2015 y del clado 2015 2.3.4.4. Los virus de la influenza aviar altamente patógena (HPAI) 2.3.4.4 del linaje H5 ganso/Guangdong causaron un brote importante en la avicultura de los Estados Unidos en el año 2015. Aunque el brote fue controlado, las vacunas se consideraron un método de control alternativo y nuevas vacunas fueron aprobadas y adquiridas por la Reserva Nacional Veterinaria del Departamento de Agricultura de los Estados Unidos para uso en caso de emergencia. En este estudio, se evaluó la eficacia de dos de estas vacunas en la protección de patos Pekin frente al desafío con un aislamiento aviar H5N2 de alta patogenicidad. Se utilizaron una vacuna recombinante basada en alfavirus y una vacuna generada por genética inversa, inactivada y con adyuvante, ambas expresando el gene de la hemaglutinina de un aislamiento H5 clado 2.3.4.4 (A/Gyrfalcon/Washington/41088-6/2014 H5N8), para inmunizar los patos. Las vacunas se administraron como vacunación única a los 2 días de edad o con un programa de primovacunación y refuerzo a los 2 y 15 días de edad. A los 32 días de edad, todos los patos fueron desafiados con el virus de alta patogenicidad A/turkey/Minnesota/12582/15 H5N2 clado 2.3.4.4. Todos los patos del grupo control no vacunado y desafiado se infectaron y excretaron al virus; un pato en este grupo presentó ataxia leve y un segundo pato murió. No se observó mortalidad o signos clínicos en patos vacunados y desafiados, con la excepción de un pato que presentó ataxia leve. Ambas vacunas, independientemente de la estrategia de vacunación utilizada, fueron inmunogénicas en patos y redujeron o evitaron la diseminación del virus después del desafío. En conclusión, se logró una buena protección contra la infección por H5N2 en los patos vacunados con las vacunas evaluadas, las cuales eran homólogas al virus de desafío y las estrategias de primovacunación y refuerzo confirieron la mejor protección contra la infección.",2019,seungeun.han,4,"HPAI - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza","Ducks (Anatidae)"

In this study, we generated a chimeric QH/KJ recombinant virus expressing the entire haemagglutinin (HA)-1 region of the HPAI virus A/chicken/China/QH/2017(H5N6) (clade 2.3.4.4) and the HA2 region of the HPAI virus A/chicken/China/KJ/2017(H5N1) (clade 2.3.2.1). The resulting chimeric PR8-QH/KJ virus exhibited similar in vitro growth kinetics as the parental PR8-QH and PR8-KJ viruses. The chimeric PR8-QH/KJ virus induced specific, cross-reactive haemagglutination-inhibition and serum-neutralizing antibodies against both QH and KJ viruses, although PR8-QH and PR8-KJ exhibited no cross-reactivity with each other. Furthermore, the chimeric PR8-QH/KJ vaccine significantly reduced virus shedding and completely protected chickens from challenge with HPAI H5N6 and H5N1 viruses. However, the Re-8 vaccine against clade 2.3.4.4 viruses provided specific-pathogen-free chickens only partial protection when challenged with QH virus. Our results suggest that the antigenic variation of these epidemic viruses occurred and they can escape the current vaccine immunization. The Re-8 vaccine needs an update.

These outbreaks have proven the limitations of biosecurity control programs, and new tools are needed to reinforce the current avian influenza control arsenal. Some enzootic countries have implemented inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) in their control programs, but there are serious concerns that a long-term use of IIV without eradication may result in the selection of novel antigenically divergent strains. A broadly protective vaccine is needed, such as live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). We showed in our previous studies that pc4-LAIV (a variant that encodes a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein) can provide significant protection against heterologous challenge virus in chickens vaccinated at 2–4 weeks of age through upregulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. The current study was conducted to compare the performances of pc4-LAIV and IIV in young chickens vaccinated at 1 day of age. A single dose of pc4-LAIV was able to induce stronger innate and mucosal IgA responses and protect young immunologically immature chickens better than a single dose of IIV. Most importantly, when 1-day-old chickens were intranasally primed with pc4-LAIV and subcutaneously boosted with IIV three weeks later, they showed a rapid, robust, and highly cross-reactive serum antibody response and a high level of mucosal IgA antibody response. This vaccination regimen warrants further optimization to increase its range of protection. © 2018 Jang et al.

The aim of our studies was to test the efficacy of the same rHVT-H5 vaccine in controlling the transmission of a recent Hungarian HPAIV H5N8 challenge virus in commercial chickens. Broilers and layers were vaccinated at day old according to the manufacturer's recommendation and then challenged with a 2017 Hungarian HPAIV H5N8 (2.3.4.4b) isolate at 5 or 7 weeks of age, respectively. Evaluation of clinical protection, reduction of challenge virus shedding, and transmission to vaccinated contact birds was done on the basis of clinical signs/mortality, detection, and quantitation of challenge virus in oronasal and cloacal swabs (regularly between 1 and 14 days postchallenge). Measurement of seroconversion to AIV nucleoprotein was used as an indicator of infection and replication of challenge virus. Our results demonstrated that rHVT-H5 vaccination could prevent the development of clinical disease and suppress shedding very efficiently, resulting in the lack of challenge virus transmission to vaccinated contact chickens, regardless the type of birds. Single immunization with the tested rHVT-H5 vaccine proved to be effective to stop HPAIV H5N8 (2.3.4.4b) transmission within vaccinated poultry population under experimental conditions.

The outbreak renewed interest in developing intervention strategies, including vaccines, for these newly emergent HPAI viruses. In these studies, several existing H5 vaccines or vaccine seed strains with varying genetic relatedness (85–100%) to the 2.3.4.4 HPAI viruses were evaluated for protection in poultry. Chickens received a single dose of either an inactivated whole H5 AI vaccine, or a recombinant fowl poxvirus or turkey herpesvirus-vectored vaccines with H5 AI hemagglutinin gene inserts followed by challenge with either a U.S. wild bird H5N8 (A/gyrfalcon/Washington/40188-6/2014) or H5N2 (A/northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014) clade 2.3.4.4 isolate. Results indicate that most inactivated H5 vaccines provided 100% protection from lethal effects of H5N8 or H5N2 challenge. In contrast, the recombinant live vectored vaccines only provided partial protection which ranged from 40 to 70%. Inactivated vaccine groups, in general, had lower number of birds shedding virus and at lower virus titers then the recombinant vaccine groups. Interestingly, prechallenge antibody titers using the HPAI challenge viruses as antigen in heterologous vaccine groups were typically low (≤2 log2), yet the majority of these birds survived challenge. Taken together, these studies suggest that existing vaccines when used in a single immunization strategy may not provide adequate protection in poultry against the 2.3.4.4 HPAI viruses. Updating the H5 hemagglutinin to be genetically closer to the outbreak virus and/or using a prime-boost strategy may be necessary for optimal protection. © 2017",2017,seungeun.han,4,"HPAI - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza","Chickens (Gallus)"

A booster effect was found on reduction of virus shedding when using both vaccines, with lower oropharyngeal viral titers at 4 days after challenge with either HPAI virus (P < 0.05). Neither rHVT-H5/2.2 nor standard HVT vaccine could be detected in samples collected from multiple tissues at different time points, indicting minimal levels of viral replication. In conclusion, although a minor effect on survival was observed, this study demonstrates the suboptimal protection with the rHVT-H5/2.2 vaccine given alone in Pekin ducks against H5N1 HPAI viruses and only a minor additive effect on virus shedding reduction when used with an inactivated vaccine in a prime-boost regime. © 2016 American Association of Avian Pathologists.",2016,seungeun.han,4,"HPAI - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza","Ducks (Anatidae)"

In recent years, new H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) still emerged constantly, although all poultry in China were immunized with H5N1 vaccinations compulsorily. To better understand the pathogenicity and transmission of dominant clades of the H5N1 HPAIVs in chicken from Guangdong in 2012, we chose a clade 7.2 avian influenza virus named A/Chicken/China/G2/2012(H5N1) (G2) and a clade 2.3.2.1 avian influenza virus named A/Duck/China/G3/2012(H5N1) (G3) in our study. Our results showed that the chickens inoculated with 103 EID50 of G2 or G3 viruses all died, and the titers of virus replication detected in several visceral organs were high but different. In the naive contact groups, virus shedding was not detected in G2 group and all chickens survived, but virus shedding was detected in G3 group and all chickens died. These results showed that the two clades of H5N1 HPAIVs had high pathogenicity in chickens and the contact transmission of them was different in chickens. The results of cross reactive HI assay showed that antigens of G2 and G3 were very different from those of current commercial vaccines isolates (Re-4, Re-6, and D7). And to evaluate the protective efficacy of three vaccines against most isolates form Guangdong belonging to clade 2.3.2.1 in 2012, G3 was chosen to challenge the three vaccines such as Re-4, Re-6, and D7. First, chickens were immunized with 0.3 ml Re-4, Re-6, and D7 inactivated vaccines by intramuscular injection, respectively, and then challenged with 106 EID50 of G3 on day 28 post-vaccination. The D7 vaccine had 100% protection against G3 for chickens, the Re-6 vaccine had 88.9%, and the Re-4 vaccine only had 66.7%. Our results suggested that the D7 vaccine could prevent and control H5N1 virus outbreaks more effectively in Guangdong. From the above, it was necessary to conduct continuously epidemiological survey and study the pathogenicity and antigenic variation of avian influenza in Southern China. © 2016 Jiao, Song, Liu, Song, Cui, Wu, Ye, Qu, Zhang and Liao.",2016,seungeun.han,4,"HPAI - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza","Chickens (Gallus)"

For field use, the overwhelming majority of AI vaccines produced are inactivated whole virus formulated into an oil emulsion. However, recombinant vectored vaccines are gaining use for their ability to induce protection against heterologous isolates and ability to overcome maternal antibody interference. In these studies, we compared protection of chickens provided by a turkey herpesvirus (HVT) vector vaccine expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from a clade 2.2 H5N1 strain (A/swan/Hungary/4999/2006) against homologous H5N1 as well as heterologous H5N1 and H5N2 highly pathogenic (HP) AI challenge. The results demonstrated all vaccinated birds were protected from clinical signs of disease and mortality following homologous challenge. In addition, oral and cloacal swabs taken from challenged birds demonstrated that vaccinated birds had lower incidence and titers of viral shedding compared to sham-vaccinated birds. Following heterologous H5N1 or H5N2 HPAI challenge, 80-95% of birds receiving the HVT vector AI vaccine at day of age survived challenge with fewer birds shedding virus after challenge than sham vaccinated birds. In vitro cytotoxicity analysis demonstrated that splenic T lymphocytes from HVT-vector-AI vaccinated chickens recognized MHC-matched target cells infected with H5, as well as H6, H7, or H9 AI virus. Taken together, these studies provide support for the use of HVT vector vaccines expressing HA to protect poultry against multiple lineages of HPAI, and that both humoral and cellular immunity induced by live vaccines likely contributes to protection. © 2015 .",2015,seungeun.han,4,"HPAI - Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza","Chickens (Gallus)"

This study investigated the role of Indonesian licensed vaccines, specific vaccine seed strains, and emerging variant field viruses as causes of vaccine failures. Eleven of 14 licensed vaccines contained the manufacturer's listed vaccine seed strains, but 3 vaccines contained a seed strain different from that listed on the label. Vaccines containing A/turkey/Wisconsin/ 1968 (WI/68), A/chicken/Mexico/28159-232/1994 (Mex/94), and A/turkey/England/N28/1973 seed strains had high serological potency in chickens (geometric mean hemagglutination inhibition [HI] titers, ≥1:169), but vaccines containing strain A/chicken/Guangdong/1/1996 generated by reverse genetics (rg; rgGD/96), A/chicken/Legok/2003 (Legok/03), A/chicken/Vietnam/ C57/2004 generated by rg (rgVN/04), or A/chicken/Legok/2003 generated by rg (rgLegok/03) had lower serological potency (geometric mean HI titers, ≤1:95).

One dose of rHVT-H5 vaccine was administered at day 1 and birds were monitored serologically (haemagglutination inhibition test) and virologically for 19 weeks. Maternally-derived antibody and post-vaccination H5 antibody titres were measured using the Chinese (A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96(H5N1)) HA and the Egyptian (A/chicken/Egypt/128s/2012(H5N1)) HA as antigens. The challenge was conducted at 19 weeks of age and on six experimental groups: Groups I (WB) and II (BS), both vaccinated and challenged; Groups III (WB) and IV (BS), both vaccinated but not challenged; Groups V and VI, unvaccinated specific pathogen free chickens, serving respectively as positive and negative controls. The challenge virus was the clade 2.2.1 highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 A/chicken/Egypt/128s/2012 at a dose of 106median embryo infective dose. For both breeds, complete maternally-derived antibody waning occurred at the age of 4 weeks. The immune response to rHVT-H5 vaccination was detected from the sixth week. The seroconversion rates for both breeds reached 85.7 to 100% in the eighth week of age. Protection levels of 73.3%, 60% and 0% were respectively recorded in Groups I, II and V.

The purpose of this study was to further determine the vaccine's potential to infect mosquitoes, the duration of humoral immunity to 24 months postvaccination, and the ability to prevent disease and viremia from a virulent challenge. Vaccination experiments conducted in sheep found no evidence of a potential for vector transmission to 4 North American mosquito species.

A single vaccination with each vaccine resulted in a neutralizing antibody response within three weeks after vaccination and protected lambs from viremia, pyrexia and mortality. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,seungeun.han,4,"Rift Valley fever virus","Sheep (Ovis aries)"

The RVF Smithburn vaccine produced in South Africa and used successfully to prevent and control the disease in endemic sub-Saharan countries was compared to the candidate vaccine RVF Clone 13. Five sero-negative calves per vaccine group were vaccinated with a single dose of each vaccine and tested for antibody response. All vaccinated calves were challenged with a highly virulent RVF virus together with five unvaccinated calves used as control of the challenge. Protection was confirmed in all vaccinated animals as they did not show any clinical signs typical of RVF. A good neutralizing antibody response was induced post-vaccination and no viraemia could be detected post-challenge in calves of both vaccine groups. All non-vaccinated control animals showed clinical symptoms of RVF, high viraemia and were euthanized. This study reported the first case of blindness in cattle resulting from virulent RVF virus infection in unvaccinated calves used as negative controls. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2011,seungeun.han,4,"Rift Valley fever virus","Cattle (Bos taurus)"
