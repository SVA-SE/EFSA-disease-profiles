BTV infection of ruminants results in a high viraemia, suggesting that repeated sharing of needles between animals could result in its iatrogenic transmission. Studies defining the risk of iatrogenic transmission of blood-borne pathogens by less invasive routes, such as subcutaneous or intradermal inoculations are rare, even though the sharing of needles is common practice for these inoculation routes in the veterinary sector. Here we demonstrate that BTV can be transmitted by needle sharing during subcutaneous inoculation, despite the absence of visible blood contamination of the needles. The incubation period, measured from sharing of needles, to detection of BTV in the recipient sheep or cattle, was substantially longer than has previously been reported after experimental infection of ruminants by either direct inoculation of virus, or through blood feeding by infected Culicoides.

No vaccines are currently available and animal slaughtering or area zoning to restrict risk-related movements are the only effective measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Ornithodoros soft ticks are known to transmit the African swine fever virus (ASFV) to pigs in farms, following the natural epidemiologic cycle of the virus. Tick saliva has been shown to modulate the host physiological and immunological responses during feeding on skin, thus affecting viral infection. To better understand the interaction between soft tick, ASFV and pig at the bite location and the possible influence of tick saliva on pig infection by ASFV, salivary gland extract (SGE) of Ornithodoros porcinus, co-inoculated or not with ASFV, was used for intradermal auricular inoculation. Our results showed that, after the virus triggered the disease, pigs inoculated with virus and SGE presented greater hyperthermia than pigs inoculated with virus alone. The density of Langerhans cells was modulated at the tick bite or inoculation site, either through recruitment by ASFV or inhibition by SGE. Additionally, SGE and virus induced macrophage recruitment each. This effect was enhanced when they were co-inoculated. Finally, the co-inoculation of SGE and virus delayed the early local spread of virus to the first lymph node on the inoculation side. This study has shown that the effect of SGE was powerful enough to be quantified in pig both on the systemic and local immune response. We believe this model should be developed with infected tick and could improve knowledge of both tick vector competence and tick saliva immunomodulation.",2016

We evaluated circulating and tissue levels of IL-1 and IL-6 in WTD experimentally infected with EHD virus serotype 2 (EHDV-2). Circulating levels of IL-1 were assayed by ELISA. RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to detect upregulation of IL-1 and IL-6 mRNA as well as protein expression, respectively. RT-PCR was also used to determine whether IL-1 and IL-6 were upregulated in WTD peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) infected with EHDV-2 in vitro. We found increased circulating levels of IL-1 and upregulation of IL-1 mRNA and protein expression and upregulation of IL-6 mRNA in tissues of WTD infected with EHDV. Upregulation of mRNA levels of IL-1 and IL-6 in EHDV infected PBMCs was also observed. Findings suggest a role for IL-1 and IL-6 in the pathogenesis of EHD in WTD.",2015

In 2006, a widespread EHDV-7 epidemic caused disease and economic loss in the Israeli dairy industry. In this study, the main objective was to infect cattle with EHDV-7 and replicate disease observed in Israel during 2006. Two infection studies were performed. Experiment 1, 4 cows inoculated with intradermal (ID) and subcutaneous (SC) injections with an EHDV-7 blood inoculum. Experiment 2, 6 calves inoculated using 1 of the following 3 methods (2 calves/method): (1) mammalian cell culture supernatant by ID and SC injection; (2) culture supernatant by ID, SC, and intravenous injection; and (3) bite transmission from Culicoides sonorensis. Further, during experiment 2, C. sonorensis were fed on 4 infected calves (18 days post-inoculation) and processed for virus isolation 10 days later in order to evaluate infectivity of low-titer viraemia. Three cows had detectable viraemia and all 4 seroconverted. No clinical signs were observed. All 6 calves developed viraemia, peaking 7-10 dpi and all calves seroconverted. No differences in virus kinetics were observed between the inoculation groups. Calves in group 2 had transiently elevated rectal temperatures but no other clinical abnormalities were observed. The 124 midge pools processed after feeding on calves with low-titer viraemia were virus isolation negative. Detectable viraemia was more consistent in calves than adult cows. This study demonstrates US-origin cattle are susceptible to EHDV-7 infection by multiple inoculation methods; however, as reported in other studies, the disease was not replicated experimentally.",2015

Moderate- to low-virulent ASF virus isolates are known to circulate in endemic ASF-affected regions. To improve our knowledge of virus transmission in animals recovered from ASF virus infection, an experimental invivo study was carried out. Four domestic pigs were inoculated with the NH/P68 ASF virus, previously characterized to develop a chronic form of ASF. Two additional in-contact pigs were introduced at 72days post-inoculation (dpi) in the same box for virus exposure. The inoculated pigs developed a mild form of the disease, and the virus was isolated from tissues in the inoculated pigs up to 99dpi (pigs were euthanized at 36, 65, 99 and 134dpi). In-contact pigs showed mild or no clinical signs, but did become seropositive, and a transient viraemia was detected at 28days post-exposure (dpe), thereby confirming late virus transmission from the inoculated pigs. Virus transmission to in-contact pigs occurred at four weeks post-exposure, over three months after the primary infection. These results highlight the potential role of survivor pigs in disease maintenance and dissemination in areas where moderate- to low-virulent viruses may be circulating undetected. This study will help design better and more effective control programmes to fight against this disease.",2015

SBV pathogenesis and viral placental crossing remain currently poorly understood. Therefore, we implemented an experimental infection of ewes, inoculated with SBV at 45 or 60 days of gestation (dg). Methodology ""Mourerous"" breed ewes were randomly separated in three groups: eight and nine ewes were subcutaneously inoculated with 1 ml of SBV infectious serum at 45 and 60 dg, respectively (G45 and G60). Six other ewes were inoculated subcutaneously with sterile phosphate buffer saline as control group. All SBV inoculated ewes showed RNAemia consistent with previously published studies, they seroconverted and no clinical sign was reported. Lambs were born at term via caesarian-section, and right after birth they were blood sampled and clinically examined. Then both lambs and ewes were euthanatized and necropsied. Principal Findings/Significance No lambs showed any malformation suggestive of SBV infection and none of them had RNAemia or anti-SBV antibodies prior to colostrum uptake. Positive SBV RNA detection in organs was rare in both G45 and G60 lambs (2/11 and 1/10, respectively). Nevertheless most of the lambs in G45 (9/11) and G60 (9/10) had at least one extraembryonic structure SBV positive by RTqPCR. The number of positive extraembryonic structures was significantly higher in G60 lambs. Time of inoculation (45 or 60 dg) had no impact on the placental colonization success rate but affected the frequency of detecting the virus in the offspring extraembryonic structures by the time of lambing. SBV readily colonized the placenta when ewes were infected at 45 or 60 dg but infection of the fetuses was limited and did not lead to congenital malformations.",2015

Dogs are the primary reservoirs of this parasite, and vaccination of dogs could be an effective method to reduce its transfer to humans. In order to develop a vaccine against VL (apart from the choice of immunogenic candidate antigens), it is necessary to use an appropriate delivery system to promote a proper antigen-specific immune response. In this study, we compared two vaccine delivery systems, namely electroporation and cationic solid-lipid nanoparticle (cSLN) formulation, to administer a DNA vaccine containing the Leishmania donovani A2 antigen, and L. infantum cysteine proteinases of type I (CPA) and II (CPB) without its unusual C-terminal extension. The protective potencies of these two vaccine delivery systems were evaluated against L infantum challenge in outbred dogs. Our results show that the administration of pcDNA-A2-CPA-CPB-CTE GFP vaccine as a prime-boost by either electroporation or cSLN formulation protects the dogs against L. infantum infection. Partial protection in vaccinated dogs is associated with significantly (p < 0.05) higher levels of IgG2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha and with low levels of IgG1 and IL-10 as compared to the control group. Protection was also correlated with a low parasite burden and a strong delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response. This study demonstrates that both electroporation and cSLN formulation can be used as efficient vaccine delivery systems against visceral leishmaniasis. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to further determine the vaccine's potential to infect mosquitoes, the duration of humoral immunity to 24 months , and the ability to prevent disease and viremia from a virulent challenge. Vaccination experiments conducted in sheep found no evidence of a potential for vector transmission to 4 North American mosquito species. Neutralizing antibodies were elicited, with titers of > 1:40 still present at 24 months postvaccination. Vaccinates were protected from clinical signs and detectable viremia after challenge with virulent virus, while control sheep had fever and high-titered viremia extending for 5 days. Antibodies to three viral proteins (nucleocapsid N, the N-terminal half of glycoprotein GN, and the nonstructural protein from the short segment NSs) were also detected to 24 months using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. This study demonstrates that the MP-12 vaccine given as a single dose in sheep generates protective immunity to a virulent challenge with antibody duration of at least 2 years, with no evidence of a risk for vector transmission.",2015

Control of VL in dogs would dramatically decrease infection pressure of L. infantum for humans, since dogs are the main domestic reservoir.

Wichgers Schreur, Jet Kant, Lucien van Keulen, Rob J. M. Moormann, Jeroen Kortekaas","Four-segmented Rift Valley fever virus induces sterile immunity in sheep after a single vaccination","Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne virus in the Bunyaviridae family, causes recurrent outbreaks with severe disease in ruminants and occasionally humans. The virus comprises a segmented genome consisting of a small (S), medium (M) and large (L) RNA segment of negative polarity. The M-segment encodes a glycoprotein precursor (GPC) protein that is co-translationally cleaved into Gn and Gc, which are required for virus entry and fusion. Recently we developed a four-segmented RVFV (RVFV-4s) by splitting the M-genome segment, and used this virus to study RVFV genome packaging. Here we evaluated the potential of a RVFV-4s variant lacking the NSs gene (4s-Delta NSs) to induce protective immunity in sheep. Groups of seven lambs were either mock-vaccinated or vaccinated with 10(5) or 10(6) tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of 4s-Delta NSs via the intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SC) route. Three weeks post-vaccination all lambs were challenged with wild-type RVFV. Mock-vaccinated lambs developed high fever and high viremia within 2 days post-challenge and three animals eventually succumbed to the infection. In contrast, none of the 4s-Delta NSs vaccinated animals developed clinical signs during the course of the experiment. Vaccination with 10(5) TCID50 via the IM route provided sterile immunity, whereas a 10(6) dose was required to induce sterile immunity via SC vaccination. Protection was strongly correlated with the presence of RVFV neutralizing antibodies. This study shows that 4s-Delta NSs is able to induce sterile immunity in the natural target species after a single vaccination, preferably administrated via the IM route. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Pigs infected with ASF and CSF viruses (ASFV and CSFV) develop clinical signs that may be indistinguishable from other diseases. Likewise, various causes of vesicular disease can mimic clinical signs caused by the FMD virus (FMDV). Early detection is critical to limiting the impact and spread of these disease outbreaks, and the ability to perform herd-level surveillance for all 3 diseases rapidly and cost effectively using a single diagnostic sample and test is highly desirable. This study assessed the feasibility of simultaneous ASFV, CSFV, and FMDV detection by multiplex reverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (mRT-qPCR) in swine oral fluids collected through the use of chewing ropes. Animal groups were experimentally infected independently with each virus, observed for clinical signs, and oral fluids collected and tested throughout the course of infection. All animal groups chewed on the ropes readily before and after onset of clinical signs and before onset of lameness or serious clinical signs. ASFV was detected as early as 3 days postinoculation (dpi), 2-3 days before onset of clinical disease; CSFV was detected at 5 dpi, coincident with onset of clinical disease; and FMDV was detected as early as 1 dpi, 1 day before the onset of clinical disease. Equivalent results were observed in 4 independent studies and demonstrate the feasibility of oral fluids and mRT-qPCR for surveillance of ASF, CSF, and FMD in swine populations.",2015

New serotypes have emerged, however, for which there are no specific commercial vaccines. This study addressed whether heterologous vaccines would help protect against 2 serotypes. Thirty-seven sheep were randomly allocated to 7 groups of 5 or 6 animals. Four groups were vaccinated with commercial vaccines against BTV strains 2, 4, and 9. A fifth positive control group was given a vaccine against BTV-8. The other 2 groups were unvaccinated controls. Sheep were then challenged by subcutaneous injection of either BTV-16 (2 groups) or BTV-8 (5 groups). Taken together, 24/25 sheep from the 4 experimental groups developed detectable antibodies against the vaccinated viruses. Furthermore, sheep that received heterologous vaccines showed significantly reduced viraemia and clinical scores for BTV-16 when compared to unvaccinated controls. Reductions in clinical signs and viraemia among heterologously vaccinated sheep were not as common after challenge with BTV-8. This study shows that heterologous protection can occur, but that it is difficult to predict if partial or complete protection will be achieved following inactivated-BTV vaccination.

Eight dogs were experimentally infected with Leishmania infantum and followed monthly for 12 months to assess clinical, clinicopathological, immunological and parasitological variables. Active infection was produced in 100% of the dogs. The animals showed positive bone marrow (BM) cytologies and cultures, clinical signs, clinicopathological abnormalities and a high specific humoral immune response. The infection was detected at 90 days post-infection (p.i.) by real-time quantitative PCR (rtQ-PCR) on BM in all dogs and in blood in 2 dogs, while anti-L infantum antibody seroconversion occurred between Days 120 and 180 days p.i. The tissue with the highest L. infantum kDNA load, as detected by rtQ-PCR, was BM (range 381.5-70,000 parasites/ml at the study end), this sample type showing greater sensitivity than peripheral blood (PB). The vulvar swabs used here for the first time to quantify parasite loads in dogs revealed a greater load than oral and conjunctival swabs at one year p.i. Urine samples showed the lowest concentrations of L infantum DNA (maximum: 8.57 parasites/ml). Our results suggest that for the early detection of infection, adding to serology a test such as rtQ-PCR on OS or VS improves sensitivity and specificity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

SBV infection induces a long lasting seroconversion under natural conditions. The persistence of the protective immunity and the isotype specific antibody response upon SBV infection of sheep has however not been studied in detail. Five sheep were kept in BSL3 facilities for more than 16 months and subjected to repeated SBV infections. Blood was regularly sampled and organs were collected at euthanasia. The presence of SBV RNA in serum and organs was measured with quantitative real-time PCR. The appearance and persistence of neutralizing and SBV nucleoprotein (N) isotype specific antibodies was determined with virus neutralization tests (VNT) and ELISAs. The primo SBV infection protected ewes against clinical signs, viraemia and virus replication in organs upon challenge infections more than 15 months later. Production of neutralizing SBV specific antibodies was first detected around 6 days post primo-inoculation with VNT and correlated with the appearance of SBV-N specific IgM antibodies. These IgM antibodies remained present for 2 weeks. SBV-N specific IgG antibodies were first detected between 10 and 21 dpi and reached a plateau at 28 dpi. This plateau remained consistently high and no significant decrease in titre was found over a period of more than 1 year. Similar results were found for the neutralising antibody response. In conclusion, the SBV specific IgM response probably eliminates SBV from the blood and the protective immunity induced by SBV infection protects sheep against reinfection for at least 16 months.",2015

SBV causes a subclinical or mild disease in adult animals but vertical transmission to pregnant dams may lead to severe malformations in the offspring. Data on the onset of clinical signs, viremia and seroconversion in experimentally infected adult animals are available for cattle and sheep but are still lacking for goats. For a better understanding of the pathogenesis of SBV infection in adult ruminants, we carried out experimental infections in adult goats. Our specific objectives were: (i) to record clinical signs, viremia and seroconversion; (ii) to monitor viral excretion in the semen of infected bucks; (iii) to determine in which tissues SBV replication took place and virus-induced lesions developed. Results: Four goats and two bucks were inoculated with SBV. Virus inoculation was followed by a short viremic phase lasting 3 to 4 days and a seroconversion occurring between days 7 and 14 pi in all animals. The inoculated goats did not display any clinical signs, gross lesions or histological lesions. Viral genomic RNA was found in one ovary but could not be detected in other organs. SBV RNA was not found in the semen samples collected from two inoculated bucks. Conclusions: In the four goats and two bucks, the kinetics of viremia and seroconversion appeared similar to those previously described for sheep and cattle. Our limited set of data provides no evidence of viral excretion in buck semen.",2015

Experimental infection with virulent WNV strains in the mouse and hamster models frequently results in severe neural infection and moderate to high mortality, both of which are not representative features of most human and equine infections. We have established a rabbit model for investigating pathogenesis and immune response of non-lethal WNV infection. Two species of rabbits, New Zealand White (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and North American cottontail (Sylvilagus sp.), were experimentally infected with virulent WNV and Murray Valley encephalitis virus strains. Infected rabbits exhibited a consistently resistant phenotype, with evidence of low viremia, minimal-absent neural infection, mild-moderate neuropathology, and the lack of mortality, even though productive virus replication occurred in the draining lymph node. The kinetics of anti-WNV neutralizing antibody response was comparable to that commonly seen in infected horses and humans. This may be explained by the early IFNalpha/beta and/or gamma response evident in the draining popliteal lymph node. Given this similarity to the human and equine disease, immunocompetent rabbits are, therefore, a valuable animal model for investigating various aspects of non-lethal WNV infections.",2015

Vaccination is the most effective measure to control vector borne diseases; however, there are 26 known BTV serotypes showing little cross protection. The BTV serotype is mainly determined by genome segment 2 encoding the VP2 protein. Currently, inactivated and live-attenuated Bluetongue vaccines are available for a limited number of serotypes, but each of these have their specific disadvantages, including the inability to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). BTV non-structural proteins NS3 and NS3a are not essential for virus replication in vitro, but are important for cytopathogenic effect in mammalian cells and for virus release from insect cells in vitro. Recently, we have shown that virulent BTV8 without NS3/NS3a is non-virulent and viremia in sheep is strongly reduced, whereas local in vivo replication leads to seroconversion. Live-attenuated BTV6 without NS3/NS3a expression protected sheep against BTV challenge. Altogether, NS3/NS3a knockout BTV6 is a promising vaccine candidate and has been named Disabled Infectious Single Animal (DISA) vaccine. Here, we show serotype-specific protection in sheep by DISA vaccine in which only genome segment 2 of serotype 8 was exchanged. Similarly, DISA vaccines against other serotypes could be developed, by exchange of only segment 2, and could therefore safely be combined in multi-serotype cocktail vaccines with respect to reassortment between vaccine viruses. Additionally, NS3 antibody responses are raised after natural BTV infection and NS3-based ELISAs are therefore appropriate tools for DIVA testing accompanying the DISA vaccine. To enable DIVA, we developed an experimental NS3 ELISA. Indeed, vaccinated sheep remained negative for NS3 antibodies, whereas seroconversion for NS3 antibodies was associated with viremia after heterologous BTV challenge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Clinical disease is mainly observed in sheep, but cattle were unusually affected during an outbreak of BTV seroype 8 (BTV-8) in Europe. We previously developed an experimental vaccine based on recombinant viral protein 2 (VP2) of BTV-8 and non-structural proteins 1 (NS1) and NS2 of BTV-2, mixed with an immunostimulating complex (ISCOM)-matrix adjuvant. We demonstrated that bovine immune responses induced by this vaccine were as good or superior to those induced by a classic commercial inactivated vaccine. In this study, we evaluated the protective efficacy of the experimental vaccine in cattle and, based on the detection of VP7 antibodies, assessed its DIVA compliancy following virus challenge. Two groups of BTV-seronegative calves were subcutaneously immunized twice at a 3-week interval with the subunit vaccine (n=6) or with adjuvant alone (n=6). Following BTV8 challenge 3 weeks after second immunization, controls developed viremia and fever associated with other mild clinical signs of bluetongue disease, whereas vaccinated animals were clinically and virologically protected. The vaccine-induced protection was likely mediated by high virus-neutralizing antibody titers directed against VP2 and perhaps by cellular responses to NS1 and NS2. T lymphocyte responses were cross-reactive between BTV-2 and BTV-8, suggesting that NS1 and NS2 may provide the basis of an adaptable vaccine that can be varied by using VP2 of different serotypes. The detection of different levels of VP7 antibodies in vaccinated animals and controls after challenge suggested a compliancy between the vaccine and the DIVA companion test. This SW subunit vaccine is a promising candidate that should be further evaluated and developed to protect against different serotypes. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Hemorrhages are the most frequently reported lesions in acute and subacute forms of ASF. Hemorrhagic lesions are accompanied by impaired hemostasis, which includes thrombocytopenia and changes in the coagulation system. In the present study, experimental infection was conducted to elucidate whether a highly virulent ASFV genotype II circulating in the Trans-Caucasus and Eastern Europe affects the hemostasis of infected pigs. Platelet count changes and platelet size, as well as coagulation parameters were evaluated upon experimental infection. In contrast to other ASFV strains, ASFV genotype II showed a significant decrease in the number of platelets from 3rd dpi onwards. Furthermore, a decrease in platelet size was observed throughout the entire period of experiment. A significant increase in the number of platelet aggregates was observed from the beginning of infection. Unlike other ASFV strains, ASFV genotype II induced a slight shortening of an activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) throughout the experiment. Thrombin time (TT) was prolonged from day 5 onwards, whereas no changes in prothrombin time (PT) were found upon infection. The level of D-dimers was permanently higher than in control with a peak on day 3 post-infection. ASFV induced a significant decrease in the level of fibrinogen from day 5 till the end of experiment. Thus, it can be concluded that ASFV genotype II isolated in Armenia affects the hemostasis of infected pigs and causes changes that differ from that of other ASFV strains described previously.

Here, we assessed virus and host factors influencing the clinical outcome of BTV infection using a single experimental framework. We investigated how mammalian host species, breed, age, BTV serotypes, and strains within a serotype affect the clinical course of bluetongue. Results obtained indicate that in small ruminants, there is a marked difference in the susceptibility to clinical disease induced by BTV at the host species level but less so at the breed level. No major differences in virulence were found between divergent serotypes (BTV-8 and BTV-2). However, we observed striking differences in virulence between closely related strains of the same serotype collected toward the beginning and the end of the European BTV-8 outbreak. As observed previously, differences in disease severity were also observed when animals were infected with either blood from a BTV-infected animal or from the same virus isolated in cell culture. Interestingly, with the exception of two silent mutations, full viral genome sequencing showed identical consensus sequences of the virus before and after cell culture isolation. However, deep sequencing analysis revealed a marked decrease in the genetic diversity of the viral population after passaging in mammalian cells. In contrast, passaging in Culicoides cells increased the overall number of low-frequency variants compared to virus never passaged in cell culture. Thus, Culicoides might be a source of new viral variants, and viral population diversity can be another factor influencing BTV virulence. IMPORTANCE Bluetongue is one of the major infectious diseases of ruminants. It is caused by an arbovirus known as bluetongue virus (BTV). The clinical outcome of BTV infection is extremely variable. We show that there are clear links between the severity of bluetongue and the mammalian host species infected, while at the breed level differences were less evident. No differences were observed in the virulence of two different BTV serotypes (BTV-8 and BTV-2). In contrast, we show that the European BTV-8 strain isolated at the beginning of the bluetongue outbreak in 2006 was more virulent than a strain isolated toward the end of the outbreak. In addition, we show that there is a link between the variability of the BTV population as a whole and virulence, and our data also suggest that Culicoides cells might function as an ""incubator"" of viral variants.",2014

Three groups of six to seven lambs were immunized as follows: one group received the vaccine (termed rMVA-GnGc), a second group received an MVA vector (vector control) and a third group received saline solution (non-vaccinated control). Fourteen days later, all animals were subcutaneously challenged with 10(5) TCID50 of the virulent RVFV isolate 56/74 and vaccine efficacy assessed using standard endpoints. Two lambs (one from the vaccine group and one from the vector control group) succumbed to RVFV challenge, showing characteristic liver lesions. Lambs from both the vector control and non-vaccinated groups were febrile from days 2 to 5 post challenge (pc) while those in the rMVA-GnGc group showed a single peak of pyrexia at day 3 pc. RVFV RNA was detected in both nasal and oral swabs from days 3 to 7 pc in some lambs from the vector control and non-vaccinated groups, but no viral shedding could be detected in the surviving lambs vaccinated with rMVA-GnGc. Together, the data suggest that a single dose of the rMVA-GnGc vaccine may be sufficient to reduce RVFV shedding and duration of viremia but does not provide sterile immunity nor protection from disease. Further optimization of this vaccine approach in lambs is warranted. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2014

Resistance or susceptibility to developing canine leishmaniasis after exposure to Leishmania infantum is primarily determined by the ability of the immune system to develop an appropriate Th1-dominated specific response to the parasite. For this reason there is a need for effective canine vaccines that can decrease the number of dogs developing progressive infections. In this study, we followed the impact of the LiESP/QA-21 canine vaccine (composed of excreted-secreted proteins of L. infantum and the QA-21 saponin adjuvant), recently launched commercially in Europe, on selected humoral and cellular immune parameters following an infectious intravenous challenge with L. infantum promastigotes administered one year after the primary vaccine course. We also followed parasitological parameters to determine the parasitological status of the challenged dogs. In contrast to controls, vaccinated dogs retained significantly stronger cell-mediated immune responses against the parasite despite a virulent challenge and had significantly lower mean parasite burdens at the end of the study, associated with a lower probability of developing active infections. These results confirm that the immune responses generated by vaccination with LiESP/QA-21 are still effective against an intravenous challenge one year after the primary vaccine course.",2014

It also causes reproductive problems in cattle, sheep and goat including abortions, stillbirths and malformations. The role of pigs in the epidemiology of SBV has not yet been evaluated while this could be interesting seen their suggested role in the epidemiology of the closely related Akabane virus. To address this issue, four 12 week old seronegative piglets were subcutaneously infected with 1 ml of SBV infectious serum (FLI) and kept into contact with four non-infected piglets to examine direct virus transmission. Throughout the experiment blood, swabs and feces samples were collected and upon euthanasia at 28 dpi different organs (cerebrum, cerebellum, brain stem, lung, liver, iliac lymph nodes, kidney and spleen) were sampled. No clinical impact was observed and all collected samples tested negative for SBV in rRT-PCR. Despite the absence of viremia and virus transmission, low and short lasting amounts of neutralizing antibodies were found in 2 out of 4 infected piglets. The limited impact of SBV infection in pigs was further supported by the absence of neutralizing anti-SBV antibodies in field collected sera from indoor housed domestic pigs (n = 106). In conclusion, SBV infection of pigs can induce seroconversion but is ineffective in terms of virus replication and transmission indicating that pigs have no obvious role in the SBV epidemiology.

A previous study, which investigated the pathogenicity and infection kinetics of BTV-26 in goats, unexpectedly revealed that one control goat may have been infected through a direct contact transmission route. To investigate the transmission mechanisms of BTV-26 in more detail an experimental infection study was carried out in which three goats were infected with BTV-26, three goats were kept uninfected, but were housed in direct contact with the infected goats, and an additional four goats were kept in indirect contact separated from infected goats by metal gates. This barrier allowed the goats to have occasional face-to-face contact in the same airspace, but feeding, watering, sampling and environmental cleaning was carried out separately. The three experimentally infected goats did not show clinical signs of BTV, however high levels of viral RNA were detected and virus was isolated from their blood. At 21 dpi viral RNA was detected in, and virus was isolated from the blood of the three direct contact goats, which also seroconverted. The four indirect barrier contact goats remained uninfected throughout the duration of the experiment. In order to assess replication in a laboratory model species of Culicoides biting midge, more than 300 Culicoides sonorensis were fed a BTV-26 spiked blood meal and incubated for 7 days. The dissemination of BTV-26 in individual C. sonorensis was inferred from the quantity of virus RNA and indicated that none of the insects processed at day 7 possessed transmissible infections. This study shows that BTV-26 is easily transmitted through direct contact transmission between goats, and the strain does not seem to replicate in C. sonorensis midges using standard incubation conditions.",2014

However nothing is known about the ability of Culicoides midges to interfere with the infectivity of the viruses they transmit. Among these, Bluetongue Virus (BTV) induces a hemorrhagic fever-type disease and its recent emergence in Europe had a major economical impact. We observed that needle inoculation of BTV8 in the site of uninfected C. nubeculosus feeding reduced viraemia and clinical disease intensity compared to plain needle inoculation. The sheep that developed the highest local inflammatory reaction had the lowest viral load, suggesting that the inflammatory response to midge bites may participate in the individual sensitivity to BTV viraemia development. Conversely compared to needle inoculation, inoculation of BTV8 by infected C. nubeculosus bites promoted viraemia and clinical symptom expression, in association with delayed IFN-induced gene expression and retarded neutralizing antibody responses. The effects of uninfected and infected midge bites on BTV viraemia and on the host response indicate that BTV transmission by infected midges is the most reliable experimental method to study the physio-pathological events relevant to a natural infection and to pertinent vaccine evaluation in the target species. It also leads the way to identify the promoting viral infectivity factors of infected Culicoides in order to possibly develop new control strategies against BTV and other Culicoides transmitted viruses.",2014

The dynamics of shedding and excretion is not well known for this currently circulating ASFV strain. Therefore, susceptible pigs were exposed to pigs intramuscularly infected with the Georgia 2007/1 ASFV strain to measure those dynamics through within- and between-pen transmission scenarios. Blood, oral, nasal and rectal fluid samples were tested for the presence of ASFV by virus titration (VT) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Serum was tested for the presence of ASFV-specific antibodies. Both intramuscular inoculation and contact transmission resulted in development of acute disease in all pigs although the experiments indicated that the pathogenesis of the disease might be different, depending on the route of infection. Infectious ASFV was first isolated in blood among the inoculated pigs by day 3, and then chronologically among the direct and indirect contact pigs, by day 10 and 13, respectively. Close to the onset of clinical signs, higher ASFV titres were found in blood compared with nasal and rectal fluid samples among all pigs. No infectious ASFV was isolated in oral fluid samples although ASFV genome copies were detected. Only one animal developed antibodies starting after 12 days post-inoculation. The results provide quantitative data on shedding and excretion of the Georgia 2007/1 ASFV strain among domestic pigs and suggest a limited potential of this isolate to cause persistent infection.",2014

Repeat testing of blood from donor animals is specified in the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) Manual for the export of semen from regions where BTV may be present. Screening of blood or semen samples has usually been carried out by virus isolation (VI) either by inoculation of chicken embryos followed by passage onto insect and mammalian cell cultures or in vivo inoculation of sheep followed by serology to detect seroconversion. Direct testing of semen for BTV would enable earlier release of semen samples and avoid repeat testing of the donor, as well as provide an option for releasing batches of semen that were collected without certification of the donor. Quantitative (real-time) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays overcome most of the limitations of other methods and have the potential to provide higher sensitivity. The present study compared 5 qRT-PCR assays, including 2 commercially available kits, for the detection of BTV in semen serially collected from 8 bulls over a period of 90 days after experimental infection. The results of the study show that at least one of the qRT-PCR assays is extremely reproducible and has both very high sensitivity and specificity to reliably detect all available serotypes. The preferred qRT-PCR gave consistently superior results to VI, sheep inoculation, and conventional RT-PCR. Therefore, the assay can be recommended for the screening of bovine semen for freedom from BTV.",2014

A subsequent contact challenge experiment was performed in which six IOP-inoculated donor pigs were allowed to have direct contact (DC) with six naive pigs for exposure times that varied from 24 to 72 h. All challenge routes resulted in clinical progression and postmortem lesions similar to those previously described in experimental and natural infection. The onset of clinical signs occurred between 1 and 7 days post inoculation (dpi) and included pyrexia with variable progression to obtundation, hematochezia, melena, moribundity and death with a duration of 4-11 days. Viremia was first detected between 4 and 5 dpi in all inoculation groups whereas ASFV shedding from the nasal cavity and tonsil was first detected at 3-9 dpi. IM and DC were the most consistent modes of infection, with 12/12 (100%) of pigs challenged by these routes becoming infected. Several clinical and virological parameters were significantly different between IM and DC groups indicating dissimilarity between these modes of infection. Amongst the simulated natural routes, INP inoculation resulted in the most consistent progression of disease across the widest range of doses whilst preserving simulation of natural exposure and therefore may provide a superior system for pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy investigation.

Although only five of the 26 reported bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes are considered endemic to the USA, 10 exotic serotypes have been isolated primarily in the southeastern region of the country since 1999. For an exotic BTV serotype to become endemic there must be susceptible animal species and competent vectors. In the USA, sheep and white-tailed deer (WTD) are the primary sentinel livestock and wildlife species, respectively. In 2006, BTV-8 was introduced into Northern Europe and subsequently overwintered, causing unprecedented livestock disease and mortality during the 2006-2007 vector seasons. To assess the risk of the European strain of BTV-8 to North American WTD, and understand the role they could play after a similar introduction, eight bluetongue-seronegative WTD were inoculated with BTV-8. Body temperatures and clinical signs were recorded daily. Blood samples were analyzed for BTV RNA with quantitative real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), serum analyzed for BTV antibodies by cELISA, and tissues taken for histopathology and qRT-PCR. All eight deer became infected and developed moderate to severe clinical disease from days 8 to 15. Peak viremia was from day 7 to 10 with detectable titers through the end of the study (28 days) in most deer. Serum antibody was detected by day 6, peaked by day 10 and continued through day 28. We conclude that North American WTD are highly susceptible to BTV-8 and would act as clinical disease sentinels and amplifying hosts during an outbreak. Published by Elsevier B.V.",2013

Transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in cattle and sheep, with subsequent foetal infection, is a feature of this specific bluetongue serotype. In this study, BTV-8 ability to cross the placental barrier at the beginning of the second third of pregnancy and at the end of pregnancy was investigated in goats in two separate experiments. In the first experiment, nine goats were experimentally infected with BTV-8 at 61 days of pregnancy. Foetuses were collected 21 dpi. BTV-8 was evidenced by real time RT-PCR and by viral isolation using blood from the umbilical cord and the spleens of 3 out of the 13 foetuses. All dams were viraemic (viral isolation) at the moment of sampling of the foetuses. Significant macroscopic or histological lesions could not be observed in foetuses or in their infected dams (notably a the placenta level). In the second experiment, 10 goats were infected with BTV-8 at 135 days of pregnancy. Kids were born by caesarean section at the programmed day of birth (15 dpi). BTV-8 could not be detected by rt-RT-PCR in blood or spleen samples from the kids. This study showed for the first time that BTV-8 transplacental transmission can occur in goats that have been infected at 61 days of pregnancy, with infectious virus recovered from the caprine foetuses. The observed transmission rate was quite high (33%) at this stage of pregnancy. However, it was not possible to demonstrate the existence of BTV-8 transplacental transmission when infection occurred at the end of the goat pregnancy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In adult cattle, SBV is known to cause a mild transient disease; clinical signs include short febrile episodes, decreased milk production and diarrhoea for a few days. However, the knowledge about clinical signs and pathogenesis in adult sheep is limited. In the present study, adult sheep of European domestic breeds were inoculated with SBV either as cell culture grown virus or as virus with no history of passage in cell cultures. Various experimental set-ups were used. Sampling included blood collection at different time points during the experimental period and selected organ material at autopsy. Data from this study showed, that the RNAemic period in sheep was as short as reported for cattle; viral genome was detectable for about 3-5 days by real-time RT-PCR. In total, 13 out of 30 inoculated sheep became RNAemic, with the highest viral load in animals inoculated with virus from low cell culture passaged or the animal passaged material. Contact animals remained negative throughout the study. One RNAemic sheep showed diarrhoea for several days, but fever was not recorded in any of the animals. Antibodies were first detectable 10-14 days post inoculation. Viral RNA was detectable in spleen and lymph nodes up to day 44 post inoculation. In conclusion, as described for cattle, SBV-infection in adult sheep predominantly results insubclinical infection, transient RNAemia and a specific antibody response. Maintenance of viral RNA in the lymphoreticular system is observed for an extended period. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2013

It was first detected in goats in Switzerland in 2008. The virus does not induce clinical signs in infected goats. In field samples viral RNA could be detected only in goats and never in other ruminants. BTV-25 RNA was repeatedly detected for more than one year in the blood of goats from a single flock in Principality of Liechtenstein. Since viral persistence over such a long period has never been reported for bluetongue, blood samples from 110 goats and 2 sheep of that flock were collected during a period of up to two years and analyzed for the presence of BTV-25 RNA and antibodies. Most of the animals which tested positive for BTV-25 RNA, remained positive during the whole investigation period. Moreover, five of these goats were BTV-25 RNA positive over a period of 19-25 months. A weak antibody response against BTV VP7 was commonly observed. As BTV-25 cannot be propagated in any culture system, the presence of virus could only be demonstrated in samples by viral RNA detection using RT-qPCR. To address the question of infectivity of the virus in blood from long-term positive animals, goats were experimentally infected with this blood. Viral replication was demonstrated by increasing RNA amounts. Thus, our findings provide evidence that BTV-25 can persist much longer in an infected host than known so far for other BTV serotypes. Hence, persistence of infectious BTV represents an additional important factor in BTV epidemiology. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2013

However, BTV pathogenesis is still unclear. This study sought to elucidate differences in the pathogenetic mechanisms of BTV-1 and -8 in sheep. For this purpose, a time-course study was carried out, with sequential sacrifices in order to relate pathological lesions to changes in a range of virological and serological parameters. A greater virulence of BTV-1 was probed. BTV-1 infected sheep showed a longer clinical course, with a significant increase of clinical signs and more severe gross lesions than BTV-8 infected sheep. These differences appear not to be attributable to greater virus replication, suggesting viral loads did not influence in the pathogenicity of these serotypes. While both groups displayed an early, intense antibody response, they still developed clinical signs and lesions characteristic of bluetongue, indicating a lack of correlation between antibody levels and protection against the disease. Both acute phase response (APR) and thrombocytopenia induced by BTV-1 in sheep were more intense. Furthermore, an association between acute phase proteins (APPs) concentrations and the evolution of clinical signs and gross lesions was also observed, suggesting the existence of a direct link between the pathogenicity of BTV serotypes, the severity of vascular lesions and the serum concentrations of APPs. To our knowledge, this is the first verification of a measurable APR in sheep with both experimental and naturally occurring bluetongue. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2013

All virus inoculated sheep became infected and seroconverted against the different BTV strains used in this study. BTV RNA was detectable in the blood of all but two ewes for over 28 days but infectious virus could only be detected in the blood for a much shorter period. Interestingly, transplacental transmission of BTV-2 (both field and rescued strains) was demonstrated at high efficiency (6 out of 13 lambs born to BTV-2 infected ewes) while only 1 lamb of 12 born to BTV-8 infected ewes showed evidence of in utero infection. In addition, evidence for horizontal transmission of BTV-2 between ewes was observed. As expected, the parental BTV-2 and BTV-8 viruses and the viruses rescued by reverse genetics showed very similar properties to each other.

In the present study, four Saanen goats were inoculated with the European strain of BTV-8 at 62 days of gestation; this resulted in mild clinical signs, however gross lesions observed post mortem were more severe. Viral RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR in blood and tissue samples from three fetuses harvested from two goats at 43 days post infection. Conventional RT-PCR and genome sequencing targeting viral segment 2 confirmed infection of brain tissue with BTV-8 in two of these fetuses. In total, five of six fetuses demonstrated lesions that may have been associated with transplacental infection with BTV. Infected fetuses did not demonstrate neurological lesions. Low viral RNA concentrations in fetal blood and tissue further suggest that the infected fetuses would probably not have been born viraemic.

Dogs are the main domestic reservoir of the parasite. The establishment of an experimental model that partially reproduces natural infection in dogs is very important to test vaccine candidates, mainly regarding those that use salivary proteins from the vector and new therapeutical approaches. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this report, we describe an experimental infection in dogs, using intradermal injection of Leishmania infantum plus salivary gland homogenate (SGH) of Lutzomyia longipalpis. Thirty-five dogs were infected with 1 x 10(7) parasites combined with five pairs of Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary glands and followed for 450 days after infection and clinical, immunological and parasitological parameters were evaluated. Two hundred and ten days after infection we observed that 31,4% of dogs did not display detectable levels of anti-Leishmania antibodies but all presented different numbers of parasites in the lymph nodes. Animals with a positive xenodiagnosis had at least 3,35 x 10(5) parasites in their lymph nodes. An increase of IFN-gamma and IL-10 levels was detected during infection. Twenty two percent of dogs developed symptoms of CVL during infection. Conclusion: The infection model described here shows some degree of similarity when compared with naturally infected dogs opening new perspectives for the study of CVL using an experimental model that employs the combination of parasites and sand fly saliva both present during natural transmission.",2013

Out of a group of six goats housed in insect free accommodation, five were experimentally infected with BTV-26 and one was kept uninfected as an in-contact control. Samples taken throughout the study were used to determine the kinetics of infection using a pan specific BTV real time RT-PCR assay and a group specific ELISA. The five infected goats did not show clinical signs of BTV, however high levels of viral RNA were detected and virus was isolated from the blood of all 5 goats. Antibodies against BTV were first detected between 7 and 11 dpi in all 5 experimentally infected goats. Interestingly at 21 dpi viral RNA was detected in, and virus was isolated from, the blood of the in-contact control goat, which also seroconverted. These results suggest that BTV-26 replicates to high levels in goats, causing no obvious clinical disease, suggesting that goats may be the natural host for this virus. Preliminary evidence also indicates that BTV-26 may be spread by contact transmission between goats, however a more detailed study is required in order to confirm this observation.

The data presented are derived from an overall and comparative analysis of the clinical outcomes of three groups of dogs intravenously infected with 500,000 promastigotes on different dates (2003, 2006 and 2008). The parasites used for challenge were isolated from a dog having a patent form of leishmaniosis, classified as MCAN/ES/1996/BCN150 zymodeme MON-1. Late-log-phase promastigote forms derived from cultured amastigotes obtained from the spleen of the heavily infected hamsters were used for infection. Only one single infective dose was administered to each dog. After challenge, the animals were monitored for 12 months. To analyze the disease outcome, several biopathological, immunological and parasitological end-points were considered. The analysis of the infected dogs indicated that the development of the clinical disease was very similar in the three experimental challenges, as shown by the immune response, the parasite load and the clinical and histopathological lesions detected at necropsy. A high similarity was also observed between the disease development after the experimental challenge and the one reported to occur in endemic natural infection areas, as various degrees of susceptibility to the disease and even resistance were observed in the experimentally infected animals. We believe that this challenge model faithfully reproduces and mimics the course of a natural infection and that it could be used as a suitable tool for analyzing the efficacy of anti-Leishmania drugs and vaccines.

Other serotypes of BTV had already been present in Europe for more than a decade, but transplacental transmission of these strains had never been demonstrated. To determine whether transplacental transmission is a unique feature of BTV-8 we compared the incidence and pathological consequences of transplacental transmission of BTV-8 to that of BTV-1. Nine pregnant ewes were infected with either BTV-8 or BTV-1. The BTV strains used for the infection were field strains isolated on embryonated chicken eggs and passaged twice on mammalian cells. Blood samples were taken to monitor the viraemia in the ewes. Four weeks after the infection, the foetuses were examined for pathological changes and for the presence of BTV. BTV-8 could be demonstrated in 12 foetuses (43%) from 5 ewes (56%). BTV-1 was detected in 14 foetuses (82%) from 6 ewes (67%). Pathological changes were mainly found in the central nervous system. In the BTV-8 group, lympho-histiocytic infiltrates, gliosis and slight vacuolation of the neuropil were found. BTV-1 infection induced a severe necrotizing encephalopathy and severe meningitis, with macroscopic hydranencephaly or porencephaly in 8 foetuses. In our experimental setting, using low passaged virus strains, BTV-1 was able to induce transplacental transmission to a higher incidence compared to BTV-8, causing more severe pathology.",2013

Moormann","Transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in sheep: BTV viraemia, antibody responses and vaccine efficacy in lambs infected in utero","Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an insect vector transmitted virus which causes an economically important disease in ruminants. BTV infection during pregnancy can result in infection of the foetus, which may lead to the birth of persistently infected or immunotolerant offspring. Since persistently infected animals continuously produce large amounts of virus they could be a source of infection for the insect vector. This could significantly influence the epidemiology of the virus and hence might require additional measures to control a BTV outbreak. Therefore, we investigated the potential of BTV-8 to induce persistent infection or immunotolerance in lambs in an experimental setting. Infection of eighteen 70-75 days pregnant ewes with wild type BTV-8 led to the birth of 25 out of 44 BTV RNA positive lambs (foetal infected, FI). All 23 FI lambs born alive also had anti BTV antibodies at birth; infectious virus could be recovered from 5 out of 25 FI lambs. Viral RNA loads decreased rapidly after birth; 19 out of 20 FI lambs that remained in the experiment until week 14 after birth, were RNA negative at that time. Since persistence of BTV-8 infection could not be demonstrated, we investigated whether foetal infection had an effect on protection against a field virus infection and on efficacy of vaccination. To this end, 5 FI lambs and 5 foetal non-infected (FNI) lambs were vaccinated with the inactivated Bovilis BTV-8 vaccine, five months after birth. Three weeks after the vaccination, all lambs were infected with wild type BTV-8. The foetal infection did not interfere with vaccination efficacy. In contrast, foetal BTV-8 infection induced an immune response which afforded protection against BTV challenge comparable to the level of protection induced by vaccination.",2013

For a better insight in epidemiology, quantitative data on virus excretion is required. Until now, excretion data has mainly focused on the initial stages of the disease. In our study we have studied ASF virus (ASFV) excretion dynamics in persistently infected animals. For this purpose, virus excretion through different routes was quantified over 70 days after infection. Three virus isolates of moderate virulence were used: the Brazil'78, the Malta'78 (a low and a high inoculation dose) and the Netherlands'86 isolate. For each isolate or dose, 10 animals were used. All (Brazil'78 group), or three animals per group were inoculated and the other animals served as contact animals. It was shown that dose (Malta'78 low or high) or infection route (inoculated or naturally infected) did not influence the ASFV excretion (p > 0.05). Nasal, ocular and vaginal excretions showed the lowest ASFV titres. Virus was consistently present in the oropharyngeal swabs, showing two peaks, for up to 70 days. Virus was occasionally present in the faeces, occasionally with very high titres. Viral DNA persisted in blood for up to 70 days. The results presented in this study show that a high proportion of persistently infected animals shed virus into the environment for at least 70 days, representing a possible risk for transmission and that should be considered in future epidemiological analysis of ASF.

The present study examines the outcome of an experimental EHDV-7 infection of Holstein cattle and East Frisian sheep. Apart from na ve animals that had not been exposed to BTV, it included animals that had been experimentally infected with either BTV-6 or BTV-8 two months earlier. In addition, EHDV-infected cattle were subsequently challenged with BTV-8. Samples were tested with commercially available ELISA and real-time RT-PCR kits and a custom NS3-specific real-time RT-PCR assay. Virus isolation was attempted in Vero, C6/36 and KC cells (from Culicoides variipennis), embryonated chicken eggs and type I interferon receptor-deficient IFNAR-I- mice. EHDV-7 productively infected Holstein cattle, but caused no clinical signs. The inoculation of East Frisian sheep, on the other hand, apparently did not lead to a productive infection. The commercial diagnostic kits performed adequately. KC cells proved to be the most sensitive means of virus isolation, but viremia was shorter than 2 weeks in most animals. No interference between EHDV and BTV infection was observed; therefore the pre-existing immunity to some BTV serotypes in Europe is not expected to protect against a possible introduction of EHDV, in spite of the close relation between the viruses.

The susceptibility of potential North American vector and ruminant hosts to infection with EHDV-7 is not known but is essential to understanding the potential for establishment of this exotic orbivirus in North America if it were introduced. Our primary objective was to determine whether white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus) are susceptible to infection with EHDV-7. Six, 8-mo-old WTD were experimentally infected with EHDV-7, and all became infected and exhibited varying degrees of clinical disease. Clinical signs, clinicopathologic abnormalities, and postmortem findings were consistent with previous reports of orbiviral hemorrhagic disease (HD) in this species. Four of six animals died or were euthanized because of the severity of disease, one on postinoculation day (PID) 5 and the remaining WTD on PID 7. All deer had detectable viremia on PID 3, which peaked on PID 5 or 6 and persisted for as long as PID 46 in one animal. Deer surviving the acute phase of the disease seroconverted by PID 10. Based on the 67% mortality rate we observed, this strain of EHDV-7 is virulent in WTD, reaffirming their role as a sentinel species for the detection of endemic and nonendemic EHDV. Further, the observed disease was indistinguishable from previous reports of disease caused by North American EHDV and bluetongue virus serotypes, highlighting the importance of serotype-specific diagnostics during suspected HD outbreaks.",2012

Weingartl","Innate Immune Response to Rift Valley Fever Virus in Goats","Rift Valley fever (RVF), a re-emerging mosquito-borne disease of ruminants and man, was endemic in Africa but spread to Saudi Arabia and Yemen, meaning it could spread even further. Little is known about innate and cell-mediated immunity to RVF virus (RVFV) in ruminants, which is knowledge required for adequate vaccine trials. We therefore studied these aspects in experimentally infected goats. We also compared RVFV grown in an insect cell-line and that grown in a mammalian cell-line for differences in the course of infection. Goats developed viremia one day post infection (DPI), which lasted three to four days and some goats had transient fever coinciding with peak viremia. Up to 4% of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were positive for RVFV. Monocytes and dendritic cells in PBMCs declined possibly from being directly infected with virus as suggested by in vitro exposure. Infected goats produced serum IFN-gamma, IL-12 and other proinflammatory cytokines but not IFN-alpha. Despite the lack of IFN-alpha, innate immunity via the IL-12 to IFN-gamma circuit possibly contributed to early protection against RVFV since neutralising antibodies were detected after viremia had cleared. The course of infection with insect cell-derived RVFV (IN-RVFV) appeared to be different from mammalian cell-derived RVFV (MAM-RVFV), with the former attaining peak viremia faster, inducing fever and profoundly affecting specific immune cell subpopulations. This indicated possible differences in infections of ruminants acquired from mosquito bites relative to those due to contact with infectious material from other animals. These differences need to be considered when testing RVF vaccines in laboratory settings.",2012

Inclusion of red deer vaccination among BTV control measures should be considered. Four out of twelve BTV antibody negative deer were vaccinated against serotype 1 (BTV-1), and four against serotype 8 (BTV-8). The remaining four deer acted as unvaccinated controls. Forty-two days after vaccination (dpv), all deer were inoculated with a low cell passage of the corresponding BTV strains. Serological and virological responses were analyzed from vaccination until 28 days after inoculation (dpi). The vaccinated deer reached statistically significant (P < 0.05) higher specific antibody levels than the non vaccinated deer from 34 (BTV-8) and 42 (BTV-1) dpv, maintaining stable neutralizing antibodies until 28 dpi. The non vaccinated deer remained seronegative until challenge, showing neutralizing antibodies from 7 dpi. BTV RNA was detected in the blood of the non vaccinated deer from 2 to 28 dpi, whereas no BTV RNA was found in the vaccinated deer. BTV was isolated from the blood of non vaccinated deer from 7 to 28 dpi (BTV-1) and from 9 to 11 dpi (BTV-8). BTV RNA could be identified by RT-PCR at 28 dpi in spleen and lymph nodes, but BTV could not be isolated from these samples. BT-compatible clinical signs were inapparent and no gross lesions were found at necropsy. The results obtained in the present study confirm that monovalent BTV-1 and BTV-8 vaccines are safe and effective to prevent BTV infection in red deer. This finding indicates that vaccination programs on farmed or translocated red deer could be a useful tool to control BTV. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2012

The virus is endemic to the African continent and the Arabian Peninsula and continues to spread into new areas. The explosive nature of RVF outbreaks requires that vaccines provide swift protection after a single vaccination. We recently developed several candidate vaccines and here report their efficacy in lambs within three weeks after a single vaccination. The first vaccine comprises the purified ectodomain of the Gn structural glycoprotein formulated in a water-in-oil adjuvant. The second vaccine is based on a Newcastle disease virus-based vector that produces both RVFV structural glycoproteins Gn and Cc. The third vaccine comprises a recently developed nonspreading RVFV. The latter two vaccines were administered without adjuvant. The inactivated whole virus-based vaccine produced by Onderstepoort Biological Products was used as a positive control. Five out of six mock-vaccinated lambs developed high viremia and fever and one lamb succumbed to the challenge infection. A single vaccination with each vaccine resulted in a neutralizing antibody response within three weeks after vaccination and protected lambs from viremia, pyrexia and mortality.

Identification of BTV challenge-strains that reliably induce viraemia and clinical signs comparable to those in naturally infected animals, is therefore important for vaccine evaluation. Texel cross-breed and Dorset Poll sheep vaccinated with inactivated BTV-8 vaccine ('Bovilis (R) BTV8' from MSD Animal Health), were challenged with low-passage BTV-8 (Northern European strain) grown in either insect (Culicoides) or mammalian cell-cultures. The severity of clinical signs was recorded (using a modified numerical scoring-system, which is described) along with viraemia and serum neutralizing (SN) antibody levels. Low level SN-antibodies were detected at the time of challenge (three weeks after vaccination). All unvaccinated control animals became infected after challenge, developing high SN-antibody titres by 21 days post challenge (dpc). Vaccinees showed faster increases in SN-antibody titres ('booster' response), with significantly higher titres at 6 dpc than unvaccinated controls. Although only limited clinical-signs could be attributed to BTV in younger animals infected with the mammalian-cell-culture derived virus, both BTV-8 challenge preparations induced severe clinical signs comparable to 'bluetongue' observed during natural outbreaks in older unvaccinated animals. Challenge with BTV-8 grown in Culicoides cell-cultures seemed to induce greater severity of clinical-scores and 'post-mortem lesions' than the mammalian-derived BTV-8 strain. Vaccination reduced clinical signs, fever, and viraemia equally well after challenge with either virus preparation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2012

In 2006, a huge BT-outbreak started after incursion of BTV-serotype 8 (BTV8) in North-Western Europe. More recently, BTV6 and BTV11 were reported in North-Western Europe in 2008. These latter strains are closely related to live-attenuated vaccine, whereas BTV8 is virulent and can induce severe disease in ruminants, including cattle. In addition, Toggenburg orbivirus (TOV) was detected in 2008 in Swiss goats, which was recognized as a new serotype of BTV (BTV25). The (re-)emergency of known and unknown BTV-serotypes needs a rapid response to supply effective vaccines, and research to study this phenomenon. Recently, orbivirus research achieved an important breakthrough by the establishment of reverse genetics for BTV1. Here, reverse genetics for two recent BTV strains representing virulent BTV8 and avirulent BTV6 was developed. For this purpose, extensive sequencing of full-genomes was performed, resulting in the consensus sequences of BTV8/net07 and BTV6/net08. The recovery of 'synthetic BTV', respectively rgBTV8 and rgBTV6, completely from T7-derived RNA transcripts was confirmed by silent mutations by which these 'synthetic BTVs' could be genetically distinguished from wild type BTV, respectively wtBTV6 and wtBTV8. The in vitro and in vivo properties of rgBTV6 or rgBTV8 were comparable to the properties of their parent strains. The asymptomatic or avirulent properties of rgBTV6 and the virulence of rgBTV8 were confirmed by experimental infection of sheep. Reverse genetics of the vaccine-related BTV6 provides a perfect start to develop new generations of BT-vaccines. Reverse genetics of the virulent BTV8 will accelerate research on the special features of BTV8, like transmission by species of Culicoides in a moderate climate, transplacental transmission, and pathogenesis in cattle.",2012

Several studies showed that ASFV can influence on porcine blood cells in vitro. Thus, we asked ourselves whether ASFV infection results in changes in porcine blood cells in vivo. A series of experiments were performed in order to investigate the effects of ASFV infection on porcine peripheral white blood cells. Nine pigs were inoculated by intramuscular injection with 10 4 50% hemadsorbing doses of virus (genotype II) distributed in Armenia and Georgia. The total number of fifteen cell types was calculated during experimental infection. Results: Although band-to-segmented neutrophils ratio became much higher (3.5) in infected pigs than in control group (0.3), marked neutropenia and lymphopenia were detected from 2 to 3 days post-infection. In addition to band neutrophils, the high number of other immature white blood cells, such as metamyelocytes, was observed during the course of infection. From the beginning of infection, atypical lymphocytes, with altered nuclear shape, arose and became 15% of total cells in the final phase of infection. Image scanning cytometry revealed hyperdiploid DNA content in atypical lymphocytes only from 5 days post-infection, indicating that DNA synthesis in pathological lymphocytes occurred in the later stages of infection. Conclusion: From this study, it can be concluded that ASFV infection leads to serious changes in composition of white blood cells. Particularly, acute ASFV infection in vivo is accompanied with the emergence of immature cells and atypical lymphocytes in the host blood. The mechanisms underlying atypical cell formation remain to be elucidated.",2012

Infection causes abortions and high mortality in newborn ruminants. The overall human infection rate is <1%; however, fatality rates in those with severe clinical disease have been reported as high as 29%. The potential of RVFV as a bioterrorism agent and/or being accidentally introduced into North America is widely recognized. Currently, regional veterinary biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) diagnostic laboratories lack safe, modern, validated diagnostic tests to detect RVFV. An existing one-step real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assay was modified for quick virus inactivation for use in BSL-2 laboratories, evaluated on serum and tissue samples from experimentally infected lambs and calves, and compared to virus isolation. Viremia was detected in all inoculated sheep with titers reaching 10(6.5) plaque forming units/ml, or up to 1010 viral RNA copies/ml. Viremia in calves was lower and not detected in all inoculated animals; however, all animals became transiently febrile and were infected as determined by rRT-PCR of tissues. Virus was isolated from rRT-PCR-positive liver and/or spleen in 33% of lamb and 41% of calf samples between 2 and 7 days post inoculation. For RVFV antigen detection, reagents are typically produced at BSL-3Ag or BSL-4 conditions and require inactivation and safety testing for use outside of containment. In this study, antiserum against recombinant RVFV-nucleocapsid (N) was produced to develop an immunohistochemical (IHC) assay which was subsequently evaluated on formalin fixed lamb and calf tissues at BSL-2 laboratory conditions. Antigen was detected by IHC in 79% of rRT-PCR-positive sheep and 70% of rRT-PCR-positive calf tissues tested. Once validated and approved by national regulatory agencies, these assays can be safely produced and distributed to regional diagnostic laboratories, providing capacity for early detection of RVFV in suspected ruminant samples.

The aim of this study was to assess the pathogenicity and infection kinetics of EHD in Holstein-Friesian cattle infected with the two distinct strains of EHDV-6 isolated from the recent Turkish and Moroccan outbreaks. Samples taken throughout the study were used to validate two recently developed diagnostic assays that detect EHDV antibodies and viral genome. Two groups of five Holstein-Friesian cattle were experimentally infected with either the Moroccan or the Turkish isolate of EHDV-6. Cattle in both groups remained clinically unaffected throughout the study, but displayed high levels of viral RNA and virus in their blood, confirming that sub-clinical infection of cattle is likely to play an important role in EHDV transmission. A recently developed and commercialised real-time RT-PCR assay detected viral RNA as early as 2 days post infection (dpi) in both infection studies and viral RNA persisted for the course of the study. Antibodies against EHDV were first detected by 9 dpi using a recently developed EHDV blocking ELISA and antibodies persisted up to the end of the study. All animals developed high levels of neutralising antibodies to EHDV-6, measured by a serum neutralisation test (SNT), with titres (log 10) ranging from 2.20 to 2.38 at the end of the study.

In the experimental infection of pregnant goats described here, TOV could not be detected in secretion/excretion samples or fetal blood. Material from the goat experiment was used as inoculum for propagating the virus in vitro. To enhance the infectivity of TOV several modified protocols, e.g. pretreatment of the virus with trypsin, polyethylene glycol-mediated infection and lipofection were applied. Isolation of TOV, attempts to infect Culicoides nubeculosus by feeding TOV-positive blood and intracerebral inoculation of newborn mice were unsuccessful. The results of these studies suggest that TOV requires specific but different factors than other BTVs for infection and replication outside of its natural caprine host. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Using laboratory-passaged moderately virulent bluetongue virus serotype 23 (BTV-23), one of the most prevalent Indian serotype, we investigated the pathogenesis of BT in intradermally (ID) and intravenously (IV) inoculated native sheep. The ID inoculation resulted in relatively increased clinical signs and lesions in many organs as compared to IV inoculation. BTV-23 detection by real-time RT-PCR and isolation studies revealed that ID inoculation can be more efficient than IV ones in disseminating and spreading virus to systemic organs, including pre-scapular draining lymph node, spleen, lungs and pulmonary artery. Furthermore, the ID inoculation resulted in early onset and increased humoral response with significant increase (P<0.01) in antibody titre at various intervals. Taken together, these data suggest that ID inoculation can be more potent in reproducing many aspects of natural infection, including clinical disease, viral and immune responses, and may be useful route in setting up experimental infections for challenge or pathogenesis studies using laboratory passaged BTVs.

Animals of the groups A, C and B (B: controls) were challenged with a virulent inoculum containing BTV-8. During the experiment, it was found out that the BTV-8 challenge inoculum was contaminated with another BTV serotype. However, results demonstrated that vaccination of goats with two injections of BTVPUR ALSAP 8 or BOVILIS BTV8 provided a significant clinical protection against a BTV-8 challenge and completely prevented BTV-8 viraemia in all vaccinated animals.

Little is known regarding the early stages of infection in natural hosts. Twelve adult Holstein steers were inoculated with Vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus (VSNJV) on the coronary bands (CB) of the feet via scarification (SC) or by VSNJV-infected black fly ( Simulium vittatum) bite (FB). Three additional animals were inoculated on the neck skin using FB. Clinical disease and lesion development were assessed daily, and animals were euthanatized from 12 hours post inoculation (HPI) through 120 HPI. The animals inoculated in the neck failed to develop any clinical signs or gross lesions, and VSNJV was detected neither by in situ hybridization (ISH) nor by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Lesions on the CB were more severe in the animals infected by FB than by SC. In both groups, peak VSNJV replication occurred between 24 and 48 HPI in keratinocytes of the CB, as evidenced by ISH and IHC. There was evidence of viral replication limited to the first 24 HPI in the local draining lymph nodes, as seen through ISH. Successful infection via FB required logarithmically less virus than with the SC technique, suggesting that components in black fly saliva may facilitate VSNJV transmission and infection in cattle. The lack of lesion development in the neck with the same method of inoculation used in the CB suggests that specific characteristics of the CB epithelium may facilitate VSNJV infection.",2011

In the first experiment, 16 ewes were infected with BTV-8 at 70-75 days gestation. The foetuses were collected at 18-19 days after infection (dpi). BTV-8 could be isolated from at least two organs of 19 out of 40 lambs and from 11 out of 16 infected ewes. In the second experiment, 20 BTV-8 infected ewes in early gestation (day 40-45) were euthanized at 10 days (10 ewes) or 30 days (10 ewes) after infection. The presence of BTV could be demonstrated in two foetuses from two ewes at 10 dpi and in 4 foetuses from four ewes at 30 dpi. The main pathological findings in the foetuses in mid gestation were meningo-encephalitis and vacuolation of the cerebrum. In the foetuses early at gestation, haemorrhages in various foetal tissues and necrosis and haemorrhages in the placentomes were found. These experiments demonstrate for the first time the presence of infectious BTV in lamb foetuses at different stages of gestation, combined with a difference in transmission rate depending on the gestation stage. The high transmission rate found at mid term gestation (69%) makes our model very suitable for further research into the mechanisms of transplacental transmission and for research into the reduction of this route of transmission through vaccination.",2011

To generate a potential disabled infectious single cycle (DISC) vaccine strain, we used a reverse genetics system to rescue defective virus strains with large deletions in an essential BTV gene that encodes the VP6 protein (segment S9) of the internal core. Four VP6-deficient BTV-1 mutants were generated by using a complementing cell line that provided the VP6 protein in trans. Characterization of the growth properties of mutant viruses showed that each mutant has the necessary characteristics for a potential vaccine strain: (i) viral protein expression in noncomplementing mammalian cells, (ii) no infectious virus generated in noncomplementing cells, and (iii) efficient replication in the complementing VP6 cell line. Further, a defective BTV-8 strain was made by reassorting the two RNA segments that encode the two outer capsid proteins (VP2 and VP5) of a highly pathogenic BTV-8 with the remaining eight RNA segments of one of the BTV-1 DISC viruses. The protective capabilities of BTV-1 and BTV-8 DISC viruses were assessed in sheep by challenge with specific virulent strains using several assay systems.

The use of virus grown in cultured cells is discouraged because culture passages can lead to changes in virus phenotype, including reduced replication efficiency and virulence in the host, while the OIE considers clinical disease in control animals indispensable evidence of successful infection. In the present study, two groups of five sheep were inoculated with either infectious calf blood lysate or culture-grown bluetongue virus of serotype 8 (BTV-8) (2 x 10(4)TCID(50) and 5 x 10(5)TCID(50), respectively). No pronounced difference in the induction and progression of viraemia as determined by real-time RT-PCR, which is the most objective parameter in the evaluation of vaccine efficacy, was observed. In a second experiment, the virulence of both inocula was confirmed by fatal infection of interferon receptor-deficient mice. The recent availability of highly sensitive molecular methods for the detection of BTV can finally shift the focus away from clinical disease. For the sake of objective and repeatable BTV challenge experiments, the OIE should reconsider its policy on culture-grown virus. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2010

Outbreaks of serotypes 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 16 are challenging Central and Western Europe since 1998. Measures to control or eradicate bluetongue virus (BTV) from Europe have been implemented, including movement restrictions and vaccination of domestic BTV-susceptible ruminants. However, these measures are difficult to apply in wild free-ranging hosts of the virus, like red deer (Cervus elaphus), which could play a role in the still unclear epidemiology of BT in Europe. We show for the first time that BTV RNA can be detected in European red deer blood for long periods, comparable to those of domestic ruminants, after experimental infection with BTV-1 and BTV-8. BTV RNA was detected in experimentally infected red deer blood up to the end of the study (98-112 dpi). BTV-specific antibodies were found in serum both by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and virus neutralization (VNT) from 8 to 12 dpi to the end of the study, peaking at 17-28 dpi. Our results indicate that red deer can be infected with BTV and maintain BTV RNA for long periods, remaining essentially asymptomatic. Thus, unvaccinated red deer populations have the potential to be a BT reservoir in Europe, and could threaten the success of the European BTV control strategy. Therefore, wild and farmed red deer should be taken into account for BTV surveillance, and movement restrictions and vaccination schemes applied to domestic animals should be adapted to include farmed or translocated red deer.

Animals of all breeds developed clinical signs, viremia and pathological lesions, demonstrating that BTV-8 is fully capable of replicating and inducing bluetongue disease (BT) in the investigated sheep. Necropsy performed between 10 and 16 days post-infectionem (d.p.i.) revealed BT-typical hemorrhages, effusions, edema, erosions and activation of lymphatic tissues. Hemorrhages on the base of the Arteria pulmonalis and the left Musculus papillaris subauricularis were frequently present. Histology confirmed the macroscopical findings. Using a score system, clinical manifestation and pathology were found to be significantly related. Furthermore, clinical signs and fever were shown to be indicative for the concurrent presence of high amounts of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) in blood. Spleen, lung, lymph nodes and tonsils from all animals were analyzed regarding viral RNA loads and infectivity using real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) and virus isolation in cell culture, respectively. The highest amount of viral RNA was detected in spleen and lung and rRT-PCR revealed to be a more sensitive method for virus detection compared to virus isolation. A long-term follow-up was performed with three sheep showing that BTV-8 viral RNA in blood was present up to 133 d.p.i. and in certain tissues even on 151 d.p.i. No significant breed-related differences were observed concerning clinicopathological picture and viremia, and the Swiss sheep were as susceptible to BTV-8 infection as Poll Dorset sheep, demonstrating a remarkably high virulence of BTV-8 for indigenous sheep breeds.

However, there is not a vaccination method in veterinary use in this area, and therefore the development of a vaccine against this parasite is essential for the possible control of the disease. Previous reports have shown the efficacy of heterologous prime-boost vaccination with the pCIneo plasmid and the poxvirus VV (both Western Reserve and MVA strains) expressing L. infantum LACK antigen against canine leishmaniasis. As pCIneo-LACK plasmid contains antibiotic resistance genes, its use as a profilactic method is not recommended. Hence, the antibiotic resistance gene free pORT-LACK plasmid is a more suitable tool for its use as a vaccine. Here we report the protective and immunostimulatory effect of the prime-boost pORT-LACK/MVA-LACK vaccination tested in a canine experimental model. Vaccination induced a reduction in clinical signs and in parasite burden in the liver, an induction of the Leishmania-specific T cell activation, as well as an increase of the expression of Th1 type cytokines in PBMC and target organs.

Necropsy of sheep demonstrated bluetongue-typical hemorrhages in the wall of the pulmonary artery. Viral RNA was detected in organs, e.g. spleen, palatine tonsils, lung and several lymph nodes of three experimentally infected animals. Unlike other bluetongue virus serotypes, it was not possible to propagate the virus, either from naturally or experimentally infected animals in any of the tested mammalian or insect cell lines or in embryonated chicken eggs. In small ruminants, TOV leads to mild bluetongue-like symptoms. Further investigations about prevalence of this virus are needed to increase the knowledge on its epidemiology. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The efficacy of these vaccines was evaluated in a pilot study in sheep immunised under field conditions by clinical, virological and serological examination before and after experimental challenge infection with a BTV-8 field isolate. Antibody levels prior to challenge infection differed between the vaccinated groups, but all seroconverted animals were fully protected against clinical disease and virus replication.

To overcome this problem a DIVA test that looks at a differential immune response to bluetongue virus (BTV) non-structural protein 3 (NS3) was developed. The NS3 encoding gene of strain BTV4/22045/PT04 was inserted into expression vector pET-28a and expressed in Escherichia coli strain JM109. Recombinant NS3 protein was used as an antigen in an indirect ELISA (NS3-ELISA) to measure the serologic response to NS3 protein in cattle and sheep. Following a cattle vaccination/challenge experiment with a bivalent inactivated BTV 2-4 vaccine, NS3 antibodies were detected at approximately 15 days post-infection in control unvaccinated animal, while vaccinated animals did not develop detectable NS3 antibodies and, with exception of one, remained negative even after virus challenge. The inactivated vaccine induced antibodies against the major core structural protein (VP7) of BTV as well as neutralizing antibodies in all animals. To evaluate the applicability of NS3-ELISA in field scenario, a total of 562 serum samples collected from uninfected, BTV-infected and vaccinated animals were tested for NS3 antibodies. Taken together, the results confirm that NS3 antibodies were induced to the greatest levels in animals infected with BTV in comparison to the levels induced in animals immunized with inactivated BTV vaccines, implying that antibody response to NS3 allows the differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals.

The introduction of BTV serotype 8 (BTV-8) in Europe has been characterized by the manifestation of clinical signs in infected cattle. In order to study the pathogenesis of BTV-8 in this host, an animal model able to reproduce the clinical manifestations of the disease is required. In this work, two calves were subcutaneously and intravenously injected with a low passage cell-adapted strain of BTV-8. Both calves showed typical bluetongue clinical signs, including pyrexia, ocular discharge, conjunctivitis, oral mucosal congestion, development of ulcers and necrotic lesions on the lips and tongue, submandibular oedema, coronitis and oedema of the coronet and pastern region. A score was assigned depending on the severity of the lesions and a total clinical score was calculated for each animal daily and at the end of the experiment. Both calves became viraemic 24 h post-infection and seroconversion occurred between 7 and 11 days P.I.

When testing serial sera and plasma from sheep experimentally infected with wild-type RVFV, there was 100% agreement between results of the RT-LAMP, a TaqMan-based real-time PCR, and virus isolation. Similarly, the assay had very high levels of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity when testing various clinical specimens from humans and animals naturally infected with the virus during recent outbreaks of the disease in Africa. The detection of specific viral genome targets in positive clinical specimens was achieved in less than 30 min. As a highly accurate, rapid, and very simple nucleic acid detection format, the RT-LAMP has the potential to be used in less-well-equipped laboratories in Africa and as a portable device during RVF outbreaks in remote areas, and it can be a valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of viral hemorrhagic fevers.",2009

As it is the only member of the Asfarviridae family, ASFV encodes many novel genes not encoded by other virus families. Among these genes, A238L may regulate the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines, controlled mainly by NF kappa B and NFAT pathways. In this study, we inoculated two groups of pigs, one with the ASFV highly virulent E-70 isolate, deleted on A238L gene, and the other group with the parental E-70 isolate. No significant differences were observed in the clinical signs or pathology between both groups. However, the TNF-alpha mRNA expression was strongly enhanced in the PBMC from pigs inoculated with the virus deleted in A238L, reinforcing the role of the A238L gene in the inhibition of the NF kappa B pathway of expression of cytokines. No up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed in the PBMC of animals inoculated with the E-70 isolate, even though apoptosis and haemorrhages were evident and might be related to the presence of bystander monocyte-macrophages expressing these cytokines.

The results obtained showed that dog vaccination priming with DNA-LACK followed by a booster with MVA-LACK or rVV-LACK triggered a Th1 type of immune response, leading to protection against canine visceral. leishmaniasis. This protection correlated with absence of visceral leishmaniasis symptoms, lower Leishmania-specific antibodies, higher degree of T cell activation in Leishmania-target organs and higher synthesis of Th1 cytokines. In addition, we found that dogs boosted with the non-replicative virus show Less VL symptoms and higher degree of T cell activation, providing evidences for a clear advantage of MVA-LACK as a vaccination vector against canine visceral leishmaniasis.

The method uses three primer sets, each one specific for the corresponding virus, selected to detect of all serotypes of FMD and VS. The detection range was confirmed by examination of a collection of 31 isolates of the three target viruses. The specificity of the assay was also demonstrated by testing other related viruses, uninfected cell line cultures and healthy pig tissues. The testing of blood and serum samples from animals infected experimentally proved that the method can be useful for early diagnosis of the diseases, even before the first vesicular lesions are visualized in the infected pigs. An assessment of the performance of the multiplex RT-PCR was carried out using a panel of more than 100 samples from animals infected experimentally, showing the suitability of the method for a rapid (less than 6 h), sensitive and specific differential diagnosis in clinical samples. Additionally, a uniplex RT-PCR for VSV, that amplifies the two viral serotypes, was also developed and tested as a rapid tool for the diagnosis of this vesicular disease. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This strategy would reduce the incidence of disease in both the canine and, indirectly, the human population. Different vaccination approaches have been investigated against canine leishmaniasis (CaL) but to date there is only one licensed vaccine against this disease in dogs, in Brazil. DNA immunization is a promising method for inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses against this parasitic disease. Here, we report the results of a multiantigenic plasmid DNA vaccine encoding KMPII, TRYP, LACK and GP63 L. infantum antigens against experimentally induced CaL. Twelve dogs were randomly assigned to two groups receiving, at a 15 days interval, either four doses of plasmid DNA or similar injections of PBS. After vaccination, dogs were intravenously challenged with 5 x 10(7) promastigotes of L. infantum. The vaccine showed to be safe and well-tolerated. Neither cellular immune response nor antibodies directed against whole Leishmania antigen were detected after immunization in vaccinated dogs, although anti-LACK-specific antibodies were sporadically detected in two vaccinated dogs before challenge, thus suggesting that antigens were indeed expressed. A delay in the development of detectable specific immune response and parasite multiplication in vaccinated dogs was observed after challenge. Nevertheless, the multiantigenic Leishmania DNA vaccine was unable to induce protection against parasite dissemination or disease. This study emphasizes the need to strengthen DNA vaccines in order to obtain effective immune responses in models other than the murine. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2007

To date, there have been no longitudinal studies that perform a serial analysis of the intensity of infection in conjunction with immunological parameters and clinical signs in Leishmania-infected dogs. For this purpose, six dogs were infected experimentally by the i.v. route and were monitored for I year. Clinical, immunological (humoral and cellular response) and parasitological (parasitaemia) parameters were evaluated monthly. Four dogs developed clinico-pathological signs compatible with leishmaniasis, whereas two dogs showed few abnormalities during the study. Evaluation of clinical, immunological and parasitological parameters showed that the intensity of Leishmania infection in blood samples, as indicated by the amount of Leishmania DNA, was correlated significantly with IgG, IgG1, IgG2, IgA, and IgM concentrations and with clinical signs. Parasitaemia and Leishmania-specific cell-mediated immunity were inversely correlated. Moreover, higher quantities of Leishmania DNA were detected in the liver, spleen, lymph node, skin and bone marrow of dogs exhibiting clinical signs than those exhibiting few such signs. These findings suggest that progressive disease in experimental canine leishmaniasis is associated with specific T-cell unresponsiveness and unprotective humoral responses which allow the dissemination and multiplication of L. infantum in different tissues.

Leishmune (R)-treated dogs showed significantly higher levels of anti-FML IgG antibodies (ANOVA; p < 0.0001), a higher and stable IgG2 and a decreasing IgG I response, pointing to a TH1 T cell mediated response. The vaccine had the following effects: it led to more positive delayed type hypersensitivity reactions against Leishmania lysate in vaccinated dogs (75%) than in controls (50%), to a decreased average of CD4+ Leishmania-specific lymphocytes in saline controls (32.13%) that fell outside the 95% confidence interval of the vaccinees (41.62%, CI95% 43.93-49.80) and an increased average of the clinical scores from the saline controls (17.83) that falls outside the 95% confidence interval for the Leishmune (R) immumotherapy-treated dogs (15.75, CI95% 13.97-17.53). All dogs that received the vaccine were clustered, and showed lower clinical scores and normal CD4+ counts, whereas 42% of the untreated dogs showed very diminished CD4+ and higher clinical score. The increase in clinical signs of the saline treated group was correlated with an increase in anti-FML antibodies (p < 0.0001), the parasitological evidence (p = 0.038) and a decrease in Leishinania-specific CD4+ lymphocyte proportions (p = 0.035). These results confirm the immunotherapeutic potential of the enriched-Leishmune (R) vaccine. The vaccine reduced the clinical symptoms and evidence of parasite, modulating the outcome of the infection and the dog's potential infectiosity to phlebotomines.

Clinical signs, lesions, antibody development, viral shedding and persistence, and viremia were monitored. Horses were infected with both viruses by all routes as confirmed by seroconversion. Salivation, primary lesions at inoculation sites, and secondary oral lesions were the most common clinical findings. Viral shedding was most often from the oral cavity, followed by the nasal cavity; titers were highest from oral cavity samples. Virus was rarely isolated from the conjunctival sac and never from feces or blood. Development of neutralizing antibody coincided with cessation of lesion development and detection of virus by isolation. Circulating virus-specific IgM, IgG, IgA, and neutralizing antibodies developed in most animals postinoculation (PI) days 6 to 12, depending on the route of inoculation. At postmortem (PI days 12 to 15), lesions were healing, were not vesicular, and did not contain detectable virus by isolation, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, or immunohistochemistry. Numerous infiltrating lymphocytes and plasma cells suggested that lesion resolution was partially due to local immunity. Detection of viral RNA from tonsil and lymph nodes of head at necropsy suggests that these tissues play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease; molecular techniques targeting these tissues may be useful for confirming infection in resolving stages of disease. The routes of inoculation used in this study reflect the diversity of transmission routes that may occur during outbreaks and can be used to further study contact and vector transmission, vaccine development, and clarify pathogenesis of the disease in horses.",2006

This report presents combined independent work from two laboratories investigating the possible recovery of Bluetongue virus (BTV) over a protracted period after infection of both sheep and cattle. Prior to infection with either cell-culture-adapted or non-culture-adapted BTV, sheep were subjected to a preliminary exposure to Culicoides sp. insects, which reportedly facilitates recovery of virus from infected sheep several months post-infection (p.i.). A series of skin biopsies at different intervals p.i. was used to establish skin fibroblast (SF) cultures from which attempts were made to detect virus by isolation and by molecular and immunological methods. Also examined was the effect on virus recovery of additional exposure to Culicoides sp. prior to skin biopsy during the post-inoculation period. A herd of cattle sentinels for surveillance of natural BTV infection in northern Australia was monitored prospectively for seroconversion. Evidence of infection initiated attempted virus recovery by establishing SF cultures. It was found that in both cattle and sheep there was not a protracted period over which BTV could be recovered from SF cultures.

Previous genetic studies suggest that mutations in the E2 envelope glycoprotein allow relatively viremia-incompetent, enzootic subtype ID strains to adapt for equine replication, leading to VEE emergence. To test this hypothesis directly, chimeric VEEV strains containing the genetic backbone of enzootic subtype ID strains and the partial envelope glycoprotein genes of epizootic subtype IC and IAB strains, as well as reciprocal chimeras, were used for experimental infections of horses. Insertion of envelope genes from two different, closely related enzootic subtype ID strains into the epizootic backbones resulted in attenuation, demonstrating that the epizootic envelope genes are necessary for the equine-virulent and viremia-competent phenotypes. The partial epizootic envelope genes introduced into an enzootic ID backbone were sufficient to generate the virulent, viremia-competent equine phenotype. These results indicate that a small number of envelope gene mutations can generate an equine amplification-competent, epizootic VEEV from an enzootic progenitor and underscore the limitations of small animal models for evaluating and predicting the epizootic phenotype.",2005

A challenge performed on 14 dogs via the intravenous route with 5 x 10(7) stationary phase promastigotes of the L. infantum JPC strain was 100% successful. During a follow up period of 1.5 years, several parameters were evaluated in order to find the most reliable disease markers. Parasite detection by culture and histology were found to be very sensitive (100%). Additionally, regular physical examination, serology and serum gamma-globulin levels were found to be useful parameters in the evaluation of disease severity and are recommended for inclusion in vaccination-challenge experiments. Although this intravenous challenge model has practical limitations, the data set confirms it is the best experimental model currently available for vaccine development. Two intravenously infected dogs were treated with corticosteroids for 5 months. This treatment was shown to enhance all aspects of a Leishniania infection. Five more dogs were infected by sub-dermal injection of promastigotes mixed with a proteophosphoglycan-matrix (PSG) secreted by Leishmania that assists in transmission and infection by sand fly bite. The resulting parasite burdens were low and the animals remained asymptomatic during a 2-year follow up period. However, this procedure did result in infection in 80% of the dogs and is appealing for future development as a natural challenge model in vaccine development. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Dogs were intravenously infected with 10(8) metacyclic L. infantum promastigotes. Promastigotes of the MHOM/MA/67/ITMAP-263 and MHOM/FR/78/LEM75 strains were, respectively, administered 2 months (at day 84, homologous challenge 1) and 8 months post-immunization (at day 273, heterologous challenge 2). The data indicated that vaccine candidate confers total protection (100%) against challenges 1 and 2 in dogs from groups 3 and 4 and intermediate protection (66.7%) against challenge 1 in dogs from group 2 as determined by parasite detection in bone marrow aspirates during 14 months post-challenge follow-up. All placebo dogs of group 1 were found infected and failed to respond to LiESAp in cell-mediated assays before and after both challenges. Increased levels of total anti-leishmanial antibodies were exclusively detected in infected dogs from group 1. Vaccine-induced protection correlates with an early establishment of a long lasting predominantly Th1-type cellular immune response specifically directed against LiESAp before and after experimental infections, as demonstrated by: (i) anti-LiESAp IgG2 reactivity, and (ii) LiESAp-specific lymphocyte proliferation assays and enhanced NO-mediated anti-leishmanial activity of canine monocyte-derived macrophages (CM-DM) in response to higher IFN gamma production by T-cells, when L. infantum-infected CM-DM were co-cultured with autologous lymphocytes. Overall, our results support the view that a LiESAp vaccine might be useful in a promising vaccination approach against natural L. infantum infection. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Interleukin-12 is considered to have an essential role in the development of both innate and adaptive immunity to Leishmania spp. and other intracellular pathogens. This study focused on the influence of IL-12 in experimental and natural canine visceral leishmaniasis. Responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to IL-12, interleukin-10 and Leishmania soluble antigen were evaluated in L. infantum experimentally infected oligosymptomatic beagles, uninfected beagles, naturally infected polysymptomatic dogs, and their matched uninfected controls. Leishmania soluble antigen induced strong peripheral blood mononuclear cells proliferation both in experimentally infected dogs (median stimulation index [SI] = 15.01), and in naturally infected dogs (SI = 8.86), but not by cells from the control groups. IL-12 addition further enhanced cell proliferation in naturally (SI = 14.95), but not in experimentally infected animals. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from experimentally infected dogs were able to produce significant amounts of IFN-gamma (3.39 ng/ml) upon LSA stimulation, but no such production was detected in cells from naturally infected or control animals. Interestingly, addition of IL-12 reversed the inhibitory effect of LSA on IFN-gamma production by cells from polysymptomatic naturally infected dogs and the uninfected beagles (4.84 and 7.45 ng/ml, respectively), and further increased IFN-gamma production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from experimentally infected oligosymptomatic dogs (29.28 ng/ml). IFN-gamma mRNA expression correlated well with IFN-gamma production. Addition of IL-10 to Leishmania soluble antigen stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells inhibited proliferation and IFN-gamma production in experimentally infected dogs. Thus, the ability of IL-12 to augment IFN-gamma production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from dogs with experimental or natural symptomatic canine visceral leishmaniasis makes it a good candidate for cytokine therapy in dogs that are refractory to current therapy.

Experimental infection of pigs with infected blood resulted in pyrexia, which peaked two to four days postinfection, followed by death in five to six days postinfection. Postmortem examination revealed widespread hemorrhage, congestion and edema of tissues. The lymph nodes, spleen, liver and kidneys showed marked focal random necrosis and loss of lymphocytes from the splenic and lymphoid follicles. There was an acute orchitis with massive neutrophilic and macrophage infiltrates into the intertubular connective tissue. Meningitis and focal hemorrhages were observed in the brain and spinal cord. The outbreak was believed to be a continuation of an eastward spread of ASF from neighboring Benin, which began the previous year (1997).",2005

Control of disease in dogs appears to be one of the most effective approaches for interrupting the domestic cycle of the disease. In search for successful vaccine strategies, we evaluated the cysteine proteinases (CPs) type I and II using a heterologous prime-boost regime for vaccination against experimental visceral leishmaniasis in dogs. Following vaccination and challenge, dogs were followed for 12 months. Ten dogs vaccinated by prime/boost with DNA/recombinant CPs (in combination with CpG ODN and Montanide 720) remained free of infection in their bone morrow. In contrast, three out of four dogs in the control groups had infection in their bone marrow. The peripheral lymphocytes from protected animals had generally higher proliferation responses to F/T antigen, recombinant CPA (rCPA) and recombinant CPB (rCPB) than controls. During post-challenge period, the difference in stimulation index is significant ( p<0.05) on months 11 and 12 to F/T antigens, all months for rCPA and 5, 7, 9, 11 and 12 months for rCPB. Analysis of cytokine mRNA level suggested that vaccinated dogs had elevated IFN-gamma mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), whereas there was a consistent increase in the level of IL-10 in the control groups and some vaccinated dogs. The level of total IgG and IgG2, but not IgG1, to rCPA and rCPB was significantly higher in the vaccinated group ( p<0.05) than the control groups. We also showed that with the exception of one dog, all dogs in the vaccinated group in comparison to control dogs had strong DTH responses. We propose that the combination of DNA and recombinant protein vaccination using CPs could be instrumental to control (VL) in dogs.",2005

Real-time RT-PCR was optimized to quantify JEV using the detection system (Rotor Gene 2000 detector) and dual-labeled fluorogenic probes. The gene specific labeled fluorogenic probe for the 3' non-translated region (3' NTR) was used to detect JEV. When the specificity of the assay using specific JEV primers was evaluated by testing three different JEV strains, other swine viruses and bovine viral diarrhea virus, no cross-reactions were detected with non-JE reference viruses. A single tube TaqMan assay was shown to be 10-fold more sensitive than the conventional two-step RT-PCR method. Detection limits of two step and real-time RT-PCR for JEV were 112 TCID(50) /ml and 11.2 TCID(50) /ml, respectively. Quantification of JEV was accomplished by a standard curve plotting cycle threshold values (C(t)) versus infectivity titer. Real-time RT-PCR assay using single tube method could be used as a sensitive diagnostic test, and supplied the results in real time for detection and quantification of JEV. We could detect JEV RNA genome in plasma samples of pigs inoculated with KV1899 strain at 2 days post inoculation, but couldn't in 41 fetus samples.

Twenty-one cows, 14 of which were at different stages of gestation, were vaccinated with 2 ml of monovalent vaccine; two served as unvaccinated controls. After immunisation, 16 vaccinated and the 2 unvaccinated controls were kept in the field; the remaining 5 pregnant cows were maintained in an insect-proof stable with a controlled environment. Blood samples were taken from field cattle once a week for two months and from the stable cattle three times a week. All samples were screened for the presence of BTV and for BT antibody using the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA) and the virus neutralisation (VN) test. Intravenous egg inoculation, followed by two blind passages in Vero cells, was used to isolate BTV-2 from ethylene-diaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) blood samples and virus titres in viraemic animals were determined. After immunisation, 9 of the cows developed a viraemia which commenced on day 7 post vaccination (pv) and lasted for three weeks. The virus titres were never higher than 10(2.8)TCID50/ml with the highest titre observed on day 14 pv. None of the vaccinated animals developed clinical symptoms that could be attributed to BTV; after three weeks all animals showed a serological response to BTV-2. In the c-ELISA, antibodies were detected from day 7 pv while in the VN test, antibodies were observed from day 21 pv. All pregnant cows completed their gestation: 13 gave birth to healthy calves, while one of those in the field group, vaccinated at the six months gestation, delivered a calf with prosencephalic hypoplasia, possibly developed during foetal organogenesis prior to vaccination. Fourteen months after immunisation the stabled cows were challenged subcutaneously by administering 2x10(6.8)TCID50 BTV-2 Italian isolate. A third group of 4 cows was also inoculated with the BTV-2 Italian field isolate, as described for the second group and was used as the unvaccinated positive control group. Vaccinated cows had a detectable viraemia only on day 14 pv and virus titres were very low. Virus titres never exceeded 10(2.3)TCID50/ml, while the unvaccinated group developed a long and intense viraemia, peaking on day 14 pv with a titre of 1.18x10(4).

Animals-128 pigs. Procedure-Pigs were challenged with VSV-NJ or VSV-I from the 1995 and 1997 outbreaks of vesicular stomatitis in the western United States, respectively, or with VSV-NJ (OS) associated with vesicular stomatitis in feral pigs on Ossabaw Island, Ga. Pigs (3/group) were inoculated with each virus via 3 routes and evaluated for viral shedding, seroconversion, and the development of vesicular lesions. In another experiment, the potential for contact transmission of each virus from experimentally infected to naive pigs was evaluated. Results-Infection of pigs was achieved for all 3 viruses as determined by virus isolation and detection of seroconversion. In inoculated pigs, all 3 viruses were isolated from multiple swab samples at concentrations sufficient to infect other pigs. However, compared with results obtained with the 2 VSV-NJ strains, viral titers associated with VSV-I were low and the duration of virus shedding was reduced. Results from the contact transmission trials were consistent with these results; virus transmission was detected most frequently with the VSV-NJ strains. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Pigs can be infected with VSV-NJ and VSV-I. Differences in the extent of viral shedding and potential for contact transmission were apparent between serotypes but not between the VSV-NJ strains investigated.",2004

The method uses two primer sets, each one specific for the corresponding virus, amplifying DNA fragments different in length, allowing a gel-based differential detection of the PCR products. Universal detection of ASF and CSF virus strains was achieved through selection of primers in conserved viral genome regions. The detection range was confirmed by analysis of a large collection of isolates of the two viruses. The high specificity of the assay was proven by testing related viruses, uninfected cell line cultures and healthy pig tissues. Additional confirmatory tests of the ASF and CSF virus amplicon specificity, based on restriction endonuclease analysis with BsmA I or Ban II, respectively, are also described. The analysis of whole blood and serum samples from experimentally infected animals proved the usefulness of the method for an early diagnosis of both diseases, even before the appearance of the first clinical signs. A study of 150 positive field samples from several ASF and CSF outbreaks showed the suitability of this method for a rapid (less than five hours), sensitive and specific differential diagnosis in clinical samples. In addition, a highly sensitive and specific uniplex RT-PCR for CSFV was also developed and standardised as a powerful tool for fast and early diagnosis of the disease.",2004

Six virus isolates induced haemadsorption and four were non-haemadsorbing (non-HAD) in pig macrophage cell cultures. The restriction enzyme site maps of two non-HAD viruses, when compared with a virulent HAD isolate, showed a deletion of 9-6 kbp in the fragment adjacent to the left terminal fragment and of 1(.)6 kbp in the right terminal fragment and an insertion of 0(.)2 kbp in the central region. The six HAD viruses isolated were pathogenic and produced typical acute African swine fever in pigs and the four non-HAD isolates were non-pathogenic. Pigs that were infected with non-HAD viruses were fully resistant or had a delay of up to 14 days in the onset of disease, after challenge with pathogenic Portuguese viruses. Non-HAD viruses could be transmitted by contact but with a lower efficiency (42-50%) compared with HAD viruses (1100%). The clinical differences found between the virus isolates from the ticks could have implications for the long-term persistence of virus in the field because of the cross-protection produced by the non-pathogenic isolates.

Three dogs primarily inoculated with amastigotes (Group I) and four with cultured virulent stationary phase promastigotes (Group II) were afterwards re-inoculated with 2 x 10(9) amastigotes per kg. Three other groups of dogs were used as controls: Group III was infected only once with amastigotes, Group IV only once with promastigotes and Group V was non infected. The animals were followed up by clinical and parasitological examinations, hematological and serum protein analysis, anti-leishmanial antibody levels and proliferative assays of specific peripheral blood mononuclear cells over a period up to 50 months. Parasites were isolated from lymph node of three animals during primary amastigote infection and in five animals (Group I and II) after re-challenge. Group I dogs presented a strong increase of the humoral immune response while Group II animals displayed no significant or significantly low antileishmanial antibodies titres, after re-challenge. The detection, only after challenge, of positive specific lymphoproliferation in two animals of Group II that had the longest primary infection interval (more than 26 months), indicates the requirement of a long time interval to obtain specific lymphocyte sensitization. A previous exposure to virulent cultured L. infantum promastigotes seems to confer some degree of resistance against an amastigote infection. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",2003

Three ponies were inoculated intradermally with 4, 5, and 6 logs, respectively, of the NVSL VEE IE 93-42124 viral isolate. All ponies showed fluctuations in body temperature, encephalitis, and other signs of infection with VEE virus. Virus was isolated only from the blood of ponies from day 1 to day 3 postinfection. Microscopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue sections showed mild to moderate nonsuppurative encephalitis, perivascular cuffing by mononuclear cells, gliosis, and meningoencephalitis. Antibody (IgM) to VEE virus IE was unable to differentiate between various subserotypes of VEE I viruses (serotypes IAB, IC, ID, and IF). Virus neutralizing antibody titers to heterologous VEE I viruses were 10-100-fold less than those for NVSL VEE IE 93-42124 virus and Mena 11, a human isolate of VEE IE virus.

In this paper, we describe the effectiveness of the prime-boost strategy by immunizing dogs with a plasmid carrying the gene for the LACK antigen from Leishmania infantum (DNA-LACK) followed by a booster with a rVV containing the same gene (rVV-LACK). Thereafter, animals were challenged with L. infantum to induce visceral leishmaniasis (VL). In the vaccinated dogs as compared with the controls, the outcome of the infection after challenge with a high inoculum (108) of L. infantum stationary promastigotes was assessed by tissue parasite load, specific anti-Leishmania antibody production, cytokine level and development of clinical signs of leishmaniasis. We observed a 60% protection against infection in dogs immunized by DNA-LACK prime/rVV/-LACK boost while two doses of DNA-LACK did not elicit protection against the disease. The interleukin 4 (IL-4), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-12 (p40 subunit) cytokine mRNA expression profiles in PBMC as well as lymphocyte proliferative response and the IgG2/IgG1 ratios specific for LACK suggest that in vaccinated animals there is triggering of cellular immune responses.

Significant increase in serum antibodies against Leishmania was observed only in the intravenously infected group (P = 0.004).

Five O. virginianus texanus fawns and five O. virginianus borealis fawns were infected with 10(7.1) median tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of EHD virus, serotype 1 and five of each subspecies were infected with 107.1 TCID50 of EHD virus, serotype 2. Infections with both EHD virus serotypes caused severe clinical disease and mortality in O. virginianus borealis fawns, whereas disease was mild or nondetectable in O. virginianus texanus fawns. Virus titers and humoral immune response were similar in both subspecies suggesting that differences in innate disease resistance explain the differences seen in clinical disease severity.

We experimentally tested whether deer surviving EHDV-2 infection would be protected against subsequent infection with EHDV-1, and used field data to examine the possibility of reciprocal cross-protection. Eleven white-tailed deer fawns (Odocoileus virginianus) were experimentally infected with EHDV-2 and later challenged With EHDV-1. Two EHDV-2-naive fawns also were infected with EHDV-1. Deer were monitored via physical examination, complete blood counts, clotting profiles, viral isolation, and serology, and each animal was assigned a quantitative clinical disease severity score based on presence of certain physical and clinical parameters. Infection of naive controls with EHDV-1 caused severe clinical disease and death of both fawns, whereas deer previously infected with EHDV-2 exhibited no or minimal signs of disease. Thus, infection with EHDV-2 conferred protection against disease caused by subsequent EHDV-1 infection. Although prior EHDV-2 exposure protected deer from severe clinical disease, it did not prevent infection nor viremia indicating they could still act as virus amplifying hosts.

The highest viremia level in horses fed upon by the recipient mosquitoes was approximately 460 Vero cell PFU/mL. All mosquitoes that fed upon viremic horses were negative for the virus.

Viral replication was observed mainly in PIMs, which at the same time showed intense activation. accompanied by the expression of IL-1alpha and TNF-alpha. The occurrence of interstitial oedema, neutrophil sequestration and fibrin microthrombi in septal capillaries coincided with high degrees of cytokine expression by infected PIMs. Alveolar macrophages did not show a significant change in cytokine expression as a result of ASF infection, and viral replication was detected in only a low percentage of these cells.

Dogs were inoculated by oral ingestion of adult ticks containing H. canis oocysts. Transstadial transmission of H. canis was recorded, whereas transovarial transmission could not be demonstrated.

Nine of 12 dogs (75%) inoculated with naturally fed or percutaneously injected ticks became parasitologically positive, and all showed seroconversion. Meronts were initially detected in the bone marrow 13 days postinoculation and gamonts 28 days after infection. The variation in the time of initial detection of parasitemia among infected dogs and the rapid appearance of gamonts in dogs immunosuppressed with corticosteroids suggest that immune mechanisms play an important role in controlling H. canis parasitism.

Animals-63 pigs Procedure-Serologically naive pigs were housed in direct contact with pigs that were experimentally inoculated with VSV-NJ via ID inoculation of the apex of the snout, application to a scarified area of the oral mucosa, application to intact oral mucosa, or ID inoculation of the ear. In a second experiment, pigs infected with VSV-NJ by contact were moved and housed with additional naive pigs. Pigs were monitored and sampled daily for clinical disease and virus isolation and were serologically tested before and after infection or contact. Results-Contact transmission developed only when vesicular lesions were evident. Transmission developed rapidly; contact pigs shed virus as early as 1 day after contact. in pens in which contact transmission was detected, 2 of 3 or 3 of 3 contact pigs were infected. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Transmission was lesion-dependent; however, vesicular lesions often were subtle with few or no clinical signs of infection. Contact transmission was efficient, with resulting infections ranging from subclinical (detected only by seroconversion) to clinical (development of vesicular lesions). Long-term maintenance of VSV-NJ via contact transmission alone appears unlikely. Pigs represent an efficient large-animal system for further study of VSV-NJ pathogenesis and transmission.",2001

Mahan","Antibody responses to MAP 1B and other Cowdria ruminantium antigens are down regulated in cattle challenged with tick-transmitted heartwater","Serological diagnosis of heartwater or Cowdria ruminantium infection has been hampered by severe cross reactions with antibody responses to related ehrlichial agents. A MAP 1B indirect enzyme-linked immunosor bent assay that has an improved specificity and sensitivity for detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies has been developed to overcome this constraint (A. H. M. van Vliet, B. A, M. Van der Zeijst, E. Camus, S. M. Mahan, D. Martinez, and F. Jongejan, J, Clin. Microbiol. 33:2405-2410, 1995). When sera were tested from cattle in areas of endemic heartwater infection in Zimbabwe, only 33% of the samples tested positive in this assay despite a high infection pressure (S. M;I. Mahan, S. M. Samu, T. F. Peter, and F. Jongejan, Ann. N.Y. Acad, Sci 849:85-87, 1998). To determine underlying causes for this observation, the kinetics of MAP 1B-specific IgG antibodies in cattle after tick-transmitted C. ruminantium infection and following recovery were investigated, Sera collected weekly over a period of 52 weeks from 37 cattle, which were naturally or experimentally infected with C. ruminantium via Amblyomma hebraeum ticks, were analyzed. MAP 1B-specific IgG antibody responses developed with similar kinetics in both field- and laboratory-infected cattle. IgG levels peaked at 4 to 9 weeks after tick infestation and declined to baseline levels between 14 and 33 weeks, despite repeated exposure to infected ticks and the establishment of a carrier state as demonstrated by PCR and xenodiagnosis, Some of the serum samples from laboratory, and field-infected cattle were also analyzed by immunoblotting and an indirect fluorescent-antibody test (IFAT) to determine whether this observed seroreversion was specific to the MAP 1B antigen. Reciprocal IFAT and immunoblot MAP 1-specific antibody titres peaked at 5 to 9 weeks after tick infestation but also declined between 30 and 45 weeks. This suggests that MAP 1B-specific IgG antibody responses and antibody responses to other C. ruminantium antigens are down regulated in cattle despite repeated exposure to C. ruminantium via ticks. Significantly, serological responses to the MAP 1B antigen may not be a reliable indicator of C. ruminantium exposure in cattle in areas of endemic heartwater infection.",2001

This outbreak is important in understanding VEE emergence because phylogenetic studies imply that sympatric, enzootic, subtype ID VEE viruses mutated to generate the epizootic/epidemic. Although the 1992-1993 strains belong to subtype IC, a serotype implicated in extensive outbreaks during the 1960s and in 1995, relatively small numbers of human and equine cases occurred in 1992-1993. We, therefore, evaluated the pathogenicity of these Venezuelan enzootic ID and epizootic IC viruses to determine 1) if they exhibit phenotypes like those described previously for more distantly related enzootic and epizootic strains. and 2) if the 1992-1993 outbreak was limited by the inability of these IC viruses to exploit equines as amplification hosts. All strains were virulent in mice and guinea pigs, but were benign for cotton rats, natural hosts of enzootic viruses. However, only the IC strains produced equine disease, with mean peak viremias of 10(5) suckling mouse 50% lethal doses per mL serum, and some titers exceeding 10(7). These viremias approximate those observed previously with VEE strains isolated during more extensive epizootics, suggesting that efficient equine amplification did not limit the scope and duration of the 1992-1993 outbreak. Enzootic ID virus infection protected all horses from challenge with epizootic strain P676, supporting the hypothesis that epizootics bypass regions of enzootic transmission due to natural immunization of equines by enzootic VEE viruses.",2001

Longitudinal clinical and immunological studies on 31 pigs inoculated oronasally or intramuscularly with this isolate defined two discrete groups of animals: those developing ASF chronic type lesions and those remaining asymptomatic. Animals developing lesions had viraemia and fever late after infection, NK activity levels close to that of control animals and high levels of anti-ASFV specific antibodies together with a marked hypergammaglobulinaemia involving IgG1, lgG2, IgM and IgA immunoglobulin isotypes. Pigs remaining asymptomatic after infection, on the other hand, did not have viraemia or fever after day 14 post-infection and had elevated Nh cell activity, but normal plasma Ig concentrations and relatively low specific anti-virus antibody concentrations throughout the duration of the experiments. Importantly, the latter group of pigs virus were resistant to subsequent challenge with the highly virulent ASFV/L60 isolate and survived with no major changes in any of the parameters examined and referred to above. Finally, lymphoproliferative responses to the mitogens concanavalin A, phytohaemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen were not depressed in either of the two clinically defined groups of pigs.

This emphasizes the need for early and rapid detection of the virus and an efficient surveillance system. To this goal, a single tube or a nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method focusing on the NSs coding region of the S segment was developed and used to detect the RVF virus (RVFV) genome, resulting respectively in the synthesis of 810 and 662 bp DNA amplimers. The assay was specific for RVFV and did not amplify any other phleboviruses known to circulate in sub-Saharan Africa. When serial dilutions of RVFV were artificially mixed with human normal serum, the minimal detection limits were 50 and 0.5 plaque forming units respectively using the simple and the nested RT-PCR. The RT-PCR method was efficient for the detection of RVFV RNA in the blood from experimentally RVFV-infected mice and lamb and the nested RT-PCR was found more sensitive than the virus isolation method. Additionally, this detection method was applied successfully for the diagnosis of human cases during the 1998 Mauritanian outbreak. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",2001

The course of infection was monitored by clinical and parasitological examinations, haematological and serum protein analysis, and by anti-leishmania antibody levels. Two of the three amastigote-inoculated dogs developed a symptomatic infection with haematological and protein alterations, and a strong humoral immune response. The third dog was asymptomatic with no haematological or protein alterations and developed a steady humoral response. Four promastigote-inoculated dogs remained asymptomatic throughout the observation period, with only transient antibody responses to leishmanial antigen, and no haematological or protein alterations. The detection of the parasite in biological material obtained at necropsy showed that dogs with no clinical signs or other manifestations of disease may be infected. This indicates that asymptomatic carriers may be present in the canine population, but not identifiable by the usual serological tests, and suggests that epidemiological surveys based on serology may underestimate the prevalence of canine leishmaniosis and the parasite transmission risk.

When animals showed clinical signs of disease at 29, 37, 41 and 45 weeks post-infection (p.i.), they were treated with meglumine antimoniate (20.4 mg Sb/kg/12 h) subcutaneously for two periods of 10 days each. Sera were tested periodically for Leishmania antibodies by Dot-ELISA, ELISA and Western blot (WB). Aspirates of popliteal lymph node (PLN), peripheral blood sample (PB) and healthy skin were cultured in NNN and Schneider's medium. PLNs were positive between 8 and 20 weeks p.i. and in one animal PB was positive 6 weeks p.i. Samples of healthy skin, obtained before treatment, were also positive. Dot-ELISA and ELISA detected specific antibodies at an early stage between 4 and 12 weeks p.i and surpassed the cut-off between 16-24 weeks p.i., while the WE was positive between 10-19 weeks p.i. The pattern of bands revealed during the first stages of infection was variable and only in two cases did the positivity start with bands of low molecular weight (12-14 kD); the number of bands increased until 15-24 weeks p.i., after which sera revealed a complete pattern of bands, from 12 to 85 kD, in the antigen of Leishmania. After treatment the clinical improvement of the animals was accompanied by a decrease in antibody titers (Dot-ELISA and ELISA) although the parasites remained in the PLN. This was reflected in the WE by a decrease in the intensity of bands, especially those in the region of 12-30 kD. A new increase in the antibody levels between 3 and 5 months after terminating the therapy was detected in the WE by a restoration of the initial complete pattern of bands.

Calves were euthanatized on postinoculation day 51, and necropsy was performed. Results-Calves inoculated with EHDV-2 became infected, as evidenced by development of viremia and seroconversion. However, the virus did not cause detectable clinical disease, clinicopathologic abnormalities, or gross lesions. Viremia was prolonged despite development of a serum neutralizing antibody response.

Three calves received three sensitizing immunizations of inactivated BTV, 3 weeks apart. The BTV-sensitized animals, two non-sensitized BTV-seropositive and 4 BTV-seronegative control cattle, were challenge-exposed with BTV-11, UC8 strain. All cattle inoculated with inactivated BTV developed group-specific nonneutralizing and serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies. The development of post. challenge-exposure neutralizing antibody titers was inversely correlated with protective immunity. None of the BTV-challenged animals showed clinical disease. The levels of IgE were greatest in the sensitized calves after virus challenge in comparison with control groups. The sequential development, specificity and intensity of virus protein-specific humoral responses were evaluated using immunostaining. After challenge exposure of BTV sensitized and non-sensitized cattle, total and IgE antibodies reacted consistently with BTV structural proteins VP2, VP5 and VP7. Although no correlation was found between clinical disease and IgE, results add support to the hypothesis that IgE may be involved in the pathogenesis of clinical disease, since infection with BTV causes an increase in serum IgE levels. However, these results suggest that the levels of virus-specific reactivity may be an important factor in determining whether or not clinical disease manifestation occurs.

Based in both the importance of canids as reservoirs for the human disease and the fact that the canine disease may be an excellent model for the human condition, the present work has been conducted to analyze clinical and immune mechanisms associated with canine experimental leishmaniasis. Six-month-old mixed-breed dogs were intravenously infected with L. infantum promastigotes and the infection course was monitored along a 343 days-period. On day 75 post-infection (p.i.), amastigotes were observed in the lymph nodes of all dogs. The analysis of the humoral response against total L. infantum antigens by both ELISA and Western blotting evidenced a correlation between the levels of IgG isotypes (IgG1 and IgG2) and disease progression. It was observed that in those animals showing either a regressive or an oligosymptomatic form of the disease, the anti-Leishmania IgG1 antibodies were undetectable whereas those animals developing active disease showed high levels of anti-Leishmania IgG1 antibodies. Additionally, the time-course of antibody production against L. infantum recombinant antigens in the experimentally infected dogs has been analyzed. The present data suggest that reactivity against the heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) may be used as diagnostic marker of early steps of infection, and that the appearance of anti-histone antibodies is associated with progression of infection to disease status.

C ruminantium was isolated in bovine endothelial cell culture from the plasma of this animal during the febrile stage of the disease and transmitted to susceptible goats, causing fatal heartwater. The prevalence of C ruminantium infection in 292 ticks was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis to be 1.7 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval 0.71 to 4.0 per cent). A DNA probe analysis, which is less sensitive than PCR, detected infection in three of the five PCR-positive ticks.

Cross-infection experiments also were carried out to investigate the level of antibody cross-reactivity and cross-protection between the two viruses. The seroprevalence rate was high for both CVV (> 66%) and POTV (> 43%) in adult deer statewide. Antibodies neutralizing CVV were more common among deer harvested in the northern part of Indiana whereas the prevalence of POTV antibodies suggested a more southern distribution for this virus. Experimental infections of captive deer showed that they may serve as amplifying hosts for either virus. Deer infected with CVV or POTV developed a 1-3-day viremia with 3.0 and 4.1 log(10) plaque-forming units/ml mean peak titers, respectively. However, significant levels of antibody cross-reactivity between the two viruses were observed.

In an effort to clarify CCHF epidemiological significance in sheep, we studied the biological and clinical aspects of sheep experimentally infected with CCHF virus. West African sheep breeds were infected either by intraperitoneal inoculation or by infestation with experimentally CCHF-virus-infected ticks (Hyalomma truncatum). A total of 17 sheep including controls as well as 5 lambs from their progeny were monitored. A moderate but constant fever was observed (39.7 degrees C +/- 0.3) which correlates with the viraemia. Virus was reisolated from blood samples taken from day 3 to day 9 postinfection (p.i.) at a mean titre of 3.3 log LD50/ml. The virus was detected for a period of time of 7 days in non-immune sheep and for less than 4 days in previously immunized sheep. In non-immune sheep, antibody detected by ELISA showed an IgM response on day 7 p.i., followed by an IgG response one day later. Five infected sheep, surveyed for liver and kidney biological markers, showed hepatic dysfunction with a moderate serum aspartate transferase rise to 210 U/l. Out of four sheep tested for blood markers, two showed an abnormal blood cell count, with marked neutrophilia of up to 63% lasting for two weeks. Infected pregnant ewes produced antibodies in their milk at a significant titre (1:1,000), and antibodies were recovered in the sera of nursing lambs from their first meal to 50 days after birth. These findings are discussed; they demonstrate that, in spite of a high turnover of local sheep herds (median age of 3 years) and long-term CCHF antibody persistence (> 3 years), sheep can be infected and efficiently transmit the virus at least once in a lifetime.",1998

There was a decline in the titres of infectious bluetongue virus and of antigen in tissues collected between 7 and 12 days after infection. Conclusions The severity of disease was related to the speed of onset and duration of pyrexia and not the development or titre of viraemia. Generally, those animals with sensitive mouths, depression, coronitis, recumbency and reluctance to move were the most debilitated.

Parkhouse","Modulation of T cell and monocyte function in the spleen following infection of pigs with African swine fever virus","Infection of pigs with many strains of African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) has been shown to cause a loss or marked decrease in the ability of splenocytes to respond to mitogens. These observations have been extended by cell fractionation and reconstitution experiments to show that the mitogen stimulated proliferative capacity of both the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells is affected. Similarly, monocytes which are directly infectable by virus, are functionally defective as antigen presenting cells when added to mitogen stimulated normal T cells. Interestingly, the same T cells which respond poorly in mitogenic assays can be activated by stimulation through the CD3 receptor. In contrast to the defective mitogenic response of T cells, B cell function, as assessed by stimulation through the CD40 ligand in vitro remains intact. There is no evidence for apoptosis in either the T cells or the B cells recovered from the spleens of ASFV infected animals 1-5 days following infection. Although the number of leucocytes which can be recovered from the infected spleen decreases rapidly with progression of the disease, the proportion of the different cell phenotypes remains constant. Thus decreased activity of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissue from ASFV infected animals appears to be directly attributable to infection of the monocytes. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",1998

Five puppies were inoculated by ingestion of Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks experimentally infected with H. canis, and all became infected with H. canis: gametocytes were detected in blood smears from four dogs and schizonts were observed in the spleen and bone marrow of the fifth. Antibodies reactive with H. canis gametocytes were detected by the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA), with IgM detected initially in all dogs 16 to 39 days post infection (PI) and IgG 22 to 43 days PI. The presence of gametocytes was first observed within peripheral blood neutrophils in Giemsa-stained blood smears between days 28 and 43 PI. Gametocyte-reactive antibodies were detected before the appearance of blood gametocytes in three of the four parasitemic dogs and also in a dog with no observed parasitemia. The detection of serum antibodies prior to the detection of blood gametocytes, or without apparent parasitemia, suggests that antibodies reactive with gametocytes may be formed against earlier forms of the parasite developing in the parenchymal tissues. Sera of dogs experimentally infected with Babesia canis, Babesia gibsoni and Ehrlichia canis exhibited no reactivity when tested with H. canis antigen. Additionally, sera positive for H. canis were not reactive with antigens of Toxaplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Leishmania donovani and E. canis. In conclusion, inoculation of dogs with ticks infected with H. canis results in production of antibodies reactive with peripheral blood gametocytes. Detection of IgG titres would be beneficial for the diagnosis of progressive infections with undetectable parasitemia, for seroprevalence studies, and as an adjunct to IgM titres in early infections.

Animals-38 pregnant cows, 14 steers, and 10 lactating dairy cows. Procedure-Pregnant cows in their third, fifth, or eighth month of gestation were vaccinated (1 ml of RVF MP-12 containing 5 log(10) plaque-forming units [PFU] of virus) and were monitored daily through parturition for signs of disease, viremia, and immunologic response. Additionally, 10 vaccinated pregnant cows were challenge inoculated with virulent RVFV at postvaccination day (PVD) 30 and were monitored daily for untoward effects. Ten unvaccinated pregnant cows also were challenge inoculated with virulent RVFV and served as challenge controls. Vaccinated lactating dairy cows were monitored for viremia and virus shedding in the milk through PVD 14. Yearling steers were vaccinated to assess their immunologic response to various doses of vaccine and were challenge inoculated with virulent RVFV at PVD 28 to assess protection. Results-10 of 38 (26.3%) cows vaccinated during pregnancy developed transient postvaccination viremia titer greater than or equal to 2.5 log(10) PFU/ml of serum. All vaccinated cows delivered live, healthy calves that were RVFV seronegative al birth, but which quickly acquired colostral antibodies. Vaccinated cows and their fetuses were protected when challenge exposed with virulent RVFV at PVD 30, whereas unvaccinated pregnant cows inoculated with RVFV became febrile and viremic, and aborted. Vaccine virus was unsuccessfully sought from milk of lactating dairy cows after vaccination, suggesting that shedding of vaccine virus through milk should not be a concern. Steers, inoculated with tenfold escalating vaccine doses, beginning with 1.0 log(10) PFU, were protected against virulent RVFV challenge exposure. Conclusions-RVF MP-12 may be safe and efficacious for use in pregnant or lactating bovids, and a minimal dose of vaccine may provide suitable protection against viremia.",1997

We conducted 2 experimental trials in domestic swine using VSV-NJ isolated from a sand fly from Ossabaw Island to determine if route of inoculation or immunosuppression via steroid administration affected the development of disease, viremia, viral shedding, or the neutralizing antibody response. In a third trial, we studied the potential for contact transmission among swine using this isolate. Virus isolations were made from nasal cavity or palatine tonsil of the soft palate, and VSV-NJ neutralizing antibodies developed when pigs were inoculated intradermally in the apex of the snout, ear, or coronary band, intravenously, intranasally, or via scarification of the apex of the snout or coronary band. Vesicles developed only in pigs inoculated in the apex of the snout or coronary band, and these vesicles were at the site of inoculation. Steroid treatment did not potentiate the development of secondary vesicles and did not prolong the period of virus shedding from VSV-NJ-infected swine. Contact transmission, as determined by shedding of virus from the tonsil of the soft palate and the development of VSV-NJ neutralizing antibodies, occurred in pigs in contact with animals inoculated in the apex of the snout but not in contact animals exposed to pigs inoculated intradermally in the coronary band or intranasally. These trials show that contact transmission can occur and VSV-NJ can be shed without the development of clinical disease (i.e., vesicle formation).

Four blood preparations [whole blood, buffy coat, washed red blood cells (RBC) and plasma] taken pre-inoculation and on days 6 to 9 post-inoculation (PI) were used in the ELISA to study antigenaemia in forty sheep, each experimentally infected with one of 20 South African BTV serotypes. Seventeen of the 20 serotypes were detected and 27 of the 40 sheep were at some stage Ag-ELISA positive, Over the period of sampling, Ag-ELISA positive results were most frequently returned from whole blood taken on days 6 and 7 PI. However in some instances the quantity and/or duration of BTV antigenaemia was greater in buffy coat and washed RBC preparations. In a selection of samples examined, positive Ag-ELISA results were generally obtained when samples had an infectious virus titre in eggs of > 10(3.2) egg lethal doses (ELD(50)/ml). The appearance and duration of detectable antigenaemia was compared with the development of clinical signs and antibody responses of infected sheep. On days 6 and 7 PI the presence of fever (> 40 degrees C) was indicative to the likelihood of detectable antigenaemia After day 7 PI antigenaemia declined and clinical signs of swollen face and inflamed feet appeared together with the first detectable antibody response. The Ag-ELISA, when used in conjunction with clinical observations and serologic data, should be useful as a rapid diagnostic procedure for bluetongue disease.",1996

Virus was also isolated from tonsils collected at necropsy from 3 pigs from non-vaccinated and 1 pig from vaccinated sows. Vaccination of pregnant sows leads to development of maternal antibodies that are transmitted via colostrum to pigs and are protective against clinical EEEV related disease after experimental challenge with EEEV. In addition, vaccination prevents amplification of virus in infected pigs and could result in protection of animals and farm labor in the environment of infected pigs.",1996

Eight dogs were intravenously inoculated with 5 X 10(7) stationary phase promastigotes of Leishmania infantum (LEM 2002, ZMON-1). A further eight naturally infected dogs were diagnosed by parasitological and serological methods and selected according to their clinical and immunological condition. Clinical, hematological, pathological and parasitological examinations, including parasite burden and distribution, were included in the study. Antibody production was estimated by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunofluorescence assay techniques; the cellular immune response was studied by means of the skin test and the lymphocyte proliferation test. Experimentally infected dogs developed a chronic and progressive disease with the same clinical signs shown by naturally infected dogs. Both naturally and experimentally infected dogs developed the same histopathological reaction, but to differing degrees. Parasite burden and distribution were related to the extent of lesions, and were consequently less pronounced in experimentally infected dogs. The main feature of the immune response in experimental and natural infection was the lack of specific T-cell response to leishmanial antigen. Non-specific responses to mitogens were normal (i.e. as compared with healthy dogs) throughout the experimental infection, but were partially suppressed (65.3%) in naturally infected animals. A remarkable humoral response was evident in both natural and experimental infection: IgG-isotype antibodies were detected in experimental infection at 50-70 days post infection, and their production increased during the course of the infection. However, high titers were observed only in naturally infected dogs.",1995

In an effort to further evaluate the antiviral response of BTV-infected cattle, the role of the regional lymph node (LN) in the immune response of calves to BTV was characterized. Calves were inoculated with BTV in the skin of the neck in an area drained by the superficial cervical LN. Calves were euthanized at regular intervals after inoculation and both BTV-challenged and contralateral (control) superficial cervical LNs were harvested, In addition, some calves had cannulation of the superficial cervical efferent lymphatics prior to inoculation. Lymphocyte subpopulation analysis was done on LN cell suspensions and lymph cells using a panel of cell-specific monoclonal antibodies. There was a significant increase in the proportion of B cells in the challenged LN after inoculation as compared with the control LN. In addition, BTV-specific antibodies were detected in efferent lymph plasma from the challenged LN in one cannulated calf by 9 days after inoculation (DAI), as determined by competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas BTV-specific antibodies were not detected in serum from this calf through 12 DAI. Analysis of lymph cells revealed a sustained increase in cell output from the challenged LN due to an increase in lymphoblasts and CD8(+) T cells, In contrast, the cell output from the control LN dropped markedly by 8 DAI and there was no significant increase in any specific cell population. Double label analysis characterized lymphoblasts as activated CD8(+) cells, as determined by expression of MHC Class II antigens (CD8(+) MHC II+). These cells were only transiently present as CD8(+) MHC II+ cells were not identified in lymph from the challenged LN at 14 DAI. Few CD8(+) MHC II+ cells were identified at any time in lymph from the control LN or in lymph from a mock infected calf. The data indicate that B cell proliferation in the challenged LN and release of activated CD8(+) cells from this LN were specific responses to BTV infection. The rapid expansion of activated CD8(+) T cells indicates that these cells may limit early viral spread. It is concluded that the regional LN draining inoculated skin is critical to the immune response of calves to BTV infection.",1995

Selected bloods which were positive by PCR analysis but not by VI in ECE were not infectious for sheep. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that prolonged viremia in BTV-infected cattle results from association of the virus with blood cells, especially erythrocytes. The fact that calf blood that contained viral nucleic acid as determined by PCR analysis, but not infectious virus as determined by VI in ECE, was not infectious for either the insect vector or sheep suggests that cattle whose blood contains BTV nucleic acid but not infectious virus are unimportant to the epidemiology of BTV infection.",1994

The outcome of infection was assessed by isolation of parasites, serum antibody titers to Leishmania antigen, and development of clinical signs of leishmaniasis. Our studies show that 3 years after experimental infection, asymptomatic or resistant dogs responded to L. infantum antigen both in lymphocyte proliferation assays in vitro and in delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction, whereas no serum antibodies to parasite antigen were shown. In contrast, symptomatic or susceptible animals failed to respond to parasite antigen in cell-mediated assays both in vitro and in vivo and showed considerably higher serum antibodies to leishmanial antigens. In addition, significantly higher level of interleukin 2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor were found in supernatants from stimulated peripheral mononuclear cells from asymptomatic dogs compared with those from symptomatic and control uninfected dogs. IL-6 production did not vary significantly among the groups studied. Finally, we observed similar results with a group of mixed-breed dogs with natural Leishmania infections also grouped as asymptomatic or symptomatic on the basis of clinical signs of canine visceral leishmaniasis. These results demonstrate that serum antibody titers, antigen-specific proliferative responses, delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions, and IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor production by peripheral mononuclear cells can be used as markers of disease progression.",1994

MacLachlan","Dynamics of viral spread in bluetongue virus infected calves","The kinetics of viremia and sites of viral replication in bluetongue virus (BTV) infected calves were characterized by virus isolation, serology and immunofluorescence staining procedures. In addition, the role of the regional lymph node and lymphatics draining inoculated skin in the pathogenesis of BTV infection was determined by analyzing efferent lymph collected from indwelling cannulas. Viremia persisted for 35 to 42 days after inoculation (DAI) and virus co-circulated with neutralizing antibodies for 23 to 26 days. Virus was first isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear (PBM) cells at 3 DAI, after stimulation of PBM cells with interleukin 2 and mitogen. BTV was frequently isolated from erythrocytes, platelets and stimulated PBM cells but never from granulocytes and rarely from plasma during viremia. Virus was consistently isolated from erythrocytes late in the course of viremia. Interruption of efferent lymph flow by cannulation delayed the onset of viremia to 7 DAI. BTV was infrequently isolated from lymph cells, and few fluorescence positive cells were observed after lymph and PBM cells were labelled with a BTV-specific monoclonal antibody. Virus was isolated from spleen by 4 DAI and most tissues by 6 DAI, whereas virus was isolated from bone marrow only at 10 DAI. Virus was not isolated from any tissue after termination of viremia. It is concluded that primary viral replication occurred in the local lymph node and BTV then was transported in low titer to secondary sites of replication via infected lymph and PBM cells. We speculate that virus replication in spleen resulted in release of virus into the circulation and non-selective infection of blood cells which disseminated BTV to other tissues. Virus association with erythrocytes likely was responsible for prolonged viremia, although infected erythrocytes eventually were cleared from the circulation and persistent BTV infection of calves did not occur.",1994

We have studied the effects of infection with three cell culture passaged variants of AHS virus in naive North American horses.

A second variant, AHS/9PI, resulted in signs and lesions typical of the cardiac form of AHS: pericardial effusion, subendocardial hemorrhage and widespread subcutaneous edema. Mortality was approximately 70%. The third variant, AHS/4PI, produced mild to subclinical disease in horses, usually expressed only as transient mild fever. No mortality occurred in horses due to infection with AHS/4PI. All surviving infected animals did, however, seroconvert with both neutralizing and ELISA-reactive antibodies.

In this study, RBCs from bluetongue (BLU) virus-infected sheep were adsorbed directly onto Formvar-coated, gold electron microscope grids. 3. Cytoskeletons were prepared and then probed using a monoclonal antibody to VP 7, a structural BLU-virus protein and Protein-A gold. 4. Of the ca 32,000 RBCs that were examined from BLU virus-infected sheep, 34 (0.106%) contained labelled BLU virus particles. 5. No labelled particles were observed in any of ca 8000 RBCs taken prior to BLU virus inoculation of sheep. 6. If the antigenic BLU virus particles (which may be viral cores) are in fact infectious, this method of sequestration of virus within RBCs could contribute to the prolonged viremia typical of this arboviral disease, which is known to occur concurrently with circulating neutralizing antibody.",1992

Two strains of bluetongue virus serotype 11 designated as UC-2 and UC-8 have different virulence patterns in newborn mice. These viruses have distinctly different electropherotype patterns on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicating a genetic difference in these two viruses of the same serotype. Four bovine fetuses each were inoculated intramuscularly with either UC-2 or UC-8, and one fetus was inoculated with placebo. The inoculation was made intramuscularly through the uterine wall at 120 days' gestation, and the bovine fetuses were recovered by cesarean section 12 or 20 days after inoculation. Fetal blood was collected for virus isolation and serology. Virus was reisolated from brain, blood, lung and liver. Both strains, UC-2 and UC-8, cause severe lesions in the 120 day fetuses. The encephalomalacic lesions occurred earlier and were more severe in fetuses inoculated with UC-8 as compared to those inoculated with UC-2. The subtle differences observed in the fetuses inoculated with the two different strains suggest that there is a difference in pathogenic potential of the two viruses. These differences do not appear to be completely dependent upon the host species.",1992

Thirty-eight animals responded clinically and detailed haematological and serological data were obtained from 10 of them. Inappetence was the only clinical sign observed before the onset of fever. The temperature response was characteristically biphasic, with the second peak occurring 12 to 24 hours after the first. The only consistent haematological response was an increase in the numbers of circulating neutrophils with a concurrent decline in the numbers of mononuclear leucocytes. There were no detectable changes in plasma or blood volume, packed cell volume, red cell count, haemoglobin concentration, serum calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and creatinine concentrations, or aspartate aminotransferase activity. Viraemia was demonstrated on either the first or second day of clinical disease and lasted for at most 48 hours. Low levels of neutralising antibody could be detected within one or two days after the cessation of viraemia. Six antibody-free animals did not respond clinically to injection with virulent virus, and did not develop detectable viraemia or a serum neutralising antibody response.",1990

The most frequent post-mortem lesion was haemorrhage in the visceral lymph nodes. Other lesions included excess fluid in the abdominal cavity and petechial haemorrhages in the kidneys.

Production of BTV proteins in mononuclear cell cultures was detected by immune precipitation of viral proteins from [35S]methionine-labelled extracts of these cells, by immunofluorescence staining of cells using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to BTV proteins VP7 and NS2, and by flow cytometry with MAbs to VP2, VP7, NS1 and NS2. BTV-infected cells were most numerous in cultures of adherent mononuclear cells; infected cells were initially identified as monocytes on the basis of their morphology, and size and scatter characteristics as determined by analysis with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). The majority of adherent mononuclear cells with these scatter characteristics were confirmed to be monocytes by FACS analysis with a MAb specific for bovine monocytes. Identification of BTV-infected adherent mononuclear cells as monocytes was further established by double immunofluorescent labelling, as infected adherent cells reacted with the MAb specific for bovine monocytes, and with another MAb specific for class II antigen. Infection of adherent mononuclear cells was also confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, as BTV virions and tubules were present in lysates of cultures of BTV-infected adherent mononuclear cells and within the cytoplasm of adherent cells. In contrast, BTV proteins were detected in few cells identified as lymphocytes on the basis of their scatter characteristics, and mean fluorescence of such cells was considerably less than that of BTV-infected monocytes. Viraemia persisted until 35 days after inoculation of a colostrum-deprived calf inoculated with BTV. Virus was isolated from blood mononuclear cells at 1 week after infection of the calf, but not thereafter. BTV infection of blood mononuclear cells was demonstrated until 9 days after inoculation by indirect immunofluorescence staining of mononuclear cells. In contrast, virus was consistently isolated from erythrocyte-enriched preparations throughout viraemia in titres comparable to those in whole blood. These results indicate that although bovine monocytes are readily infected in vitro with this strain of BTV serotype 10, infection of blood monocytes is unlikely to be responsible for the prolonged viraemia that consistently occurs in BTV-infected cattle.",1989

Acute illness began on postinoculation day (PID) 4 and continued to PID 11, and pigs were febrile, with maximal infective ASFV titers detected in blood. By PID 11, initial antibody titers to ASFV antigens were detected in plasma. The WBC numbers were maintained near preinoculation counts; however, lymphocyte counts decreased slightly with a compensatory increment in neutrophil and monocyte numbers. From PID 11 to PID 25, rectal temperatures gradually returned to preinoculation values, titers of viremia began to decrease, plasma antibody to ASFV antigens increased to peak titers, and WBC numbers increased slightly. Percentages of lymphocytes returned to preinoculation values, neutrophil percentages decreased to slightly below preinoculation values, monocyte percentages were mildly increased, and eosinophil percentages were unaffected.

Seven of 11 sows that were not killed had aborted. The pathogenesis of the abortions was studied, using virus isolation, tissue immunofluoresence, and histopathologic techniques. African swine fever virus was recovered from 179 of 1,329 (13.5%) fetal tissues tested. The 3 fetal tissues most frequently yielding virus were the fetal placenta, amniotic fluid, and fetal heart blood. Virus was not recovered from fetal tissues obtained from 2 of the aborting sows. Direct immunofluorescent microscopy for ASF viral antigen was done on approximately 1,175 fetal tissues. Although brightly fluorescing cells were common in maternal tissues, specific immunofluorescence was present in only placental tissues from 2 sows. Microscopic lesions in fetal tissues were inconsistent and included mild focal placentitis, mild heptic degeneration and necrosis, and mild interstitial pneumonia. These changes were not considered to be sufficiently specific to have diagnostic significance. In marked contrast to these changes in the fetal tissues, maternal tissues had high titers of virus, with marked necrosis of lymphoid tissues, and contained many cells with ASF viral antigen. We conclude that specific diagnosis of abortion resulting from ASF infection should, therefore, be based on examination of maternal tissues, rather than fetal tissues. The pregnancy failure seems to result from the effects of the virus infection on the dam more so than from direct viral damage to the placenta or fetus.",1987

All 6 pigs developed high viremias between 4 and 18 days post-inoculation (DPI) which became undetectable by 32 to 46 DPI. Virus was found in erythrocytes, plasma, and mononuclear leucocytes from peripheral blood. Overall, virus infection had only minor effects on the number of circulating leucocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. At the early acute phase of infection slight neutrophilia and lymphocytopenia were observed with mildly elevated monocyte numbers and slightly depressed neutrophil numbers that continued from the time of evident reduction in viremia to beyond the period of viral clearance. The infected pigs readily produced high titers of ASF virus antibody shortly after the onset of viremia. No significant differences in LP responses of MNL from the 6 pigs to PHA-P, Con-A and PWM were observed after infection when compared to those obtained with MNL from normal pigs. The in vitro addition of infectious ASF virus to MNL from normal pigs did not affect LP responses to any of the three mitogens.

A systemic lymphoreticular hyperplasia was observed in the dead lambs and in all lambs at 12 weeks of age; in 4 of the latter, granulomatous reactions were present in the liver and kidney. Lungs of the full-term lambs were reduced in weight and showed poor alveolar development and mononuclear cell infiltration, which persisted in the 12-week-old lambs. It was concluded that bluetongue virus is capable of causing not only gross abnormalities of the CNS, but also generalized growth retardation and fetal lymphoreticular hyperplasia.",1985

Thrombocytopenia was detected by postinoculation days (PID) 7 and 8, and antiviral antibody was detected by PID 7, using an indirect immunofluorescence technique. The total hemolytic complement concentration was moderately and transiently decreased from PID 5 to 9, but was consistently low from PID 18 to 26.

Antibody to ASF virus was not detected in pigs inoculated with the more virulent isolate. Pigs sensitized to ASF viral antigen with an inactivated-virus vaccine or by previous infection with ASF were challenge exposed. Sensitized pigs became clinically ill and thrombocytopenic by 24 to 72 hours earlier than did inoculated, nonsensitized pigs. Vaccinated pigs inoculated with homologous virus had lower blood virus concentrations than did nonvaccinated pigs. African swine fever virus-sensitized pigs inoculated with heterologous virus had a higher fatality rate than did nonsensitized pigs, and the pigs died peracutely, with only a few gross lesions in evidence. In vitro experiments demonstrated that ASF virus antigen induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma from recovered, nonviremic pigs.

These calves remained latently infected, and BTV was transmitted from each calf to sheep by bites of the biting gnats. Most of the BTV biological recovery attempts resulted in suspicious BT clinical responses in sheep, but without viral isolation. However, after challenge exposure with the homologous virus, 5 of 7 recipient sheep bitten by the gnats reacted with an intensified BT clinical response that indicated viral sensitization. One calf was born weak, never attained a healthy appearance, was latently infected with BTV, and had fluctuating BTV neutralizing antibody titers.

Both strains were found to be approximately equal in their ability to infect donkeys. However, a quantity as small as 50% hamster intraperitoneal infectious units of strain V-38 resulted in fatal infection. On the other hand, as much as 631 million infectious units of strain P676 were nonfatal in one of two donkeys. It appears that strain V-38 is approximately 100 million times more virulent than strain P676 in equine species.

Rodents were highly susceptible to VE infection and circulated VE virus at levels ranging from 10(7.7) to 10(11.5) suckling mouse intracranial lethal doses per ml for 2 to 4 days. These levels of virus could easily infect vector mosquitoes. Mortality was high in all species of rodents except Sigmodon hispidus, adult Neotoma micropus, and adult Peromyscus leucopus. Lagomorphs were susceptible to VE infection but circulated VE virus at or near mosquito threshold levels for 1 day only. Raccoons and opossums were relatively resistant to VE infection or circulated low levels of virus in the blood. Juvenile animals of four species were more susceptible and experienced higher viremias than did adults. In two of the four, mortality was higher in the juveniles than in adults. A consideration of results obtained during this study and those of other investigators led to the conclusion that equines were of major importance, that canines, lagomorphs and rodents were of minor importance, and that other species tested were of no importance as virus amplifiers in VE epizootics.",1976

Tissue samples were taken from individual animals killed at daily intervals over a period of 11 days. The mean incubation time was 6.9 days and the first clinical sign was pyrexia. On the 4th day, bluetongue virus was demonstrated in the lymph nodes of the cephalic area, tonsils and spleen; viraemia became demonstrable on the 6th day post-inoculation and typical macroscopic lesions due to the virus were first observed on the 8th day. It was concluded that, post-infection, the virus entered the regional lymph nodes. From there it was disseminated via the lymph and/or the blood stream to the lymphoid tissues in other parts of the body where further replication occurred. From these primary sites the virus was carried via the blood stream and infected the majority of tissues. Humoral antibody, as detected by immunofluorescence, did not appear to have a direct influence on the concentration of virus in solid tissues. Persistence of the virus in infected sheep was not demonstrated when tissues were taken 6, 8 and 16 weeks after infection.",1976

These infected blood samples represented 3 different BT virus types: 4, 10 and 16. Three identical experiments were performed, one with each of the 3 different virus types. Ten-fold dilutions of the infected blood samples were prepared and 1 ml of each blood dilution was inoculated IV into series of 10 to 12-month old susceptible sheep; at the same time 0.1 ml of each dilution was inoculated IV into series of 10 to 13-day-old chicken embryos. The virus titre was found to be similar when assayed in the two host systems. There was no correlation between the amount of virus inoculated and the severity of symptoms in the inoculated sheep. The virus content in daily blood samples collected from the experimental sheep was assayed by IV inoculation of CE. Virus was isolated from all the reacting sheep and was detected sometimes as early as 1 day PI and as late as 30 days PI. A high titre of log10 4.0 to 7.0 per 1 ml of blood was recorded during several consecutive days before and after the onset of clinical signs. There seemed to be an inverse ratio between the amount of virus inoculated and the number of days the virus persisted in the bloodstream. The neutralisation index in day 22 serum samples was 3.5 to 4.5. Virus was isolated from some of the reacting sheep on the day that these antibody levels were recorded. Since the comparative simultaneous titrations of BT virus in sheep and in CE yielded similar results, the IV inoculation of CE is advocated as the routine method to be employed for laboratory diagnosis of this disease.",1975

The third calf which had a low level of maternal antibody remained healthy and developed antibody that became undetectable after 6 months. Bovine ephemeral fever virus strain 525 was reisolated from the brains of both dead calves by intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice. Homogenates that were prepared from the brains of the calves failed to produce disease or to induce antibody formation in susceptible calves when inoculated intravenously. Strain 525 of BEF virus has been shown to possess a degree of neurovirulence for laboratory animals that has not been reported for other strains (Tzipori and Spradbrow 1974). Although this strain is unable to produce viraemia in calves after I/V inoculation, the present study shows that strain 525 can multiply in the brain tissues of calves and cause death after I/C inoculation.",1975

Infected deer had an increase in total erythrocyte counts as well as corresponding changes in erythrocyte-associated values. Although the percentage of neutrophiles in the blood increased during infection, total leukocyte counts remained unchanged. Virus was isolated during the clinical illness from 13 of 16 organs tested. No viral antigen was demonstrated in any tissue by the direct fluorescent antibody technique.

The causative agent is a virus which is readily filterable and is capable of storage, either frozen or in glycerol, for relatively long periods of time. It produces a solid immunity in the few animals that survive and the blood sera of such convalescent animals contain virus-neutralizing antibodies. The disease is one in which large and small hemorrhages occur in both the viscera and skeletal structures of the body, as well as in the subcutaneous tissues.

It is unrelated to epidemic hemorrhagic fever of man or to the disease caused in horses by the equine arteritis virus. At least two serologically different types of EHD virus exist.

Studies of the EEE infection thresholds [ R.A.E., B 44 38] of many different species of mosquitos [44 401 indicated that Aedes sollicitans (WIk.) was one of the most susceptible, with a probable threshold of about 10- 3, and TenBroek & Merrill reported in 1935 that they had transmitted infection from horse to horse with this mosquito. Quantitative studies were therefore made to determine more accurately its capabilities in spreading EEE infection among horses. Six batches of 50-80 normal females were fed, at a time when temperatures indicated that viraemia was high, on a horse that had been inoculated with 25, 000 mouse intracerebral LD50's of EEE virus. The titre of virus circulating in its blood reached 10 5.5, a level not commonly attained in horses, but it recovered. After 11-12 days' incubation, ten mosquitos from each batch were ground individually and inoculated into mice. From the fate of the mice two days later, it was estimated that from 10 to 40-50 per cent. of the mosquitos in the six batches were infected. Up to 500 times as much virus as the amount ingested was recovered from some of the mosquitos. Mosquitos of five out of the six batches transmitted the infection to chicks. They had fed on the horse when the titre of virus in its blood was 10- 4.8 or more, whereas the batch that did not transmit had fed when the titre was 10 -4.4. Ou the 14th day of incubation, 29 mosquitos from one of the most heavily infected groups were refed on a normal horse. This horse developed a fatal infection, but its blood had a lower, more usual titre of virus, not rising above 10 -3.2. Attempts to infect more mosquitos by allowing them to feed on it were unsuccessful, possibly because times of feeding were based on temperature, and titres had fallen to 10 2-.2 or less when temperature was highest. In the presence of large numbers of low-threshold rnosquitos and a high percentage of non-immune horses and birds, an occasional horse infective for mosquitos could be of significance in an epizootic [44 39].",1956

Less than 10 mouse LD(50) of LCM virus was sufficient to induce multiplication in the eye, whereas, approximately 1000 LD(50) of SFV was required to initiate infection. Both viruses multiplied in the rabbit eye as an inapparent infection. Little or no virus could be recovered from the optic nerves or brains of the rabbits, although virus was present in high titer in the eyes. The animals showed no signs of illness other than a transitory fever. Large amounts of SFV induced a severe iritis followed by corneal opacity. This reaction appeared to be due to ""toxic"" properties of the virus. No ocular reactions have been observed with LCM virus other than a mild transitory hyperemia. The yield of virus from the eye following inoculation of large amounts of SFV was less than when more dilute inocula were used. Maximum multiplication of both viruses occurred about 48 hours after inoculation into the vitreous. SFV remained in high titer for about 4 days and thereafter could be recovered in variable amounts up to about 5 weeks after inoculation. LCM virus could be recovered in gradually decreasing amounts up to about 3 weeks after inoculation. Serum-neutralizing antibodies appeared in high titer (neutralization index up to 3000) following inoculation of SFV into the rabbit eye. However, only traces of antibody could be detected in extracts of the eyes. SFV was obtained irregularly and in low titer from the aqueous humor following inoculation into either the vitreous or anterior chamber. No significant difference in the virus content of the vitreous, an extract of the retinal cells, and an extract of the whole eye could be detected 48 hours after inoculation of SFV into the vitreous. The Lansing strain of poliomyelitis virus failed to cause any detectable reaction in the rabbit eye and no evidence of multiplication of the virus was obtained in these experiments.",1950

Researchers attribute this variability in clinical manifestations to the ability of the immune response to limit pathogen multiplication and dissemination, which is, in part, likely determined by the immune response genes. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that MHC class II genes are associated with disease outcome of experimental L. infantum infection in Beagles. Dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) class II haplotypes were characterised by sequence-based typing of Beagle dogs experimentally infected with L. infantum during vaccine challenge studies. Variability of response to infection was determined by clinical score, serology and quantification of L. infantum DNA in the bone marrow over the study period. Dogs showed limited DLA diversity and the DLA profiles of dogs recruited for the different vaccine challenge studies differed. There were variable responses to infection, despite the apparent restriction in genetic diversity. One haplotype DLA-DRB1*001:02–DQA1*001:01–DQB1*002:01 was associated with increased anti-Leishmania antibodies in one infection model, but no DLA associations were found in other groups or with parasite load or clinical score. Examination of this particular DLA haplotype in a larger number of dogs is required to confirm whether an association exists with the immune or clinical responses to L. infantum infection. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018

Beer","Bluetongue virus serotype 27: Experimental infection of goats, sheep and cattle with three BTV-27 variants reveal atypical characteristics and likely direct contact transmission BTV-27 between goats","Bluetongue virus (BTV) hitherto consisted of 26 recognized serotypes, of which all except BTV-26 are primarily transmitted by certain species of Culicoides biting midges. Three variants of an additional 27th bluetongue virus serotype (BTV-27v01-v03) were recently detected in asymptomatic goats in Corsica, France, 2014–2015. Molecular characterization revealed genetic differences between the three variants. Therefore, in vivo characteristics were investigated by experimental infection of a total of 15 goats, 11 sheep and 4 cattle with any one of the three variants in separated animal trials. In goat trials, BTV-naïve animals of the same species were kept in a facility where direct contact was unhindered. Of the 15 inoculated goats, 13 and 14 animals were found positive for BTV-RNA and antibodies (Ab), respectively, until the end of the experiments. Surprisingly, BTV-Ab levels as measured with ELISA and neutralization test (SNT) were remarkably low in all seropositive goats. Virus isolation from whole-blood was possible at the peak of viremia until 49 dpi. Moreover, detection of BTV-27v02-RNA and Ab in one contact goat indicated that—similar to BTV-26—at least one of three BTV-27 variants may be transmitted by contact between goats. In the field, BTV-27 RNA can be detected up to 6 months in the whole-blood of BTV-27-infected Corsican goats. In contrast, BTV RNA was not detected in the blood of cattle or sheep. In addition, BTV-27 Abs were not detected in cattle and only a transient increase in Ab levels was observed in some sheep. None of the 30 animals showed obvious BT-like clinical signs. In summary, the phenotypes observed for BTV-27v01-v03 phenotypes correspond to a mixture of characteristics known for BTV-25 and 26. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2018

Kortekaas","Transmission of Rift Valley fever virus from European-breed lambs to Culex pipiens mosquitoes","Background: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne bunyavirus of the genus Phlebovirus that is highly pathogenic to ruminants and humans. The disease is currently confined to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but globalization and climate change may facilitate introductions of the virus into currently unaffected areas via infected animals or mosquitoes. The consequences of such an introduction will depend on environmental factors, the availability of susceptible ruminants and the capacity of local mosquitoes to transmit the virus. We have previously demonstrated that lambs native to the Netherlands are highly susceptible to RVFV and we here report the vector competence of Culex (Cx.) pipiens, the most abundant and widespread mosquito species in the country. Vector competence was first determined after artificial blood feeding of laboratory-reared mosquitoes using the attenuated Clone 13 strain. Subsequently, experiments with wild-type RVFV and mosquitoes hatched from field-collected eggs were performed. Finally, the transmission of RVFV from viremic lambs to mosquitoes was studied. Principal findings: Artificial feeding experiments using Clone 13 demonstrated that indigenous, laboratory-reared Cx. pipiens mosquitoes are susceptible to RVFV and that the virus can be transmitted via their saliva. Experiments with wild-type RVFV and mosquitoes hatched from field-collected eggs confirmed the vector competence of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from the Netherlands. To subsequently investigate transmission of the virus under more natural conditions, mosquitoes were allowed to feed on RVFV-infected lambs during the viremic period. We found that RVFV is efficiently transmitted from lambs to mosquitoes, although transmission was restricted to peak viremia. Interestingly, in the mosquito-exposed skin samples, replication of RVFV was detected in previously unrecognized target cells. Significance: We here report the vector competence of Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from the Netherlands for RVFV. Both laboratory-reared mosquitoes and well as those hatched from field-collected eggs were found to be competent vectors. Moreover, RVFV was transmitted efficiently from indigenous lambs to mosquitoes, although the duration of host infectivity was found to be shorter than previously assumed. Interestingly, analysis of mosquito-exposed skin samples revealed previously unidentified target cells of the virus. Our findings underscore the value of including natural target species in vector competence experiments. © 2017 Vloet et al.",2017

Gazzinelli, H.M.D. Andrade","Canine visceral leishmaniasis follow-up: a new anti-IgG serological test more sensitive than ITS-1 conventional PCR","Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease with dogs serving as reservoirs for one of its etiological agents, Leishmania infantum. In Brazil, VL control involves culling of seropositive dogs, among other actions. However, the most employed serological tests lack accuracy, and are not able to detect canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) during the early stages of infection. Early detection of CVL is highly desirable in order to shorten the contact time between the infected reservoirs and the vectors. In this study, we investigated the ability of two multiepitope proteins, PQ10 and PQ20, to detect CVL at earlier stages than currently employed methods, including ITS-1 conventional PCR. Using serum samples from naturally infected dogs, we observed that ELISA-PQ10 and ELISA-PQ20 were able to detect Leishmania infection at earlier time points as compared with kDNA PCR-RFLP in anti-IgG and anti-IgM assays. Using sera from experimentally infected dogs, we monitored seroconversion using multiepitope proteins, ELISA-crude antigen, as well as ITS-1 conventional and real-time PCR. While seroconversion was detected by ELISA-crude antigen in 16.6% of the dogs, multiepitope proteins were able to detect seroconversion in more than 80% of them. Moreover, the ability of ELISA-PQ10 and ELISA-PQ20 to detect Leishmania infection at earlier time points as compared with conventional PCR was also confirmed in experimental infection dogs’ sera. Immunofluorescence to Babesia canis and Ehrlichia canis did not show cross-reactions with ELISA-PQ10/PQ20 positive samples. Results of real-time PCR and ELISA with multiepitope proteins were very similar, with concordances between 80 and 100%. Furthermore, our findings indicated that PQ10 and PQ20 immunoassays can be related to parasite load. ELISA-PQ10 and ELISA-PQ20 are more sensitive diagnostic tools for early CVL detection as compared with other methods They could potentially be used in screening tests due to easy execution and low costs facilities. © 2017",2017

Blome","Biological characterization of African swine fever virus genotype II strains from north-eastern Estonia in European wild boar","Due to its impact on animal health and pig industry, African swine fever (ASF) is regarded as one of the most important viral diseases of pigs. Following the ongoing epidemic in the Transcaucasian countries and the Russian Federation, African swine fever virus was introduced into the Estonian wild boar population in 2014. Epidemiological investigations suggested two different introductions into the southern and the north-eastern part of Estonia. Interestingly, outbreak characteristics varied considerably between the affected regions. While high mortality and mainly virus-positive animals were observed in the southern region, mortality was low in the north-eastern area. In the latter, clinically healthy, antibody-positive animals were found in the hunting bag and detection of virus was rare. Two hypotheses could explain the different behaviour in the north-east: (i) the frequency of antibody detections combined with the low mortality is the tail of an older, so far undetected epidemic wave coming from the east, or (ii) the virus in this region is attenuated and leads to a less severe clinical outcome. To explore the possibility of virus attenuation, a re-isolated ASFV strain from the north-eastern Ida-Viru region was biologically characterized in European wild boar. Oronasal inoculation led to an acute and severe disease course in all animals with typical pathomorphological lesions. However, one animal recovered completely and was subsequently commingled with three sentinels of the same age class to assess disease transmission. By the end of the trial at 96 days post-initial inoculation, all animals were completely healthy and neither virus nor viral genomes were detected in the sentinels or the survivor. The survivor, however, showed high antibody levels. In conclusion, the ASFV strain from north-eastern Estonia was still highly virulent but nevertheless, one animal recovered completely. Under the experimental conditions, no transmission occurred from the survivor to susceptible sentinel pigs. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2017

One such protein is DP148R. We showed that the DP148R gene is transcribed at early times postinfection. Deletion of this gene did not reduce virus replication in macrophages, showing that it is not essential for replication in these cells. However, deletion of this gene from a virulent isolate, Benin 97/1, producing the BeninΔDP148R virus, dramatically reduced the virulence of the virus in vivo. All pigs infected with the BeninΔDP148R virus survived infection, showing only transient mild clinical signs soon after immunization. Following challenge with the parental virulent virus, all pigs immunized by the intramuscular route (11/11) and all except one immunized by the intranasal route (5/6) survived. Mild or no clinical signs were observed after challenge. As expected, control nonimmune pigs developed signs of acute African swine fever (ASF). The virus genome and infectious virus were observed soon after immunization, coincident with the onset of clinical signs (~106 genome copies or 50% tissue culture infective doses/ml). The levels of the virus genome declined over an extended period up to 60 days postimmunization. In contrast, infectious virus was no longer detectable by days 30 to 35. Gamma interferon (IFN-γ) was detected in serum between days 4 and 7 postimmunization, and IFN-γ-producing cells were detected in all pigs analyzed following stimulation of immune lymphocytes with whole virus.

While prospective clinical and immunological assessments of dogs experimentally challenged with L. infantum have been previously reported over a relatively short follow-up period, the long-term characterization of infected animals has not been performed to date. We evaluated dogs in a subclinical state for six years following experimental infection with L. infantum and Lu. longipalpis saliva, via an intradermal route, to characterize clinical, parasitological and immunological parameters arising from L. infantum experimental infection. We also assess these parameters in a group of naturally infected animals. The immune profiles of the experimentally and naturally infected animals exhibited increases of IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-18, and decreases in TNF, IL-2, IL-8 and CXCL1, compared to controls. Our results indicate that over a six-year follow-up post-challenge, subclinically infected dogs presented low CVL clinical scores despite the persistence of Leishmania parasites in the lymph nodes, spleen and skin. Similarities observed among immune profiles in the context of experimental and natural infection seem to suggest that an enduring activation of the host immune response may lead to the control of parasite growth, thereby limiting disease severity. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017

Rodríguez","BA71ΔCD2: A new recombinant live attenuated African swine fever virus with cross-protective capabilities","African swine fever is a highly contagious viral disease of mandatory declaration to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). The lack of available vaccines makes its control difficult; thus, African swine fever virus (ASFV) represents a major threat to the swine industry. Inactivated vaccines do not confer solid protection against ASFV. Conversely, live attenuated viruses (LAV), either naturally isolated or obtained by genetic manipulation, have demonstrated reliable protection against homologous ASFV strains, although little or no protection has been demonstrated against heterologous viruses. Safety concerns are a major issue for the use of ASFV attenuated vaccine candidates and have hampered their implementation in the field so far. While trying to develop safer and efficient ASFV vaccines, we found that the deletion of the viral CD2v (EP402R) gene highly attenuated the virulent BA71 strain in vivo. Inoculation of pigs with the deletion mutant virus BA71ΔCD2 conferred protection not only against lethal challenge with the parental BA71 but also against the heterologous E75 (both genotype I strains). The protection induced was dose dependent, and the cross-protection observed in vivo correlated with the ability of BA71ΔCD2 to induce specific CD8+ T cells capable of recognizing both BA71 and E75 viruses in vitro. Interestingly, 100% of the pigs immunized with BA71ΔCD2 also survived lethal challenge with Georgia 2007/1, the genotype II strain of ASFV currently circulating in continental Europe. These results open new avenues to design ASFV cross-protective vaccines, essential to fight ASFV in areas where the virus is endemic and where multiple viruses are circulating. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.",2017

Since then, the disease has continued to spread within these regions, and recently, cases were reported in the Czech Republic and Romania. Currently, there is an increasing risk of ASFV introduction into Western Europe. Hence, there is an urgent need to assess current contingency plans. For this purpose, knowledge of modes-of-transmission and clinical outcome in pigs infected with new European ASFV strains is needed. In the present study, two experiments were conducted in pigs using an isolate of ASFV from Poland (designated here POL/2015/Podlaskie/Lindholm). In both studies, pigs were inoculated intranasally with the virus and contact pigs were exposed to the experimentally infected pigs, either directly (contact within and between pens) or by air. Pigs exposed to the virus by intranasal inoculation, by direct contact to infected animals and by aerosol developed acute disease characterized by viremia, fever and depression. Infectious virus was first detected in blood obtained from the inoculated pigs and then sequentially among the within-pen, between-pen and air-contact pigs. ASFV DNA and occasionally infectious virus was found in nasal-, oral-, and rectal swabs obtained from the pigs, and ASFV DNA was detected in air samples. No anti-ASFV antibodies were detected in sera. In conclusion, the study shows that the currently circulating strain of ASFV can be efficiently transmitted via direct contact and by aerosols. Also, the results provide quantitative transmission parameters and knowledge of infection stages in pigs infected with this ASFV. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2017

It is speculated that infection of pregnant dams may also lead to a significant number of unrecognized fetal losses during the early period of gestation. To assess the pathogenic effects of SBV infection of goats in early pregnancy, we inoculated dams at day 28 or 42 of gestation and followed the animals until day 55 of gestation. Viremia in the absence of clinical signs was detected in all virus-inoculated goats. Fetal deaths were observed in several goats infected at day 28 or 42 of gestation and were invariably associated with the presence of viral genomic RNA in the affected fetuses. Among the viable fetuses, two displayed lesions in the central nervous system (porencephaly) in the presence of viral genome and antigen. All fetuses from goats infected at day 42 and the majority of fetuses from goats infected at day 28 of gestation contained viral genomic RNA. Viral genome was widely distributed in these fetuses and their respective placentas, and infectious virus could be isolated from several organs and placentomes of the viable fetuses. Our results show that fetuses of pregnant goats are susceptible to vertical SBV infection during early pregnancy spanning at least the period between day 28 and 42 of gestation. The outcomes of experimental SBV infection assessed at day 55 of gestation include fetal mortalities, viable fetuses displaying lesions of the central nervous system, as well as viable fetuses without any detectable lesion. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2017

Here we describe a system for monitoring animal activity based on video and data processing techniques, in order to detect slowdown and weakening due to infection with African swine fever (ASF), one of the most significant threats to the pig industry. The system classifies and quantifies motion-based animal behaviour and daily activity in video sequences, allowing automated and non-intrusive surveillance in real-time. The aim of this system is to evaluate significant changes in animals’ motion after being experimentally infected with ASF virus. Indeed, pig mobility declined progressively and fell significantly below pre-infection levels starting at four days after infection at a confidence level of 95%. Furthermore, daily motion decreased in infected animals by approximately 10% before the detection of the disease by clinical signs. These results show the promise of video processing techniques for real-time early detection of livestock infectious diseases. © 2017 Fernández-Carrión et al.

To identify the pathogenicity of one of these strains, we infected adult goats with AKAV-7 via different routes. Twenty-five female goats were used in this study and were divided into five groups: intracerebral (IC) and intrasubarachnoid (IS) viral inoculation (n = 8 each), intravenous (IV) inoculation (n = 4), and vaccinated before IV inoculation (n = 4), in addition to a negative control animal. All animals inoculated with AKAV-7 had AKAV-neutralizing antibodies at 6–8 days post infection (dpi). During the experimental period, infected animals showed no clinical signs. In the IC group, 5/8 goats had non-suppurative encephalomyelitis affecting the cerebrum. Virus S RNA segments were detected in nearly all areas of the brain. In the IS group, 3/8 goats had encephalomyelitis affecting the cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord. At 7 and 21 dpi, virus S RNA segments were found mostly in the spinal cord, especially around the area of injection (L5–L6). Antibody titres in the serum of the vaccinated group had an early onset and slightly increased titre compared with the IV group. Histopathologically, there were no obvious lesions in the central nervous tissues in the vaccinated group, while one of four goats in the IV group showed encephalomyelitis in the parietal lobe of the cerebrum. The newly isolated AKAV-7 can cause encephalomyelitis in goats after experimental injection. The attenuated AKAV vaccine currently used in Korea may provide partial protective immunity against AKAV-7 infection, but the real effect of the vaccine requires further investigation in goats. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017

For development of a safe attenuated vaccine, we previously established an efficient reverse genetics (RG) system to generate Entry Competent Replication-Abortive (ECRA) virus strains, for all nine serotypes and demonstrated the vaccine potential of these strains in type I interferon receptor (IFNAR)-knockout mice. Here, we evaluated the protective efficacies of these ECRA viruses in AHSV natural hosts. One monoserotype (ECRA.A4) vaccine and one multivalent cocktail (ECRA.A1/4/6/8) vaccine were tested in ponies and subsequently challenged with a virulent AHSV4. In contrast to control animals, all vaccinated ponies were protected and did not develop severe clinical symptoms of AHS. Furthermore, the multivalent cocktail vaccinated ponies produced neutralizing antibodies against all serotypes present in the cocktail, and a foal born during the trial was healthy and had no viremia.

Since 2006, several serotypes including BTV-1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9 and 16, have spread from the Mediterranean basin into Northern Europe for the first time. BTV-8 in particular, caused a major epidemic in northern Europe. As a result, it is evident that most European countries are at risk of BTV infection. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay based on TaqMan technology for the detection of representative strains of all BTV serotypes. Primers and probes were based on genome segment 10 of the virus, the NS3 gene. The assay was tested for sensitivity, and specificity. The analytical sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assay was 200 copies of RNA per reaction. The assay did not amplify the closely related orbivirus epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) but successfully detected all BTV reference strains including clinical samples from animals experimentally infected with BTV-8.

The magnitude of these secondary responses can also affect the CD8 and CD4 epitope repertoire diversity. Bluetongue virus (BTV) infection in sheep elicits a T cell response that contributes to viremia control and could be relevant for cross-protection between BTV serotypes. Here, we characterized CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses during primary and recall responses. During primary immune responses, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations expanded by 14 days post-infection (dpi). CD4+ T cell populations showed a lower peak of expansion and prolonged contraction phase compared to CD8+ T cell populations. Recall responses to BTV challenge led to BTV-specific expansion and activation of CD8+ but not of CD4+ T cells. The evolution of the BTV-specific TCR repertoire was also characterized in response to VP7 peptide stimulation. Striking differences in repertoire development were noted over the time-course of infection. During primary responses, a broader repertoire was induced for MHC-I and MHC-II epitopes. However, during memory responses, a narrowed repertoire was activated towards a dominant motif in VP7 comprising amino acids 139-291. Monocytes were also examined, and expanded during acute infection resolution. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels increased after BTV inoculation and persisted throughout the experiment, indicative of a prolonged inflammatory state during BTV infections. These findings could have implications for vaccine design as the narrowing memory T cell repertoire induced after BTV re-infection could lead to the development of protective immunodominant TCR repertoires that differs between individual sheep. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017

Although birds are reservoirs, pigs play a role as amplifying hosts, and are affected in particular through reproductive failure. Here, we show that a lentiviral JEV vector, expressing JEV prM and E proteins (TRIP/JEV.prME), but not JEV infection induces strong antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activities for infection of macrophages. Such antibodies strongly promoted infection via Fc receptors. ADE was found at both neutralizing and non-neutralizing serum dilutions. Nevertheless, in vivo JEV challenge of pigs demonstrated comparable protection induced by the TRIP/JEV.prME vaccine or heterologous JEV infection. Thus, either ADE antibodies cause no harm in the presence of neutralizing antibodies or may even have protective effects in vivo in pigs. Additionally, we found that both pre-infected and vaccinated pigs were not fully protected as low levels of viral RNA were found in lymphoid and nervous system tissue in some animals. Strikingly, the virus from the pre-infection persisted in the tonsils throughout the experiment. Finally, despite the vaccination challenge, viral RNA was detected in the oronasal swabs in all vaccinated pigs. These latter data are relevant when JEV vaccination is employed in pigs. © 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2017

HLH is often triggered by viral infection. The aim of this study was to ascertain the features of HLH involvement in African swine fever virus (ASFV) (genotype II) pathogenesis. Methods The serum levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), as well as the histological constitution (for hemophagocytic macrophages detection) of various organs of pigs infected with ASFV genotype II were investigated. The diagnosis of HLH was made according to universally accepted human criteria. Results The association of fever, cytopenias, splenomegaly, and hemophagocytosis was present in 87.5% of the infected pigs (absence of hyperthermia in one of eight pigs). Marked hypertriglyceridemia was observed at 3–4 days post infection. Previously it was shown that ASFV induced a significant decrease in the level of fibrinogen from day 5 till the end of experiment. Progression of the HLH coincided with a temporary increase in the serum levels of MCSF levels (early stage of disease) and GMCSF levels (2–3 pays post infection). Conclusions Hemophagocytic syndrome should be suspected in ASFV (genotypeII) infected pigs. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2017

As the first signs of animal infection are usually fever and reduced motion that lead to reduced consumption of water and feed, we developed a novel smart system to monitor body temperature and motion in real time, facilitating the early detection of infectious diseases. In this study, carried out within the framework of the European Union research project Rapidia Field, we tested the smart system on 10 pigs experimentally infected with two doses of an attenuated strain of African swine fever. Biosensors and an accelerometer embedded in an eartag captured data before and after infection, and video cameras were used to monitor the animals 24 h per day. The results showed that in 8 of 9 cases, the monitoring system detected infection onset as an increase in body temperature and decrease in movement before or simultaneously with fever detection based on rectal temperature measurement, observation of clinical signs, the decrease in water consumption or positive qPCR detection of virus. In addition, this decrease in movement was reliably detected using automatic analysis of video images therefore providing an inexpensive alternative to direct motion measurement. The system can be set up to alert staff when high fever, reduced motion or both are detected in one or more animals. This system may be useful for monitoring sentinel herds in real time, considerably reducing the financial and logistical costs of periodic sampling and increasing the chances of early detection of infection. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2017

Animals were allocated in 4 groups: Cy (cyclophosphamide), BT (bluetongue), CyBT (combined Cy and BT) and Co (control), and underwent clinical evaluations, virological testing, peripheral blood immunophenotyping and determination of antiviral humoral immune responses. Intravenous administration of cyclophosphamide (37.5 mg/kg body weight) resulted in immunosuppresion induction, as significant drops were observed in blood leukocytes and lymphocyte subset counts (CD2+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+), lasting 3–10 days after its administration. Reduction in B-cell (CD19+) counts was more pronounced than in T-/NK-cell (CD2+) counts (92% and 59%, respectively). BTV-9 inoculation resulted in pronounced lymphocytopenia observed from day 1 post-inoculation. Their combined administration resulted in a more intense immunosuppressive effect, as indicated by the greater reduction in lymphocyte, granulocyte, CD4+ and CD8+ cell counts. In group CyBT, earlier initiation of fever by one day (day 6 p.i.) compared to group BT (day 7 p.i.), and delay in antibody responses by one day was observed, compared to group BT. Neutralizing antibodies in both groups (BT, CyBT) were detectable from day 10 p.i., but no significant titer differences were observed. Infectious virus titers were detected from day 4 p.i. in group BT and from day 3 in group CyBT. Statistical significances in virus titers were also observed (greatest mean titer difference: 1.4 log10 CEID50/ml RBCs at day 5 p.i., P &lt; 0.001), indicating possible impact of immunosuppression on virus transmission and epidemiology of bluetongue. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017

Ten naive pigs were placed in contact with eight pigs experimentally inoculated with the Lithuanian LT14/1490 ASF virus (ASFV) responsible for the first ASF case detected in wild boar in Lithuania in January 2014. Clinical examination and rectal temperature were recorded each day. Blood sampling from every animal was carried out twice weekly. Blood samples were examined for presence of ASF virus-specific antibodies and for determining the ASFV viral load. From the obtained results, it was concluded that the Lithuanian ASFV induced an acute disease which resulted in 94, 5% mortality. The disease was easily detected by real-time PCR prior to the onset of clinical signs and 33% of the animals seroconverted. All findings were in accordance with observations previously made in domestic pigs and wild boar when infected with ASF genotype II viruses characterized by a high virulence. One in-contact pig remained asymptomatic and survived the infection. The role of such animals in virus transmission would need further investigation. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2017

Transient moderate virus genome levels were detected in blood samples after challenge that decreased, but persisted until the end of the experiment in some animals. In contrast, pigs immunised intramuscularly with low and moderate doses (103 and 104 TCID50) displayed lower percentages of protection (50–66%), and low or undetectable levels of virus genome were detected in blood samples throughout the study. In addition, clinical courses observed in protected pigs were asymptomatic.

Yet, the main focus of WNV research remains on the pathogenesis of encephalitic disease, mainly conducted in mouse models. We characterized host responses during subclinical WNV infection in horses and compared outcomes with those obtained in a novel rabbit model of subclinical WNV infection (Suen et al. 2015. Pathogens, 4: 529). Experimental infection of 10 horses with the newly emerging WNV-strain, WNVNSW2011, did not result in neurological disease in any animal but transcriptional upregulation of both type I and II interferon (IFN) was seen in peripheral blood leukocytes prior to or at the time of viremia. Likewise, transcript upregulation for IFNs, TNFα, IL1β, CXCL10, TLRs, and MyD88 was detected in lymphoid tissues, while IFNα, CXCL10, TLR3, ISG15 and IRF7 mRNA was upregulated in brains with histopathological evidence of mild encephalitis, but absence of detectable viral RNA or antigen. These responses were reproduced in the New Zealand White rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) experimentally infected with WNVNSW2011 by intradermal footpad inoculation. Kinetics of the anti-WNV antibody response was similar in horses and rabbits, which for both species may be explained by the early IFN and cytokine responses evident in circulating leukocytes and lymphoid organs. Given the similarities to the majority of equine infection outcomes, immunocompetent rabbits appear to represent a valuable small-animal model for investigating aspects of non-lethal WNV infections, notably mechanisms involved in abrogating morbidity. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2017

Using three alpacas as model-organisms for dromedary camels, the safety, immunogenicity and pathogenicity of the MP-12 vaccine were evaluated in this study. To compare both acute and subacute effects, animals were euthanized at 3 and 31 days post infection (dpi). Clinical monitoring, analysis of liver enzymes and hematological parameters demonstrated the tolerability of the vaccine, as no significant adverse effects were observed. Comprehensive analysis of serological parameters illustrated the immunogenicity of the vaccine, eliciting high neutralizing antibody titers and antibodies targeting different viral antigens. RVFV was detected in serum and liver of the alpaca euthanized 3 dpi, whereas no virus was detectable at 31 dpi. Viral replication was confirmed by detection of various RVFV-antigens in hepatocytes by immunohistochemistry and the presence of mild multifocal necrotizing hepatitis. In conclusion, results indicate that MP-12 is a promising vaccine candidate but still has a residual pathogenicity, which requires further investigation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2017

Outbreaks have been controlled successfully by vaccination, however, currently available BT vaccines have several shortcomings. Recently, we have developed BT Disabled Infectious Single Animal (DISA) vaccines based on live-attenuated BTV without expression of dispensable non-structural NS3/NS3a protein. DISA vaccines are non-pathogenic replicating vaccines, do not cause viremia, enable DIVA and are highly protective. NS3/NS3a protein is involved in virus release, cytopathogenic effect and suppression of Interferon-I induction, suggesting that the vaccination route can be of importance. A standardized dose of DISA vaccine for serotype 8 has successfully been tested by subcutaneous vaccination. We show that 10 and 100 times dilutions of this previously tested dose did not reduce the VP7 humoral response. Further, the vaccination route of DISA vaccine strongly determined the induction of VP7 directed antibodies (Abs). Intravenous vaccination induced high and prolonged humoral response but is not practical in field situations. VP7 seroconversion was stronger by intramuscular vaccination than by subcutaneous vaccination. For both vaccination routes and for two different DISA vaccine backbones, IgM Abs were rapidly induced but declined after 14 days post vaccination (dpv), whereas the IgG response was slower. Interestingly, intramuscular vaccination resulted in an initial peak followed by a decline up to 21 dpv and then increased again. This second increase is a steady and continuous increase of IgG Abs. These results indicate that intramuscular vaccination is the optimal route. The protective dose of DISA vaccine has not been determined yet, but it is expected to be significantly lower than of currently used BT vaccines. Therefore, in addition to the advantages of improved safety and DIVA compatibility, the novel DISA vaccines will be cost–competitive to commercially available live attenuated and inactivated vaccines for Bluetongue. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2017

The control of African swine fever (ASF) has been hampered by the unavailability of vaccines. Successful experimental vaccines have been derived from naturally occurring, cell culture-adapted, or genetically modified live attenuated ASFV. Recombinant viruses harboring engineered deletions of specific virulence-associated genes induce solid protection against challenge with parental viruses. Deletion of the 9GL (B119L) gene in the highly virulent ASFV isolates Malawi Lil-20/1 (Mal) and Pretoriuskop/96/4 (δ9GL viruses) resulted in complete protection when challenged with parental isolates. When similar deletions were created within the ASFV Georgia 2007 (ASFV-G) genome, attenuation was achieved but the protective and lethal doses were too similar. To enhance attenuation of ASFV-G, we deleted another gene, UK (DP96R), which was previously shown to be involved in attenuation of the ASFV E70 isolate. Here, we report the construction of a doublegene- deletion recombinant virus, ASFV-G-δ9GL/δUK. When administered intramuscularly (i.m.) to swine, there was no induction of disease, even at high doses (106 HAD50). Importantly, animals infected with 104 50% hemadsorbing doses (HAD50) of ASFV-G-δ9GL/δUK were protected as early as 14 days postinoculation when challenged with ASFV-G. The presence of protection correlates with the appearance of serum anti-ASFV antibodies, but not with virus-specific circulating ASFV-specific gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-producing cells. ASFV-G-δ9GL/δUK is the first rationally designed experimental ASFV vaccine that protects against the highly virulent ASFV Georgia 2007 isolate as early as 2 weeks postvaccination. © 2016 American Society for Microbiology.",2017

Since peripheral blood cells are important mediators for vaccines, we study the impact of ASF on blood parameters in pigs with different ages and infected with different doses of ASF virus. Four different groups were studied: (1) 12 weeks of age/low virus dose; (2) 12 weeks of age/high virus dose; (3) 18 weeks of age/low virus dose; and (4) 18 weeks of age/high virus dose. By varying in age and/or ASFV inoculation dose, we monitor blood parameters during different degrees of disease. Thirty percent of the pigs survived the infection with a moderately virulent strain of African swine fever virus (ASFV). Animals that did survive infection were generally older, independent from the inoculation dose used. A firm reduction in many different cell types at 3-5 days postinfection (DPI) was accompanied by an increase in body temperature, followed by clinical signs and mortality from day 6 PI. While blood parameters generally normalized in survivors, γδ T cells and IL-10 levels could be related to mortality.

In this study we verified in sheep, using one commercially available inactivated vaccine for BTV-8 (BTVPUR AlSap 8), when, during the recommended vaccination schedule, animals start to be effectively protected against challenge with wild-type strain. To this aim, sheep were challenged at different time points shortly after the first vaccine injection. Twenty-four Sarda sheep were divided into four groups vaccinated two weeks before challenge (Group A), one week before challenge (Group B) and concurrently with challenge (Group C). A second vaccine was performed twenty-eight days later with respect the first vaccine administration in each experimental group. The last group consisted of six non vaccinated-infected animals (NVIA). Virological and serological examinations were performed before and after challenge up to 42 and 77 days post challenge, respectively. The results of the study show that vaccination commenced as little as two weeks before challenge (Group A) prevented viremia and RNAemia in challenged sheep altogether. Conversely, Group B was partially protected from challenge and Group C showed viraemia and RNAemia similar to NVIA. This study indicates that the first administration of inactivated vaccine performed two weeks before challenge was able to prevent viraemia. Overall, our findings may have direct consequences for the management of an unexpected BTV-8 outbreak in sheep and for the legislation on sheep trade from BTV restriction areas. © 2016 The Authors",2017

Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, humoral immune response and protective efficacy of binary ethylenimine (BEI) inactivated montanide adjuvanted pentavalent (BTV 1, 2, 10, 16 and 23) vaccine was evaluated in sheep against challenge with homologous serotypes in their respective group. Results: All sheep were seronegative at day 0 before vaccination. After first vaccination, mean PI value was gradually declined in all vaccinated sheep. Vaccinated sheep were seroconverted to bluetongue virus starting from 10 days of primary vaccination (DPV) with Mean±SD PI value of 36.05±10.78 and log10 Mean±SD neutralizing antibody slightly increased from 0.85-1.42 starting from 3-21 days of post primary vaccination while, unvaccinated group of sheep had Mean±SD PI value of 111.79±12.36 and no log10 serum neutralizing antibody at this point of time. At 28 Days Post Vaccination (DPV), all vaccinated animals registered an abrupt increment in antibody level. Strong seropositivity was remained up to the date of 49 DPV steadily in all vaccinated sheep. After challenge at 49 DPV, vaccinated sheep registered high level of group specific antibody and neutralizing antibody. This level persisted up to 180 days and declined slowly to 270 days post vaccination whereas, unvaccinated challenged showed seropositivity between 7-14 DPC which started to decline after 21 DPC. Increased level of rectal temperature (Mean = 40.8°C) and clinical signs were evident between 5-13 days post challenge in control animals. There was significant difference (p<0.05) between vaccinated and unvaccinated animals in the Mean±SD PI value, log10 Mean±SD of neutralizing antibody, mean rectal temperature and development of clinical signs after homologues virus challenge. However, there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in all above parameters due to variability of challenge virus serotypes. Conclusion: All the findings, clearly suggested that binary ethylenimine (BEI) inactivated montanide adjuvanted pentavalent bluetongue vaccine was effective in protecting sheep from BTV 1, 2, 10, 16 and 23 infections. © 2017 Molalegne Bitew et al.",2017

We used bluetongue virus (BTV) and its natural sheep host to reveal a previously uncharacterized mechanism used by an arbovirus to manipulate host immunity. Our study shows that BTV, similarly to other antigens delivered through the skin, is transported rapidly via the lymph to the peripheral lymph nodes. Here, BTV infects and disrupts follicular dendritic cells, hindering B-cell division in germinal centers, which results in a delayed production of high affinity and virus neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, the humoral immune response to a second antigen is also hampered in BTV-infected animals. Thus, an arbovirus can evade the host antiviral response by inducing an acute immunosuppression. Although transient, this immunosuppression occurs at the critical early stages of infection when a delayed host humoral immune response likely affects virus systemic dissemination and the clinical outcome of disease.",2016

There is no vaccine to prevent the disease and current control measures are limited to culling and restricting animal movement. Swine infected with attenuated strains are protected against challenge with a homologous virulent virus, but there is limited knowledge of the host immune mechanisms generating that protection. Swine infected with Pretoriuskop/96/4 (Pret4) virus develop a fatal severe disease, while a derivative strain lacking virulence-associated gene 9GL (Pret4∆9GL virus) is completely attenuated. Swine infected with Pret4∆9GL virus and challenged with the virulent parental virus at 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 days post infection (dpi) showed a progressive acquisition of protection (from 40% at 7 dpi to 80% at 21 and 28 dpi). This animal model was used to associate the presence of host immune response (ASFV-specific antibody and interferon (IFN)-γ responses, or specific cytokine profiles) and protection against challenge. With the exception of ASFV-specific antibodies in survivors challenged at 21 and 28 dpi, no association between the parameters assessed and protection could be established. These results, encompassing data from 65 immunized swine, underscore the complexity of the system under study, suggesting that protection relies on the concurrence of different host immune mechanisms. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2016

These genes have been implicated in the modulation of the type I interferon (IFN) response. We investigated the effect of modulating the IFN response on virus attenuation and induction of protective immunity by deleting genes MGF360 (MGF360-10L, 11L, 12L, 13L, 14L) and MGF530/505 (MGF530/505-1R, 2R and 3R) and interrupting genes (MGF360-9L and MGF530/505-4R) in the genome of the virulent ASFV isolate Benin 97/1. Replication of this deletion mutant, BeninΔMGF, in porcine macrophages in vitro was similar to that of the parental virulent virus Benin 97/1 and the natural attenuated isolate OURT88/3, which has a similar deletion of MGF360 and 530/505 genes. Levels of IFN-β mRNA in macrophages infected with virulent Benin 97/1 isolate were barely detectable but high levels were detected in macrophages infected with OURT88/3 and intermediate levels in macrophages infected with BeninΔMGF. The data confirms that these MGF360 and MGF530/505 genes have roles in suppressing induction of type I IFN. Immunisation and boost of pigs with BeninΔMGF showed that the virus was attenuated and all pigs (5/5) were protected against challenge with a lethal dose of virulent Benin 97/1. A short transient fever was observed at day 5 or 6 post-immunisation but no other clinical signs. Following immunisation and boost with the OURT88/3 isolate 3 of 4 pigs were protected against challenge. Differences were observed in the cellular and antibody responses in pigs immunised with BeninΔMGF compared to OURT88/3.

KUW2010/02 has been isolated in mammalian cells but is not replicating in Culicoides cells. TOVhas been detected in goats but could not been cultured, although TOV has been successfully passed to naïve animals by experimental infection using viremic blood. Genome segments Seg-2[VP2], Seg-6[VP5], Seg-7[VP7], and Seg-10[NS3/NS3a] expressing the respective TOV proteins were incorporated in BTV using reverse genetics, demonstrating that these TOV proteins are functional in BTV replication. Depending on the incorporated TOV proteins, in vitro replication is, however, decreased compared to the ancestor BTV, in particular by TOV-VP5. Sheep and goats were experimentally infected with BTV expressing both outer capsid proteins VP2 and VP5 of TOV, so-named ‘TOV-serotyped BTV’. Viremia was not detected in sheep, and hardly detected in goats after infection with TOV-serotyped BTV. Seroconversion by cELISA, however, was detected, suggesting that TOV-serotyped BTV replicates in small ruminants. One goat was coincidentally pregnant, and the fetus was strong PCR-positive in blood samples and several organs, which conclusively demonstrates that TOV-serotyped BTV replicates in vivo. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2016

Control of the disease has been hampered by the unavailability of vaccines. We recently reported the development of two experimental vaccine strains (ASFV-G-δ9GL and ASFV-G-δMGF) based on the attenuation of the highly virulent and epidemiologically relevant Georgia2007 isolate. Deletion of the 9GL gene or six genes of the MGF360/505 group produced two attenuated ASFV strains which were able to confer protection to animals when challenged with the virulent parental virus. Both viruses, although efficient in inducing protection, present concerns regarding their safety. In an attempt to solve this problem we developed a novel virus strain, ASFV-G-δ9GL/δMGF, based on the deletion of all genes deleted in ASFV-G-δ9GL and ASFV-G-δMGF. ASFV-G-δ9GL/δMGF is the first derivative of a highly virulent ASFV field strain subjected to a double round of recombination events seeking to sequentially delete specific genes. ASFV-G-δ9GL/δMGF showed a decreased ability to replicate in primary swine macrophage cultures relative to that of ASFV-G and ASFV-G-δMGF but similar to that of ASFV-G-δ9GL. ASFV-G-δ9GL/δMGF was attenuated when intramuscularly inoculated into swine, even at doses as high as 106 HAD50. Animals infected with doses ranging from 102 to 106 HAD50 did not present detectable levels of virus in blood at any time post-infection and they did not develop detectable levels of anti-ASFV antibodies. Importantly, ASFV-G-δ9GL/δMGF does not induce protection against challenge with the virulent parental ASFV-G isolate. Results presented here suggest caution towards approaches involving genomic manipulations when developing rationally designed ASFV vaccine strains. © 2016.",2016

L. infantum). A vaccine against canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) would be an important tool for decreasing the anxiety related to possible L. chagasi infection and for controlling human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Because the sand fly salivary proteins are potent immunogens obligatorily codeposited during transmission of Leishmania parasites, their inclusion in an anti-Leishmania vaccine has been investigated in past decades. We investigated the immunogenicity of the ""LbSapSal"" vaccine (L. braziliensis antigens, saponin as adjuvant, and Lutzomyia longipalpis salivary gland extract) in dogs at baseline (T0), during the post-vaccination protocol (T3rd) and after early (T90) and late (T885) times following L. chagasi-challenge. Our major data indicated that immunization with ""LbSapSal"" is able to induce biomarkers characterized by enhanced amounts of type I (tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-a, interleukin [IL]-12, interferon [IFN]-?) cytokines and reduction in type II cytokines (IL-4 and TGF-ß), even after experimental challenge. The establishment of a prominent pro-inflammatory immune response after ""LbSapSal"" immunization supported the increased levels of nitric oxide production, favoring a reduction in spleen parasitism (78.9%) and indicating long-lasting protection against L. chagasi infection. In conclusion, these results confirmed the hypothesis that the ""LbSapSal"" vaccination is a potential tool to control the Leishmania chagasi infection. © 2016 Resende et al.

One group received a commercial inactivated BTV serotype 8 (BTV8) vaccine. This group and the non-vaccinated group of calves were challenged twice (4 months apart) with the European BTV8 strain isolated during the 2006-2007 epidemics. Calves were then infected with a BTV1 inoculum which was found to be unexpectedly contaminated by BTV serotype 15 (BTV15). BTV1 and BTV15 single infections were performed on two other groups of three BTV naïve calves. A severe clinical picture was obtained after superinfection with BTV1/BTV15 in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals and after challenge with BTV8 in non-vaccinated animals. BTV1 and BTV15 single infection caused only very slight clinical signs. After superinfection and at the viraemic peak, there were an average of above 1000 times more BTV15 genomic copies than BTV1 ones. BTV1 RNA could be detected only in the spleen of one calf whereas BTV15 RNA was found in 15 organs of seven different animals. BTV8 immunization whether it was acquired through vaccination and challenges or challenges alone did not change BTV1 or BTV15 RNA detection in superinfected animals. However in these animals a partial cross neutralization between BTV8 and BTV1 might be involved in the lower BTV1 replication versus BTV15. Infection with different serotypes can occur also in the field. Interference between virus strains, genetic reassortment and cross-protection were considered as mechanisms to explain the clinical outcomes and the other virological and immunological findings in the course of BTV1/BTV15 superinfection. © 2016 The Author(s).",2016

Rock","African swine fever virus serotype-specific proteins are significant protective antigens for African swine fever","African swine fever (ASF) is an emerging disease threat for the swine industry worldwide. No ASF vaccine is available and progress is hindered by lack of knowledge concerning the extent of ASFV strain diversity and the viral antigens conferring type-specific protective immunity in pigs. Available data from vaccination/challenge experiments in pigs indicate that ASF protective immunity may be haemadsorption inhibition (HAI) serotype-specific. Recently, we have shown that two ASFV proteins, CD2v (EP402R) and C-type lectin (EP153R), are necessary and sufficient for mediating HAI serological specificity (Malogolovkin et al., 2015).. Here, using ASFV inter-serotypic chimeric viruses and vaccination/challenge experiments in pigs, we demonstrate that serotype-specific CD2v and/or C-type lectin proteins are important for protection against homologous ASFV infection. Thus, these viral proteins represent significant protective antigens for ASFV that should be targeted in future vaccine design and development. Additionally, these data support the concept of HAI serotype-specific protective immunity. © 2016 The Authors.",2016

In the current study, we observed that MVEV infection induced high IFNα, TNFα, IL6, and CXCL10 transcript levels in the brains of weanling NZWRs, unlike infection with the less virulent WNVNSW2011. These transcript levels also correlated with encephalitis severity. Widespread STAT1 protein expression in brain with moderate neuropathology suggests that IFN-I signaling is crucial for limiting neural infection and mediating non-lethal neuropathogenesis. Unlike NZWRs, CTRs limit neuroinvasion without upregulation of many cytokine/chemokine transcripts, suggesting a species-dependent virus control mechanism. However, the common IFNγ, TNFα and IL6 transcript upregulation in specific lymphoid organs suggest some conserved elements in the response against flaviviruses, unique to all rabbits. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",2016

In 2010, there was a major outbreak of encephalomyelitis in Korea and fifteen AKAV strains, including AKAV-7, were isolated from cows. To identify the neuropathogenicity of AKAV-7, we performed experimental infection of cows. Six-month-old female Korean Holstein dairy cattle were inoculated with AKAV-7 by various routes, including intracerebral (IC), intrasubarachnoid space (IS), subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV); a separate group was vaccinated before intravenous infection. Five of the six cows in the IC group and two of the six cows in the IS group showed clinical signs such as locomotor ataxia and paralysis of the hind limbs. Three of six cows died after IC infection 9-12 days post infection (dpi). Histopathologic changes such as nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis were confirmed in various parts of the central nervous system in the IC, IS and SC groups. Early onset of neutralizing antibodies in the serum and lower viral mRNA levels in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and various tissues in the vaccinated group was noticeable compared to the unvaccinated group (IV group). We suggest that the AKAV vaccine currently used in Korea may be partially effective for protection against AKAV-7 in cows. © 2016 The Author(s).",2016

There are conflicting reports on the role of interferon in ASFV infection. We therefore analysed the interaction of ASFV with porcine interferon, in vivo and in vitro. Virulent ASFV induced biologically active IFN in the circulation of pigs from day 3-post infection, whereas low virulent OUR T88/3, which lacks genes from multigene family (MGF) 360 and MGF505, did not. Infection of porcine leucocytes enriched for dendritic cells, with ASFV, in vitro, induced high levels of interferon, suggesting a potential source of interferon in animals undergoing acute ASF. Replication of OUR T88/3, but not virulent viruses, was reduced in interferon pretreated macrophages and a recombinant virus lacking similar genes to those absent in OUR T88/3 was also inhibited. These findings suggest that as well as inhibiting the induction of interferon, MGF360 and MGF505 genes also enable ASFV to overcome the antiviral state. © 2016.",2016

Here, we infected 8 beagles through multiple experimental vector transmissions with Leishmania infantum-infected Lutzomyia longipalpis. CanL clinical signs varied, although live parasites were recovered from all dog spleens. Splenic parasite burdens correlated positively with Leishmania-specific interleukin 10 levels, negatively with Leishmania-specific interferon γ and interleukin 2 levels, and negatively with Leishmania skin test reactivity. A key finding was parasite persistence for 6 months in lesions observed at the bite sites in all dogs. These recrudesced following a second transmission performed at a distal site. Notably, sand flies efficiently acquired parasites after feeding on lesions at the primary bite site. In this study, controlled vector transmissions identify a potentially unappreciated role for skin at infectious bite sites in dogs with CanL, providing a new perspective regarding the mechanism of Leishmania transmissibility to vector sand flies. © The Author 2016.

Although only 5 serotypes of BTV are considered endemic to the United States, as many as 11 incursive serotypes have been detected in livestock and wildlife in the past 16 years. Introductions of serotypes, with unknown virulence and disease risk, are constant threats to US agriculture. One potential incursive serotype of particular concern is the European strain of BTV-8, which was introduced into Northern Europe in 2006 and caused unprecedented livestock disease and mortality during the 2006-2007 vector seasons. To assess disease risk of BTV-8 in a common white-faced American sheep breed, eight Polled Dorset yearlings were experimentally infected and monitored for clinical signs. Viremia and viral tissue distribution were detected and quantified by real-time qRT-PCR. Overall, clinical disease was moderate with no mortality. Viremia reached as high as 9.7 log10 particles/mL and persisted at 5 logs or higher through the end of the study (28 days). Virus distribution in tissues was extensive with the highest mean titers at the peak of viremia (day 8) in the kidney (8.38 log10 particles/mg) and pancreas (8.37 log10 particles/mg). Virus persisted in tissues of some sheep at 8 logs or higher by day 28. Results of this study suggest that should BTV-8 emerge in the United States, clinical disease in this common sheep breed would likely be similar in form, duration, and severity to what is typically observed in severe outbreaks of endemic serotypes, not the extraordinary disease levels seen in Northern Europe. In addition, a majority of exposed sheep would be expected to survive and act as significant BTV-8 reservoirs with high titer viremias for subsequent transmission to other livestock and wildlife populations. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",2016

Richt","Experimental infection of calves by two genetically-distinct strains of rift valley fever virus","Recent outbreaks of Rift Valley fever in ruminant livestock, characterized by mass abortion and high mortality rates in neonates, have raised international interest in improving vaccine control strategies. Previously, we developed a reliable challenge model for sheep that improves the evaluation of existing and novel vaccines in sheep. This sheep model demonstrated differences in the pathogenesis of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) infection between two genetically-distinct wild-type strains of the virus, Saudi Arabia 2001 (SA01) and Kenya 2006 (Ken06). Here, we evaluated the pathogenicity of these two RVFV strains in mixed breed beef calves. There was a transient increase in rectal temperatures with both virus strains, but this clinical sign was less consistent than previously reported with sheep. Three of the five Ken06-infected animals had an early-onset viremia, one day post-infection (dpi), with viremia lasting at least three days. The same number of SA01-infected animals developed viremia at 2 dpi, but it only persisted through 3 dpi in one animal. The average virus titer for the SA01-infected calves was 1.6 logs less than for the Ken06-infected calves. Calves, inoculated with either strain, seroconverted by 5 dpi and showed time-dependent increases in their virus-neutralizing antibody titers. Consistent with the results obtained in the previous sheep study, elevated liver enzyme levels, more severe liver pathology and higher virus titers occurred with the Ken06 strain as compared to the SA01 strain. These results demonstrate the establishment of a virulent challenge model for vaccine evaluation in calves. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2016

However, the expressions of IFN-γ and TNF-α are up-regulated in the tissues and plasma of VL patients. There is a paucity of information regarding the cytokine profile expressed by different target tissues in the same individual and the changes it undergoes throughout the course of infection. In this work we evaluated IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-10, and TGF-β mRNA expression using real-time RT-PCR in 5 target tissues at 6 months and 16 months post-infection (PI) in a canine experimental model which mimics many aspects of human VL. The spleen and liver of Leishmania infantum experimentally-infected dogs elicited a pro- and anti- inflammatory response and high parasite density at 6 and 16 months PI. The popliteal lymph node, however, showed an up-regulation of IFN-β cytokin at commencement of the study and was at the chronic phase when the IL-10 and TGF-β expression appeared. In spite of skin parasite invasion, local cytokine response was absent at 6 months PI. Parasite growth and onset of clinical disease both correlated with dermal up-regulation of all the studied cytokines. Our VL model suggests that central target organs, such as the spleen and liver, present a mixed cytokine immune response early on infection. In contrast, an antiinflammatory/regulatory immune response in peripheral tissues is activated in the later chronic-patent stages of the disease. ï¿½ 2016 Rodrï¿½guez-Cortï¿½s et al.

Classical RVF vaccines are based on formalin-inactivated virus or the live-attenuated Smithburn strain. The inactivated vaccine is highly safe but requires multiple administrations and yearly re-vaccinations. Although the Smithburn vaccine provides solid protection after a single vaccination, this vaccine is not safe for pregnant animals. An alternative live-attenuated vaccine, named Clone 13, carries a large natural deletion in the NSs gene which encodes the major virulence factor of the virus. The Clone 13 vaccine was previously shown to be safe for young lambs and calves. Moreover, a study in pregnant ewes suggested that the vaccine could also be applied safely during gestation. To anticipate on a possible future incursion of RVFV in Europe, we have evaluated the safety of Clone 13 for young lambs and pregnant ewes. In line with the guidelines from the World Organisation for Animal health (Office International des Epizooties, OIE) and regulations of the European Pharmacopeia (EP), these studies were performed with an overdose. Our studies with lambs showed that Clone 13 dissemination within vaccinated animals is very limited. Moreover, the Clone 13 vaccine virus was not shed nor spread to in-contact sentinels and did not revert to virulence upon animal-to-animal passage. Importantly, a large experiment with pregnant ewes demonstrated that the Clone 13 virus is able to spread to the fetus, resulting in malformations and stillbirths. Altogether, our results suggest that Clone 13 can be applied safely in lambs, but that caution should be taken when Clone 13 is used in pregnant animals, particularly during the first trimester of gestation. © 2016 Makoschey et al.",2016

Despite their importance in the ecology of the virus as it relates to human cases of encephalitis, the pathogenesis of JEV in pigs remains obscure. In the present study, the localization and kinetics of virus replication were investigated in various tissues after experimental intravenous infection of pigs. The data demonstrate a rapid and broad spreading of the virus to the central nervous system (CNS) and various other organs. A particular tropism of JEV in pigs not only to the CNS but also for secondary lymphoid tissue, in particular the tonsils with the overall highest viral loads, was observed. In this organ, even 11 days post infection, the latest time point of the experiment, no apparent decrease in viral RNA loads and live virus was found despite the presence of a neutralizing antibody response. This was also well beyond the clinical and viremic phase. These results are of significance for the pathogenesis of JEV, and call for further experimental studies focusing on the cellular source and duration of virus replication in pigs. © 2016 Ricklin et al.",2016

Pigs shed virus in oronasal secretions and are highly susceptible to oronasal infection. Clinical symptoms, virus tropism and central nervous system histological lesions are similar in pigs infected through needle, contact or oronasal inoculation. In all cases, a particularly important site of replication are the tonsils, in which JEV is found to persist for at least 25 days despite the presence of high levels of neutralizing antibodies.

A group of sheep was inoculated with both strains and all infected sheep manifested early-onset viremia accompanied by a transient increase in temperatures. The Kenya-128B-15 strain manifested higher virulence compared to SA01-1322 by inducing more severe liver damage, and longer and higher viremia. Genome sequence analysis revealed sequence variations between the two isolates, which potentially could account for the observed phenotypic differences. We conclude that Kenya-128B-15 sheep infection represents a good and virulent challenge model for RVF. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",2016

Materials and Methods: A total of 10 pigs were inoculated with ASF virus (ASFV) (genotype II) in the study of the red blood cells (RBCs), blood and urine biochemistry in the dynamics of disease. Results: The major hematological differences observed in ASFV infected pigs were that the mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, and hematocrits were significantly decreased compared to controls, and the levels of erythropoietin were significantly increased. Also were detected the trends of decrease in RBC count at terminal stages of ASF. Analysis of blood biochemistry revealed that during ASF development, besides bilirubinemia significantly elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, and aspartate aminotransferase were detected. Analysis of urine biochemistry revealed the presence of bilirubinuria, proteinuria during ASF development. Proteinuria, especially at late stages of the disease reflects a severe kidney damage possible glomerulonefritis. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate the characteristics of developing hemolytic anemia observed in acute ASF (genotype II). ï¿½ Karalyan, et al.",2016

Development of prophylactic strategies to lower the parasite burden in dogs would reduce sand fly transmission thus lowering the incidence of zoonotic VL. Here we demonstrate that vaccination of dogs with a recombinant 14 kDa polypeptide of L. infantum nuclear transport factor 2 (Li-ntf2) mixed with adjuvant BpMPLA-SE resulted in the production of specific anti-Li-ntf2 IgG antibodies as well as IFN-γ release by the animals' peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with the antigen. In addition, immunization with this single and small 14 kDa polypeptide resulted in protracted progression of the infection of the animals after challenging with a high dose of virulent L. infantum. Five months after challenge the parasite load was lower in the bone marrow of immunized dogs compared to non-immunized animals. The antibody response to K39, a marker of active VL, at ten months after challenge was strong and significantly higher in the control dogs than in vaccinated animals. At the study termination vaccinated animals showed significantly more liver granulomas and lymphoid hyperplasia than non-vaccinated animals, which are both histological markers of resistance to infection. Together, these results indicate that the 14 kDa polypeptide is an attractive protective molecule that can be easily incorporated in a leishmanial polyprotein vaccine candidate to augment/complement the overall protective efficacy of the final product. © 2015 The Authors.

A vaccine formulation based on naturally excreted secreted (ES) antigens was prepared from L. infantum promastigote culture supernatant. This vaccine achieved successful results in Phase III trials and was licensed and marketed as CaniLeish. We recently showed that newly identified ES promastigote surface antigen (PSA), from both viable promastigotes and axenically-grown amastigotes, represented the major constituent and the highly immunogenic antigen of L. infantum and L. amazonensis ES products. We report here that three immunizations with either the recombinant ES LaPSA-38S (rPSA) or its carboxy terminal part LaPSA-12S (Cter-rPSA), combined with QA-21 as adjuvant, confer high levels of protection in naive L. infantum-infected Beagle dogs, as checked by bone marrow parasite absence in respectively 78.8% and 80% of vaccinated dogs at 6 months post-challenge. The parasite burden in infected vaccinated dogs was significantly reduced compared to placebo group, as measured by q-PCR. Moreover, our results reveal humoral and cellular immune response clear-cut differences between vaccinated and control dogs. An early increase in specific IgG2 antibodies was observed in rPSA/QA-21- and Cter-rPSA/QA-21-immunized dogs only. They were found functionally active in vitro and were highly correlated with vaccine protection. In vaccinated protected dogs, IFN-γ and NO productions, as well as anti-leishmanial macrophage activity, were increased. These data strongly suggest that ES PSA or its carboxy-terminal part, in recombinant forms, induce protection in a canine model of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis by inducing a Th1-dominant immune response and an appropriate specific antibody response.

Mosquito-control measures currently include physical activities to reduce mosquito-breeding sites and the application of mosquito larvicides or aerosolized insecticides to kill adults (adulticides) when arboviral diseases such as WNV or Zika virus are detected in mosquito populations. Organochlorine, organophosphorus, carbamate, and pyrethroid insecticides are often used. Previous work suggests an effect of pyrethroids on the immune system in a variety of vertebrates. We examined the effects of exposure to aerosolized Permanone® 30:30 insecticide (permethrin and piperonyl butoxide in soy oil vehicle) at approximately 103 to 106 times potential environmental concentrations on the response of captive zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) to experimental challenge with WNV. Compared to vehicle control birds, WNV outcome was unchanged (65% of birds produced a viremia) in the “low” exposure (9.52 ± 3.13 mg/m3 standard deviation [SD] permethrin) group but reduced in the “high” exposure (mean 376.5 ± 27.9 mg/m3 SD permethrin) group (30% were viremic; p &lt; 0.05). After clearing WNV infection, birds treated with Permanone regained less body mass than vehicle-treated birds (p &lt; 0.001). The present study suggests that exposure to aerosolized Permanone insecticide at levels exceeding typical application rates has the potential to not change or to mildly enhance a bird's resistance to WNV.

Despite an almost silent circulation around their entry point in Hungary, an upsurge of pathogenicity occurred in 2010 as 262 people suffered from neuroinvasive disease in Greece. This increase in virulence was imputed to the emergence of a His249Pro mutation in the viral NS3 helicase, as previously evidenced in American crows experimentally infected with the prototype lineage 1 North-American WNV strain. However, since 2003, WNV strains bearing the NS3Pro genotype are regularly isolated in Western-Mediterranean countries without being correlated to any virulent outbreak in vertebrates. We thus sought to evaluate the weight of the NS3249Pro genotype as a virulence marker of WNV in an in vivo avian model of WNV infection. We therefore characterized three genetically-related Eastern-Europe lineage 2 WNV strains in day-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens: Hun2004 and Aus2008 which are both characterized by a NS3249His genotype, and Gr2011 which is characterized by a NS3249Pro genotype. Unlike Hun2004 and Aus2008, Gr2011 was weakly virulent in SPF chicks as Gr2011-induced viremia was lower and waned quicklier than in the Hun2004 and Aus2008 groups. Overall, this study showed that the presence of a proline residue at position 249 of the viral NS3 helicase is neither sufficient nor necessary to confer pathogenicity to any given lineage 2 WNV strain in birds. © 2015 Dridi et al.",2015

Viral RdRps are known to lack proofreading capabilities and as a result viruses such as WNV exist as a mixture of viral genotypes within an infection, enabling the virus to readily emerge and adapt to new host environments. To test the consequences of subtle structural alterations remote from the RdRp active-site, the following single point mutations were engineered in the WNV NS5 RdRp coding region: T363N, A365N, and T537I; these mutations were selected in an effort to stabilize the secondary structural elements near the rNTP binding pocket of the RdRp. Mutant viruses were tested in vitro on Vero, C6/36, Culex tarsalis and DF-1 cell types and in vivo in one day old chickens and Culex pipiens mosquitoes. Plaque morphology was affected by each mutation and growth and RNA replication kinetics were altered as well. Our results demonstrate that subtle alteration of the RdRp protein away from the active site can have a significant overall biological effect on WNV fitness, and that this effect can be host-dependent. © 2012 Elsevier Inc..",2012

Culex mosquitoes with a disseminated infection readily transmitted virus by bite, but even when inoculated with WNV, the two Mansonia failed to transmit virus, indicating a salivary gland barrier. These studies indicate that the three Culex species may play a role in the transmission of WNV in Kenya. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.",2011

Here, six RNA extraction methods coupled with optimised dsRNA denaturation and real-time RT-PCR were evaluated for the quantitation of BTV in blood samples from experimentally infected sheep and results were correlated to infectious virus titres. An exogenous dsRNA internal control (IC) from the closely related Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) was used to assess the efficiency of BTV genome extraction, dsRNA denaturation, RT, and PCR amplification. Recovery rates of IC and BTV dsRNA copies from extracted blood samples were highly correlated. Adjustment of BTV concentrations according to the IC recovery reduced variation in sample analyses among the different extraction methods and improved the accuracy of BTV quantitation. The EID50/ml titre, determined in blood samples from sheep infected experimentally with BTV-1 or BTV-9, correlated highly with the assessed concentration of BTV dsRNA copies. However, this correlation was consistent only during the first 28 days post-infection. The optimised extraction methods and quantitative RT-PCR could be useful for experimental studies of BTV transmission, pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy, or adapted further for the detection and quantitation of EHDV, African horse sickness virus and other dsRNA viruses. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",2010

Although resmethrin has been considered benign to birds, no studies have evaluated whether the environmentally employed form of resmethrin with PBO synergist (synergized resmethrin (SR)) can suppress avian immunity to WNV infection and enhance a bird's host competence. Recognizing that wild birds confront toxicological stressors in the context of various physiological states, we exposed four groups (n=9-11) of 9-week-old chickens (Gallus domesticus) to drinking water with either SR (three alternate days at 50μg/l resmethrin+150μg/l piperonyl butoxide), CORT (10 days at 20mg/l to induce subacute stress), the combination of SR and CORT, or 0.10% ethanol vehicle coincident with WNV infection. Compared to controls, SR treatment did not magnify but extended viremia by 1 day, and depressed IgG; CORT treatment elevated (mean, 4.26log10PFU/ml) and extended viremia by 2 days, enhanced IgM and IgG, and increased oral virus. The combination of SR and CORT increased the number of chickens that shed oral virus compared to those treated with CORT alone. None of the chickens developed a readily infectious viremia to mosquitoes (none ≥5log10PFU/ml), but viremia in a CORT-exposed chicken was up to 4.95log10PFU/ml. Given that SR is utilized during WNV outbreaks, continued work toward a complete risk assessment of the potential immunotoxic effects of SR is warranted. This would include parameterization of SR exposures with immunological consequences in wild birds using both replicating (in the laboratory) and non-replicating (in the field) antigens. As a start, this study indicates that SR can alter some immunological parameters, but with limited consequences to primary WNV infection outcome, and that elevated CORT mildly enhances SRs immunotoxicity in chickens. © 2010.",2010

Thirty post-hatch-year eared doves were subcutaneously inoculated with the genotype V SLEV 78V-6507 viral strain and subsequently bled. No deaths or clinical signs of illness were observed in the inoculated doves. The viremia titers ranged from 2 to 5.5 log10 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL during 1-7 days postinoculation (dpi), the highest being observed on the 4th dpi. Mosquitoes were collected using can traps baited with chicken and eared doves for comparison. A total of 2792 mosquitoes belonging to 5 species were collected. Ninety percent of the mosquitoes collected in eared dove-baited can traps were Culex quinquefasciatus.

Considering that eared doves were frequently found naturally infected by SLEV, that they developed viremia titers higher than the minimum infection threshold needed to infect Cx. quinquefasciatus, and that these mosquitoes also fed on eared doves, they could be considered competent hosts for SLEV. © 2008 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2008

Studies were performed to determine if viral infection differed in chickens infected with West Nile virus (WNV) by mosquito bite or needle inoculation. Mosquito-infected chickens exhibited levels of viremia and viral shedding that were up to 1,000 times higher at 6, 12, and 24 hours post-feeding (PF) compared with those inoculated with 103 PFU by needle. Follow-up studies were conducted to determine if enhanced early infection was due to a higher viral dose inoculated by mosquitoes. Needle inoculation with successively higher doses of WNV led to higher early viremia and viral shedding; a dose ≥ 104 PFU by needle was required to attain the high early viremia observed in mosquito-infected chickens. Mosquitoes inoculated WNV at this level as estimated by feeding on a hanging drop of blood (mean: 102.5, range: 100.7-104.6 PFU). These results indicate that enhanced early infection in mosquito-infected chickens may be explained by higher viral dose delivered by mosquitoes. On the other hand, chickens infected by multiple mosquitoes (N = 3-11) had viremic titers that were 25-50 times higher at 6 and 12 hours PF than in chickens infected by a single mosquito, suggesting that viral dose is not the only factor involved in enhanced early infection. The likelihood that enhanced early infection in mosquito-infected chickens is due to a higher viral dose inoculated by mosquitoes and/or other factors (saliva, inoculation location, or viral source) is discussed.

A single injection given either subcutaneously or intramuscularly resulted in 75% protection of the vaccinated groups, while two injections spaced two weeks apart resulted in 94% protection. Groups of geese, vaccinated at the farms and challenged under controlled conditions in the laboratory, showed levels of protection ranging from 39% to 72% for TME vaccine and 52% and 80% for WNV vaccine.

Zhang","Laboratory and field studies of an antigen capture ELISA for bluetongue virus","An improved bluetongue antigen capture ELISA (BTACE) technique was evaluated for its ability to detect the full range of 24 bluetongue (BLU) serotypes. The BTACE detected all 24 serotypes in cell culture fluids, including eight serotypes where the representative strains originated from both Australia and also from the South African reference collection. The amount of infectious virus required to obtain a positive BTACE result varied between 100-1000 TCID50. This was approximately 10-fold more sensitive than the antigen capture test described previously (Hosseini, M., Hawkes, R.A., Kirkland, P.D., Dixon, R., 1998. J. Virol. Methods 75, 39-46.). The BTACE method was compared with conventional passage in cell culture to detect the presence of virus in the tissues of embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) which had been inoculated intravenously with the blood of sheep and cattle infected experimentally with the eight Australian serotypes of BLU (1, 3, 9, 15, 16, 20, 21, and 23). The BTACE method was at least as sensitive as the conventional cell culture detecting virus in ECEs, obviating the need for prolonged cell culture passage to detect the virus. A comparison of the amount of antigen detected in different embryo tissues indicated that liver homogenates gave the highest positive to negative ratios in the BTACE and were selected as the specimen of choice. In studies of sheep infected with all 24 South African reference BLU serotypes this new BTACE was able to detect viraemia with all serotypes. Finally, the BTACE was validated in surveillance programs for BLU in both New South Wales, Australia and in Yunnan Province, People's Republic of China. Blood samples from sentinel cattle were inoculated into ECEs. Homogenised ECE livers were tested by BTACE and those positive were passaged subsequently in cell culture for virus isolation and identification. This protocol led to the efficient isolation of field isolates of many serotypes. The high sensitivity and broad reactivity of the method indicates that it should be valuable for BLU diagnosis and surveillance programs. Copyright (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.",2000

The duration of each animal's ensuing viremia was monitored, using a BTV serogroup-specific nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and an embryonating chicken egg (ECE) inoculation procedure. Mean duration of viremia was 100 and 38 days for the PCR and ECE methods, respectively. This difference was significant (P < 0.001) and documents a more prolonged viremia in virus-exposed sheep than has been reported. A dual internal oligonucleotide solution hybridization procedure was developed for the rapid (2 hours) colorimetric detection and identification of BTV-specific PCR products. This enzyme-linked oligonucleotide sorbent assay (ELOSA) relied on annealing of separate biotinylated and fluoresceinated probes to the amplified BTV nucleic acid; these complexes were captured on streptavidin-coated microtitration wells and were detected, using a horseradish peroxidase-labeled antifluorescein antibody conjugate. End-point dilution analyses of PCR products indicated that the ELOSA was more sensitive than gel electrophoretic or comparable colorimetric slot-blot hybridization techniques. The BTV PCR-ELOSA system represents a more sensitive and expeditious means of diagnosing BTV-induced viremia than does the ECE procedure currently used. The combination of ELOSA with PCR should facilitate practical application of nucleic acid technology to diagnostic veterinary medicine.",1993

Three ts mutants (158, 214, and 260) expressed stable ts phenotypes as determined both by six‐hour leak yield and efficiency of plaquing (EOP) analyses. Progeny of ts mutant 214 grown at the nonpermissive temperature lacked hemagglutinin activity. The sp mutant (148) was as highly virulent as the wild‐type virus (WTV) for newly hatched chickens (infected when 12 hours old), whereas the ts mutants were attenuated in their virulence for this host. Attentuation was correlated with lower viremia titers in 24‐hour postinfection blood samples. The WTV and those mutants able to infect 21‐day‐old chickens produced nonlethal infections but the growth of ts 158 was apparently restricted in this high‐temperature nonpermissive host. All ts mutants except ts 158 lost their ts phenotype after growth for 24 hours in newly hatched chickens and in duck embryonic cell culture (DECC) maintained at 42°C.

Frozen and thawed BTV-contaminated ejaculates collected during periods of viremia from 2 bulls experimentally infected with cell culture-adapted BTV serotype 17 were used in isolation, titration and fractionation studies. Blood collected from the 2 bulls concurrently with the semen was titrated in chicken embryos. Bull semen was toxic for both isolation systems. Toxicity was associated with both the spermatozoa and seminal plasma. Dilution of the semen at least 1:25, addition of peptone or tryptose broth to the diluent, limitation of adsorption time and postinoculation washing of cell culture monolayers all reduced the destructive effects of semen. Isolation of BTV was successful from 11 ejaculates and was titratable in 9 of these. Blind passage of surviving embryos or cell cultures at the endpoints of the titrations produced BTV isolations in 4 instances. The virus was never isolated from semen in the absence of concurrent viremia. Peak seminal BTV titers of 10(5.5) CEIVLD50/ml and 10(5.7) TCID50/ml were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1985

Objective: We investigated the sequential haematological and biochemical changes in peste des petits ruminants (PPR)-infected Black Bengal goats. Methods: Goats were either infected with PPR virus (PPRV; n = 8) or sham infected with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (n = 4) via the intranasal route. Blood and sera were collected from both groups at different days post-infection (dpi) and analysed. Goats were sacrificed at different dpi and the amount of PPRV RNA in different tissues was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Results: The PPRV-infected goats showed mild depression and scanty nasal secretions starting at 4 dpi which became severe with high fever (106°F), dyspnoea, stomatitis, profuse orinasal discharge and diarrhoea at 9–13 dpi. PPRV RNA was detected in different tissues of infected goats. Severe lymphocytic leukopenia (at 18 dpi) was observed in infected goats. Total protein and albumin decreased in infected goats starting at 10 dpi. An elevated level of enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, creatine kinase, aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase) and metabolites (blood urea nitrogen and urea B) were found in infected goats starting at 7–10 dpi, suggesting damages in the liver and kidneys. PPR-infected goats showed elevated sodium and chloride ions starting at 7 dpi. The majority of infected goats were seroconverted by 14 dpi. Conclusions: Anti-diarrheal agents, aqua solutions and other medicine to support liver and kidney functions could be considered as supportive therapy against PPRV infection. © 2020 The Authors Veterinary Medicine and Science Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",2020

However, the efficacy of these vaccines to protect the pig against field CSF strains needs to be considered, based on circulating strains of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Materials and Methods: Recombinant E2-CSFV protein produced by baculovirus/insect cell system was analyzed by western blots and immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. The effect of CSFV-E2 subunit vaccines was evaluated in experimental pigs with three genotypes of CSFV challenge. Anti-E2 specific and neutralizing antibodies in experimental pigs were analyzed by blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralization peroxidize-linked assay. Results: The data showed that CSFV VN91-E2 subunit vaccine provided clinical protection in pigs against three different genotypes of CSFV without noticeable clinical signs, symptoms, and mortality. In addition, no CSFV was isolated from the spleen of the vaccinated pigs. How-ever, the unvaccinated pigs exhibited high clinical scores and the successful virus isolation from spleen. These results showed that the E2-specific and neutralizing antibodies induced by VN91-E2 antigen appeared at day 24 after first boost and a significant increase was observed at day 28 (p<0.01). This response reached a peak at day 35 and continued until day 63 when compared to controls. Importantly, VN91-E2 induced E2-specific and neutralizing antibodies protected experimental pigs against high virulence of CSFVs circulating in Vietnam, including genotype 1.1, 2.1, and 2.2. Conclusion: These findings also suggested that CSFV VN91-E2 subunit vaccine could be a promising vaccine candidate for the control and prevention of CSFV in Vietnam. © Korean Vaccine Society.",2020

In many countries, the use of vaccines is restricted due to limitations of subunit vaccines with regard to efficacy and onset of protection as well as failure of live vaccines to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA principle). Chimeric pestiviruses based on CSF virus (CSFV) and the related bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) have been licensed as live marker vaccines in Europe and Asia, but cross-reactive antibodies can cause problems in DIVA application due to close antigenic relationship. To develop marker vaccine candidates with improved DIVA properties, three chimeric viruses were generated by replacing Erns of CSFV Alfort-Tübingen with homologue proteins of only distantly related pestiviruses. The chimeric viruses “Ra”, “Pro”, and “RaPro” contained Erns sequences of Norway rat and Pronghorn pestiviruses or a combination of both, respectively. In porcine cells, the “Pro” chimera replicated to high titers, while replication of the “Ra” chimera was limited. The “RaPro” chimera showed an intermediate phenotype. All vaccine candidates were attenuated in a vaccination/ challenge trial in pigs, but to different extents. Inoculation induced moderate to high levels of neutralizing antibodies that protected against infection with a genetically heterologous, highly virulent CSFV. Importantly, serum samples of vaccinated animals did not show any cross-reactivity in a CSFV Erns antibody ELISA. In conclusion, the Erns antigen from distantly related pestiviruses can provide a robust serological negative marker for a new generation of improved CSFV marker vaccines based on the chimeric pestivirus concept. © 2020 The Author(s).

Although vaccination with the C-strain against classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is widely carried out and severe outbreaks of CSF seldom occur in China, CSF is sporadic in many pig herds and novel sub-subgenotypes of CSFV endlessly emerge. Thus, new measures are needed to eradicate CSFV from Chinese farms. The emergence of a pseudorabies virus (PRV) variant also posed a new challenge for the control of swine pseudorabies. Here, the recombinant PRV strain JS-2012-ΔgE/gI-E2 expressing E2 protein of CSFV was developed by inserting the E2 expression cassette into the intergenic region between the gG and gD genes of the gE/gI-deletion PRV variant strain JS-2012-ΔgE/gI. The recombinant virus was stable when passaged in vitro. A single vaccination of JS-2012-ΔgE/gI-E2 via intramuscular injection fully protected against lethal challenges of PRV and CSFV. Vaccination of piglets with the recombinant JS-2012-ΔgE/gI-E2 in the presence of high levels of maternally derived antibodies (Abs) to PRV can provide partial protection against lethal challenge of CSFV. Vaccination of the recombinant PRV JS-2012-ΔgE/gI-E2 strain did not induce the production of Abs to the gE protein of PRV or to the CSFV proteins other than E2. Thus, JS-2012-ΔgE/gI-E2 appears to be a promising recombinant marker vaccine candidate against PRV and CSFV for the control and eradication of the PRV variant and CSFV. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2020

Goats are usually known to be more susceptible to the disease. Infection chronology, virus circulation, and the disease early detection need to be better understood. This study evaluates the tissue tropism and pathogenesis of PPR following experimental infection of goats using a lineage IV virus, the most dominant in the world originated from Asia. PPRV infection was experimentally induced in 4 six-month-old goats by intra-nasal and intravenous route of cell virus suspension and from infectious mashed tissue. The clinical signs were observed and goats were euthanized at predetermined clinical score level for post-mortem examinations and PPRV detection by RT-PCR. Clinical signs of infection were present, pyrexia, serous-mucopurulent nasal discharges, coughing, diarrhea and asthenia, for both cell virus suspension and infectious mashed tissue. PPRV genome was highly detected in swabs and tissues with clinical signs dominated by pulmonary attack and digestive symptoms secondary. Results: Results of this study indicates that PPRV is an invasive infection in animals that in a short period, less than 10 days, invade all vital organs. On live animals, early diagnostic may be easily done on lacrimal and rectal swabs.

However, the relationship between ER stress, autophagy, and viral replication during in vivo and in vitro infection of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) remains unclear. In this study, we established a pig model for CSFV infection and found that viral loads of CSFV differed in 10 kinds of infected organs, and that the degree of tissue lesions was to some extent positively correlated with CSFV replication in vivo. Next, we found that CSFV infection not only induced ER stress and subsequently activated three unfolded protein responses (UPR) pathways including protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and activating transcription factor-6 (ATF-6) pathways, but also triggered complete autophagy in main immune organs and partial nonimmune organs exhibiting severer pathological injuries and higher viral loads. However, only the IRE1 pathway and no autophagy were activated in some other nonimmune organs with slighter pathologies and lower viral loads. These results indicate a potential link between CSFV-induced ER stress and autophagy, both of which are associated with the CSFV replication in vivo. We further performed in vitro experiments and found that CSFV infection activates the PERK and IRE1 pathways and autophagy in cultured porcine kidney cell lines (PK-15) and macrophage cell lines (3D4/2), and pharmacological regulation of ER stress remarkably changed autophagic activities induced by CSFV, suggesting that CSFV-induced autophagy can be mediated by ER stress possibly via the PERK and IRE1 pathway. Furthermore, treatment with ER stress regulators significantly altered copy numbers of NS5B genes, expression of Npro proteins, and viral titers in CSFV-infected cells or in cells treated with autophagy regulators prior to CSFV infection, suggesting the requirement of ER stress-mediated autophagy for CSFV replication in vitro. Collectively, our data demonstrate that CSFV induces ER stress-mediated autophagy to sustain its replication in vivo and in vitro, which may be one of the potential strategies exploited by CSFV for immune evasion. This finding will provide new insights into mechanisms of replication and pathogenesis of CSFV, and development of new strategies for controlling CSF. © Copyright © 2019 Zhu, Chen, Qin, Ma, Fan, Wu, Li, Fan, Yi, Ding, Chen and Zhao.",2019

However, little is known about how vaccination impacts the selective pressures acting on the classical swine fever virus (CSFV). Here we use high-throughput sequencing of viral genomes to investigate evolutionary changes in virus populations following the challenge of naïve and vaccinated pigs with the highly virulent CSFV strain ""Koslov"". The challenge inoculum contained an ensemble of closely related viral sequences, with three major haplotypes being present, termed A, B, and C. After the challenge, the viral haplotype A was preferentially located within the tonsils of naïve animals but was highly prevalent in the sera of all vaccinated animals. We find that the viral population structure in naïve pigs after infection is very similar to that in the original inoculum. In contrast, the viral population in vaccinated pigs, which only underwent transient low-level viremia, displayed several distinct changes including the emergence of 16 unique non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were not detectable in the challenge inoculum. Further analysis showed a significant loss of heterogeneity and an increasing positive selection acting on the virus populations in the vaccinated pigs. We conclude that vaccination imposes a strong selective pressure on viruses that subsequently replicate within the vaccinated animal. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2019

This has led to speculation about the possible circulation of viral strains of low virulence. To investigate this possibility, five field isolates within the predominant genotype 2 (2.1b, 2.1c, 2.1 h and 2.2) were evaluated and compared by experimental infection of naturally farrowed but colostrum-deprived piglets. All infected piglets displayed clinical signs, including persistent high fever, depression, anorexia, dyspnea, conjunctivitis, constipation, and hesitant gait. Typical pathological lesions, including pulmonary edema, hemorrhagic or cellulosic exudation, and swelling and hemorrhage of lymph nodes, were observed. Viremia and E rns protein expression in the blood of all infected animals were detectable from 3 to 5 days post infection (DPI), their presence correlating with the onset of fever, clinical signs and leukopenia. E2 antibody did not develop in any of the field CSFV-infected piglets during the disease course, while E rns antibody was detectable in 4–56% of infected animals at various time points. Mortalities ranged from 20 to 80% within 21 DPI, progressing to 100% by 43 DPI. Based on clinical scores and fatalities within 21 DPI, 2 of the 5 field isolates were classified as of moderate virulence and 3 of high virulence; i.e., no field isolates of low virulence were identified.

A recent study has demonstrated that the E2 protein of C-strain plays a major role in its adaptation to rabbits. E2 protein in combination with either Erns or E1 confers rabbit adaptation for the C-strain, and the residues P108 and T109 in domain I of E2 are critical for rabbit adaptation. To further identify the contributions of the glycoproteins to rabbit adaptation, a series of C-strain-based chimeric viruses containing single or double glycoprotein substitutions of the Shimen strain were generated and inoculated into rabbits. Profiles of rectal temperature, viral RNA, E2 protein expression, and antibody responses were compared among the chimeric viruses. Replacement of Erns, E2, Erns–E2, or E1–E2 of the C-strain with the counterpart(s) of the Shimen strain led to decreased fever response, reduction of viral RNA and antibody responses in rabbits, as compared with their parental C-strain. The C-strain-based chimeric virus expressing the Shimen strain E1 exhibited typical fever response and viral RNA level similar to the C-strain. However, substitution of both Erns and E2 in the C-strain backbone abolished fever response, and the chimeric virus did not show adaptation in rabbits as demonstrated by lack of viral RNA and E2 protein expression in the spleen and weak antibody responses. These results indicate that Erns has partial contribution to adaptation of the C-strain in rabbits, and combination of E2 and Erns is essential for the C-strain to have adaptive replication in rabbits. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2019

Endemic in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, the disease is currently progressing with occurrences reported in North Africa, Turkey and in Georgia, and now threatens Europe. Much remains unknown about the infection dynamics, the virulence of the different strains and species/breed susceptibility. Robust experimental challenge models are needed to explore these fields and to confirm the efficacy of currently sold vaccines. We first assessed virulence of two PPR virus strains (CI89 and MA08) in Saanen goats. Whereas the MA08 strain led to classical severe clinical signs of PPR, the CI89 strain appeared to cause a mild disease in Saanen goats, highlighting the difference in virulence between strains in this animal model. We further demonstrated the importance of the inoculation route in the appearance of clinical signs and that ocular excretion is a better choice than blood for viral detection. After developing a robust challenge model, we assessed the efficacy of a vaccine (PPR-VAC®, BVI Botswana) against the MA08 strain and demonstrated that this vaccine blocked viral excretion and significantly reduced clinical signs.

After infection with a moderate virulence strain at 8 hours after birth, CSFV is able to induce viral persistence. These animals may appear clinically healthy or showed unspecific clinical signs despite the permanent viremia and high viral shedding, in absence of immune response to the virus. Given the role played by this infection in disease control, we aimed to evaluate the capacity of CSFV to induce postnatal persistent infection at 3 weeks after birth. Nine pigs were CSFV infected and sampled weekly during 6 weeks and viral, clinical, pathological and immunological tests were carried out. Also, the CD4/CD8 ratio was calculated with the purpose to relate this marker with the CSFV persistent infection. The IFN-α response was detected mainly 1 week after infection, being similar in all the infected animals. However, 44.4% of animals were CSFV persistently infected, 33.3% died and 22.2% developed specific antibody response. Interestingly, in persistently infected pigs, the T-CD8 population was increased, the T-CD4 subset was decreased and lower CD4/CD8 ratios were detected. This is the first report of CSFV capacity to confer postnatal persistent infection in pigs infected at 3 weeks after birth, an age in which the weaning could be carried out in some swine production systems. This type of infected animals shed high amounts of virus and are difficult to evaluate from the clinical and anatomopathological point of view. Therefore, the detection of this type of infection and its elimination in endemic areas will be relevant for global CSF eradication. Finally, the low CD4/CD8 ratios found in persistently infected animals may be implicated in maintaining high CSFV replication during persistence and further studies will be performed to decipher the role of these cells in CSFV immunopathogenesis. © 2018 The Authors.

Outbreaks of CSF in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America had significant adverse impacts on animal health, food security and the pig industry. The disease is generally contained by prevention of exposure through import restrictions (e.g. banning import of live pigs and pork products), localized vaccination programmes and culling of infected or at-risk animals, often at very high cost. Current CSFV-modified live virus vaccines are protective, but do not allow differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA), a critical aspect of disease surveillance programmes. Alternatively, first-generation subunit vaccines using the viral protein E2 allow for use of DIVA diagnostic tests, but are slow to induce a protective response, provide limited prevention of vertical transmission and may fail to block viral shedding. CSFV E2 subunit vaccines from a baculovirus/insect cell system have been developed for several vaccination campaigns in Europe and Asia. However, this expression system is considered expensive for a veterinary vaccine and is not ideal for wide-spread deployment. To address the issues of scalability, cost of production and immunogenicity, we have employed an Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression platform in Nicotiana benthamiana and formulated the purified antigen in novel oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants. We report the manufacturing of adjuvanted, plant-made CSFV E2 subunit vaccine. The vaccine provided complete protection in challenged pigs, even after single-dose vaccination, which was accompanied by strong virus neutralization antibody responses. © 2018 The Authors.

Although pigs inoculated orally or intramuscularly with JPN/1/2018 developed hyperthermia and had decreased leucocyte numbers, they survived for the whole experimental period and showed less severe clinical signs than those infected with the ALD strain. We confirmed the presence of characteristic multifocal infarction of the margin of the spleen that arises following infection with JPN/1/2018, albeit that this finding was not observed in all infected pigs. Both viruses efficiently spread to contact pigs in a similar manner, suggesting in transmissibility between the two strains. Viral RNAs were detected in all clinical samples, especially whole blood samples, before the pigs developed hyperthermia until at least approximately 2 weeks after inoculation.

Despite efforts by many government authorities to stamp out the disease from national pig populations, the disease remains widespread. Here, antiviral small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) were selected and then inserted at the porcine Rosa26 (pRosa26) locus via a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in strategy. Finally, anti-CSFV transgenic (TG) pigs were produced by somatic nuclear transfer (SCNT). Notably, in vitro and in vivo viral challenge assays further demonstrated that these TG pigs could effectively limit the replication of CSFV and reduce CSFV-associated clinical signs and mortality, and disease resistance could be stably transmitted to the F1-generation. Altogether, our work demonstrated that RNA interference (RNAi) technology combining CRISPR/Cas9 technology offered the possibility to produce TG animal with improved resistance to viral infection. The use of these TG pigs can reduce CSF-related economic losses and this antiviral strategy may be useful for future antiviral research. © 2018 Xie et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",2018

Pulmonary oedema and haemorrhages in lung parenchyma are common lesions in the acute forms of CSF that may compromise pig survival and whose pathogenetic mechanisms remain unclear. The appearance of pulmonary lesions in pigs infected with Alfort/187 strain of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) euthanized between 2 and 17 days postinfection (dpi) and the role played by cytokines secreted by different pulmonary macrophage populations in the evolution of lesions was evaluated in this study. Microscopic changes of alveolar septal thickening along with oedema and haemorrhages became more severe at middle-late stages of the experiment. A significant increase in the number of pulmonary macrophages, mainly pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIMs), was observed coinciding with the onset of alveolar septal thickening from Day 4 pi. PIMs were the main target of CSFV from initial stages of infection while the presence of infected pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) was scarce and late. Initial infection of PIMs induced phagocytic and biosynthetic activation with subsequent release of chemotactic cytokines. TNFα and, to a lesser extent, IL-1α secreted by PIMs were the major cytokines involved, while IL-6 played only a minor role. On the contrary, results suggested only a secondary role of PAMs as source of cytokines. The presence of vascular changes from Day 9 pi coincided with the highest levels of infected PIMs and the highest number of pro-inflammatory cytokines secreting PIMs. Activation and phagocytosis of platelets were observed in the lungs of infected pigs from early stages, also coinciding with the expression of cytokines with a proven procoagulant activity. The existence of intravascular coagulation phenomena in lung was ruled out. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2018

To compare host immune responses to differentially virulent CSFV strains in pigs, fifteen 8-week-old specific-pathogen-free pigs were randomly divided into four groups and inoculated with the CSFV Shimen strain (a highly virulent strain), the HLJZZ2014 strain (a moderately virulent strains), C-strain (an avirulent strain), and DMEM (mock control), respectively. Infection with the Shimen or HLJZZ2014 strain resulted in fever, clinical signs and histopathological lesions, which were not observed in the C-strain-inoculated pigs, though low viral genome copies were detected in the peripheral blood and tissue samples. The data showed that the virulence of the strains affected the outcome of duration and intensity of the disease rather than the tissue tropism of the virus. Furthermore, leukopenia, lymphocytopenia, differentiation of T-cells, and the secretion of cytokines associated with inflammation or apoptosis such as interferon alpha (IFN-α), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 were induced by the virulent CSFV infection, the differences reflected in onset and extent of the regulation. Taken together, our results revealed that the major differences among the three strains resided in the kinetics of host response to the infection: severe and immediate with the highly virulent strain, while progressive and delayed with the moderately virulent one.

However, the current vaccination strategy, which uses two single live attenuated vaccines, can result in interference for each other. In addition, the universally used CSFV vaccine C-strain does not allow for differentiation of infected and vaccinated animals. In this study, rPRRSV-E2, PRRS virus (PRRSV) expressing CSF virus (CSFV) E2, was constructed by reverse genetics. The E2 gene of CSFV was inserted between ORF1b and ORF2 in the genome of the PRRS vaccine virus, HuN4-F112. A copy of transcriptional regulatory sequence 6 was inserted at the 3′ terminal of the exogenous gene to produce CSFV E2 as a unique subgenomic mRNA transcript. The rPRRSV-E2 was stable for at least 25 serial cell passages. Single-shot intramuscular immunization of rPRRSV-E2 into pigs induced PRRSV-specific and CSFV-specific antibodies and fully protected pigs from lethal challenge with highly-pathogenic PRRSV and CSFV. These results demonstrate that a novel strategy for recombinant PRRSV production is effective, and suggest that rPRRSV-E2 is a promising live, virus-vectored vaccine against PRRS and a marker vaccine against CSF. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018

Recombinant vaccines that can protect from both infections have been reported as a promising solution for the future. SGP was used as a vector to express two structural proteins hemagglutinin or the fusion protein of PPRV. We compared immunity conferred by recombinant capripoxvirus vaccines expressing H or F or both HF. Safety and efficacy were evaluated in goats and sheep. Two vaccine doses were tested in sheep, 104.5TCDI50 in 1 ml dose was retained for the further experiment. Results showed that the recombinant HF confers an earlier and stronger immunity against both SGP and PPR. This recombinant vaccine protect also against the disease in exposed and unexposed sheep. The potential Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals of recombinant vaccines is of great advantage in any eradication program. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",2018

The morbidity and mortality rates post exposure (PE) were 96% and 60% respectively. Laboratory analyses revealed significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) in mean values of the haematological and serum biochemical indices between the PE and control groups. The PE group experienced a significant (P &lt; 0.05) increase in white blood cell (WBC), lymphocyte and monocytes after 10 days PE; the drop in glucose and high levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) indicated liver damage, while increased serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid arose from kidney impairment. The electrolyte imbalance (potassium, sodium and chloride ions) resulting from the symptomatic diarrhea affected the functionality of the Na+–K+ pump mechanisms, hence pathologic damage to the liver, kidneys, skin, gastrointestinal, respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The competitive enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay (c-ELISA) detected varying antibody levels in the PPR infected WAD goats; the percent inhibition was highest (P &lt; 0.001) in survivors (70.00 ± 1.73), then in contact group (60.00 ± 2.00), and least in infected (23.33 ± 1.53), which were sero-negative.

In China, CSF has been under control owing to extensive vaccination with the lapinized attenuated vaccine (C-strain) since 1950s, despite sporadic or endemic in many regions. However, recently, CSF outbreaks occurred in a large number of swine herds in China. Here, we isolated 15 CSFV strains from diverse C-strain-vaccinated pig farms in China and characterized the genetic variations and antigenicity of the new isolates. The new strains showed unique variations in the E2 protein and were clustered to the subgenotype 2.1d of CSFV recently emerging in China in the phylogenetic tree. Cross-neutralization test showed that the neutralizing titres of porcine anti-C-strain sera against the new isolates were substantially lower than those against both the highly virulent Shimen strain and the subgenotype 2.1b strains that were isolated in China in 2006 and 2009, respectively. In addition, experimental animal infection showed that the HLJZZ2014 strain-infected pigs displayed lower mortality and less severe clinical signs and pathological changes compared with the Shimen strain-infected pigs. The HLJZZ2014 strain was defined to be moderately virulent based on a previously established assessment system for CSFV virulence evaluation, and the virus shedding and the viral load in various tissues of the CSFV HLJZZ2014 strain-infected pigs were significantly lower than those of the Shimen strain-infected pigs. Taken together, the subgenotype 2.1d isolate of CSFV is a moderately virulent strain with molecular variations and antigenic alterations. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2017

Protection against sheep pox is mainly based on medical prophylaxis, vaccination being the only way. In Morocco, and up to now, there is no available information about local challenge strain to use for controlling the efficiency of vaccines produced against sheep pox. Hence, the objective of the present study was to evaluate and compare the pathogenicity of seven Sheeppox virus (SPVs) isolates from 1993-1995 in Morocco. Materials and Methods: These seven SPV isolates have undergone various tests to evaluate their pathogenicity: Passages and titration on cell culture, Experimental inoculation on sheep, Virus-neutralization, In vivo titration and viral re-isolation by real-time PCR assay. Results: All infected lambs showed severe clinical signs, while most of them have been reproduced on 5 dpi and persisted until 21 dpi. The lambs infected by Oj1P4, Oj2P4 and BerP5 appeared lethargic, reluctant to move compared to those infected by other isolates. The results also revealed that all isolates were able to induce serological response. Virus isolation from infected organs and blood and amplification of the viral DNA by real-time PCR proved the presence of the virus in tissues and blood of infected lambs. These Moroccan SPVs demonstrated that the three isolates Oj1P4, Oj2P4 and BerP5 have a high pathogenicity; especially the BerP5 isolate which has an important infectious titer. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that the Berkane isolate is the most pathogenic of the tested isolates and it can be an excellent challenge strain for the control of the efficiency of vaccines against sheep pox produced in Morocco. © 2018, Tehran University of Medical Science.

Subunit vaccines are a suitable alternative for the control of classical swine fever. However, such vaccines have as the main drawback the relatively long period of time required to induce a protective response, which hampers their use under outbreak conditions. In this work, a lentivirus-based gene delivery system is used to obtain a stable recombinant HEK 293 cell line for the expression of E2-CSFV antigen fused to porcine CD154 as immunostimulant molecule. The E2-CD154 chimeric protein was secreted into the medium by HEK293 cells in a concentration around 50 mg/L in suspension culture conditions using spinner bottles. The E2-CD154 immunized animals were able to overcome the challenge with a high virulent CSF virus strain performed 7 days after a unique dose of the vaccine without clinical manifestations of the disease. Specific anti-CSFV neutralizing antibodies and IFN-γ were induced 8 days after challenge equivalent to 14 days post-vaccination. The present work constitutes the first report of a subunit vaccine able to confer complete protection by the end of the first week after a single vaccination. These results suggest that the E2-CD154 antigen could be potentially used under outbreak conditions to stop CSFV spread and for eradication programs in CSF enzootic areas. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017

These animals also showed a type I interferon blockade in the absence of clinical signs. In this study, we assessed the infection generated in 7-week-old CSFV PI wild boars after infection with the African swine fever virus (ASFV). The wild boars were divided in two groups and were infected with ASFV. Group A comprised boars who were CSFV PI in a subclinical form and Group B comprised pestivirus-free wild boars. Some relevant parameters related to CSFV replication and the immune response of CSFV PI animals were studied. Additionally, serum soluble factors such as IFN-α, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ and sCD163 were analysed before and after ASFV infection to assess their role in disease progression. Results: After ASFV infection, only the CSFV PI wild boars showed progressive acute haemorrhagic disease; however, the survival rates following ASFV infection was similar in both experimental groups. Notwithstanding, the CSFV RNA load of CSFV PI animals remained unaltered over the study; likewise, the ASFV DNA load detected after infection was similar between groups. Interestingly, systemic type I FN-α and IL-10 levels in sera were almost undetectable in CSFV PI animals, yet detectable in Group B, while detectable levels of IFN-γ were found in both groups. Finally, the flow cytometry analysis showed an increase in myelomonocytic cells (CD172a+) and a decrease in CD4+ T cells in the PBMCs from CSFV PI animals after ASFV infection. Conclusions: Our results showed that the immune response plays a role in the progression of disease in CSFV subclinically infected wild boars after ASFV infection, and the immune response comprised the systemic type I interferon blockade. ASFV does not produce any interference with CSFV replication, or vice versa. ASFV infection could be a trigger factor for the disease progression in CSFV PI animals, as their survival after ASFV was similar to that of the pestivirus-free ASFV-infected group. This fact suggests a high resistance in CSFV PI animals even against a virus like ASFV; this may mean that there are relevant implications for CSF control in endemic countries. The diagnosis of ASFV and CSFV co-infection in endemic countries cannot be ruled out and need to be studied in greater depth. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017

We analysed the complete nucleotide sequence of the Pinar del Rio virus isolated after persistence in newborn piglets, as well as the genome sequence of the inoculum. The consensus genome sequence of the Pinar del Rio virus remained completely unchanged after 28 days of persistent infection in swine. More importantly, a unique poly-uridine tract was discovered in the 3′UTR of the Pinar del Rio virus, which was not found in the Margarita virus or any other known CSFV sequences.

The possible implications of this novel insertion on persistence and attenuation remain to be investigated. In addition, comparison of the amino acid sequence of the viral proteins Erns, E1, E2 and p7 of the Margarita and Pinar del Rio viruses showed that all non-conservative amino acid substitutions acquired by the Pinar del Rio isolate clustered in E2, with two of them being located within the B/C domain. Immunisation and cross-neutralisation experiments in pigs and rabbits suggest differences between these two viruses, which may be attributable to the amino acid differences observed in E2. Altogether, these data provide fresh insights into viral molecular features which might be associated with the attenuation and adaptation of CSFV for persistence in the field. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2017

In Taiwan, CSFVs from field outbreaks belong to two distinct genotypes. The historical genotype 3.4 dominated from the 1920s to 1996, and since 1996, the newly invading genotype 2.1 has dominated. To explain the phenomenon of this virus shift in the field, representative viruses belonging to genotypes 2.1 and 3.4 were either inoculated alone (single infection) or co-inoculated (co-infection), both in vivo and in vitro, to compare the virus replication and pathogenesis. In pigs co-infected with the genotype 2.1 TD/96/TWN strain and the genotype 3.4 94.4/IL/94/TWN strain, the newly invading genotype 2.1 was detected earlier in the blood, oral fluid, and feces, and the viral loads were consistently and significantly higher than that of the historical genotype 3.4. In cell cultures, the ratio of secreted virus to cell-associated virus of the genotype 2.1 strain was higher than that of the genotype 3.4 strain. This study is the first to demonstrate a possible explanation of virus shift in the field, wherein the newly invading genotype 2.1 replicates more efficiently than did genotype 3.4 and outcompetes the replication and pathogenicity of genotype 3.4 in pigs in the field. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2017

Methodological advances have a focus on endemic viral diseases in commercial pig production. More recently, these approaches have been adapted to non-invasive sampling of wild boar for transboundary animal disease detection for which these effective population level sampling methods have not been available. In this study, a rope-in-a-bait based oral fluid sampling technique was tested to detect classical swine fever virus nucleic acid shedding from experimentally infected domestic pigs. Results: Separated in two groups treated identically, the course of the infection was slightly differing in terms of onset of the clinical signs and levels of viral ribonucleic acid detection in the blood and oral fluid. The technique was capable of detecting classical swine fever virus nucleic acid as of day 7 post infection coinciding with the first detection in conventional oropharyngeal swab samples from some individual animals. Except for day 7 post infection in the ""slower onset group"", the chances of classical swine fever virus nucleic acid detection in ropes were identical or higher as compared to the individual sampling. Conclusions: With the provided evidence, non-invasive oral fluid sampling at group level can be considered as additional cost-effective detection tool in classical swine fever prevention and control strategies. The proposed methodology is of particular use in production systems with reduced access to veterinary services such as backyard or scavenging pig production where it can be integrated in feeding or baiting practices. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017

In Morocco, the first PPR outbreak was notified in 2008. Since then no cases were reported for seven years, probably due to three successive vaccination campaigns during 2008–2011 and close surveillance at the border areas. In June 2015, the disease re-emerged in Morocco, raising questions about the origin of the virus. The PPR virus was confirmed by qRT-PCR and virus was isolated from clinical samples on VeroNectin-4 cells. The disease was experimentally reproduced in Alpine goats using both sheep and goat derived outbreak isolates. Molecular characterization of the 2015 Moroccan PPR isolate confirmed the identity of the virus as lineage IV, closely related to the 2012 Algerian (KP793696) and 2012 Tunisian (KM068121) isolates and significantly distinct from the previous PPRV Morocco 2008 strain (HQ131927).

CSF endemic countries have to use routine vaccination with modified live virus (MLV) vaccines to prevent and control CSF. However, it is impossible to serologically differentiate MLV vaccinated pigs from those infected with CSF virus (CSFV). The aim of this study is to develop a one-dose E2-subunit vaccine that can provide protection against CSFV challenge. We hypothesize that a vaccine consisting of a suitable adjuvant and recombinant E2 with natural conformation may induce a similar level of protection as the MLV vaccine. Results: Our experimental vaccine KNB-E2 was formulated with the recombinant E2 protein (Genotype 1.1) expressed by insect cells and an oil-in-water emulsion based adjuvant. 10 pigs (3 weeks old, 5 pigs/group) were immunized intramuscularly with one dose or two doses (3 weeks apart) KNB-E2, and 10 more control pigs were administered normal saline solution only. Two weeks after the second vaccination, all KNB-E2 vaccinated pigs and 5 control pigs were challenged with 5×105 TCID50 CSFV Honduras/1997 (Genotype 1.3, 1 ml intramuscular, 1 ml intranasal). It was found that while control pigs infected with CSFV stopped growing and developed high fever (&gt;40 °C), high level CSFV load in blood and nasal fluid, and severe leukopenia 3-14 days post challenge, all KNB-E2 vaccinated pigs continued to grow as control pigs without CSFV exposure, did not show any fever, had low or undetectable level of CSFV in blood and nasal fluid. At the time of CSFV challenge, only pigs immunized with KNB-E2 developed high levels of E2-specific antibodies and anti-CSFV neutralizing antibodies. Conclusions: Our studies provide direct evidence that pigs immunized with one dose KNB-E2 can be protected clinically from CSFV challenge. This protection is likely mediated by high levels of E2-specific and anti-CSFV neutralizing antibodies. © 2016 The Author(s).",2016

Recently, the chimeric pestivirus “CP7_E2alf” (Suvaxyn® CSF Marker, Zoetis) was licensed as live attenuated marker vaccine by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In the context of risk assessments for an emergency vaccination scenario, the question has been raised whether pre-existing anti-pestivirus antibodies, especially against the vaccine backbone Bovine viral diarrhea virus type 1 (BVDV-1), would interfere with “CP7_E2alf” vaccination and the accompanying DIVA diagnostics. To answer this question, a vaccination-challenge-trial was conducted with Suvaxyn® CSF Marker and the “gold-standard” of live-modified CSF vaccines C-strain (RIEMSER® Schweinepestvakzine) as comparator. Pre-existing antibodies against BVDV-1 were provoked in a subset of animals through intramuscular inoculation of a recent field isolate from Germany (two injections with an interval of 2 weeks). Twenty-seven days after the first injection, intramuscular vaccination of pre-exposed and naïve animals with either “CP7_E2alf” or C-strain “Riems” was performed. Seven days later, all vaccinated animals and two additional controls were oro-nasally challenged with highly virulent CSF virus (CSFV) strain Koslov. It was demonstrated that pre-existing BVDV-1 antibodies do not impact on the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines against CSF. Both C-strain “Riems” and marker vaccine “CP7_E2alf” were able to confer full protection against highly virulent challenge seven days after vaccination. However, slight interference was seen with serological DIVA diagnostics accompanying the vaccination with CP7_E2alf. Amended sample preparation and combination of test systems was able to resolve most cases of false positive reactions. However, in such a co-infection scenario, optimization and embedding in a well-defined surveillance strategy is clearly needed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2016

A marker vaccine that enables differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) is highly desirable for control and eradication of these two diseases in endemic areas. Since late 2011, PR outbreaks have been frequently reported in many Bartha-K61-vaccinated pig farms in China. It has been demonstrated that a pseudorabies virus (PRV) variant with altered antigenicity and increased pathogenicity was responsible for the outbreaks. Previously, we showed that rPRVTJ-delgE/gI/TK, a gE/gI/TK-deleted PRV variant, was safe for susceptible animals and provided a complete protection against lethal PRV variant challenge, indicating that rPRVTJ-delgE/gI/TK can be used as an attractive vaccine vector.

Furthermore, the marker chimera was avirulent and displayed no viremia in inoculated pigs, which were completely protected from lethal CSFV challenge as early as 15 days post-inoculation.

Additionally, in PBMCs, a well-known target for CSFV viral replication, only the primary infecting virus RNA (Cat01 strain) could be detected, even after the isolation in ST cells, demonstrating SIE at the tissue level in vivo. Furthermore, the data analysis of the Margarita qRT-PCR, by means of calculated ΔCt values, supported that PBMCs from persistently infected animals were substantially protected from superinfection after in vitro inoculation with the Margarita virus strain, while this virus was able to infect naive PBMCs efficiently. In parallel, IFN-α values were undetectable in the sera from animals in Group B after inoculation with the CSFV Margarita strain. Furthermore, these animals were unable to elicit adaptive humoral (no E2-specific or neutralising antibodies) or cellular immune responses (in terms of IFN-γ-producing cells) after inoculation with the second virus. Finally, a sequence analysis could not detect CSFV Margarita RNA in the samples tested from Group B. Our results suggested that the SIE phenomenon might be involved in the evolution and phylogeny of the virus, as well as in CSFV control by vaccination. To the best of our knowledge, this study was one of the first showing efficient suppression of superinfection in animals, especially in the absence of IFN-α, which might be associated with the lack of innate immune mechanisms. © 2016 Muñoz-González et al.

Pseudorabies (PR), which is caused by pseudorabies virus (PRV), is another important infectious disease of pigs and other animals. Coinfections of pigs with PRV and CSFV occur occasionally in the field. The modified live vaccine Bartha- K61 strain has played an important role in the control of PR in many countries, including China. Since late 2011, however, increasing PR outbreaks caused by an emerging PRV variant have been reported in Bartha-K61-vaccinated swine populations on many farms in China. Previously, we generated a gE/gI-deleted PRV (rPRVTJ-delgE) based on this PRV variant, which was shown to be safe and can provide rapid and complete protection against lethal challenge with the PRV variant in pigs. Here, we generated a new recombinant PRV variant expressing the E2 gene of CSFV (rPRVTJ-delgE/gI-E2) and evaluated its immunogenicity and efficacy in pigs. The results showed that rPRVTJ-delgE/gI-E2 was safe for pigs, induced detectable anti-PRV and anti-CSFV neutralizing antibodies, and provided complete protection against the lethal challenge with either the PRV TJ strain or the CSFV Shimen strain. The data indicate that rPRVTJ-delgE/gI-E2 is a promising candidate bivalent vaccine against PRV and CSFV coinfections. Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.",2015

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the ability of CSFV to induce viral persistence upon early postnatal infection. Two litters of 10 piglets each were infected intranasally on the day of birth with low and moderate virulence CSFV isolates, respectively. During six weeks after postnatal infection, most of the piglets remained clinically healthy, despite persistent high virus titres in the serum. Importantly, these animals were unable to mount any detectable humoral and cellular immune response. At necropsy, the most prominent gross pathological lesion was a severe thymus atrophy. Four weeks after infection, PBMCs from the persistently infected seronegative piglets were unresponsive to both, specific CSFV and non-specific PHA stimulation in terms of IFN-γ-producing cells. These results suggested the development of a state of immunosuppression in these postnatally persistently infected pigs. However, IL-10 was undetectable in the sera of the persistently infected animals. Interestingly, CSFV-stimulated PBMCs from the persistently infected piglets produced IL-10. Nevertheless, despite the addition of the anti-IL-10 antibody in the PBMC culture from persistently infected piglets, the response of the IFN-γ producing cells was not restored. Therefore, other factors than IL-10 may be involved in the general suppression of the T-cell responses upon CSFV and mitogen activation. Interestingly, bone marrow immature granulocytes were increased and targeted by the virus in persistently infected piglets. Taken together, we provided the first data demonstrating the feasibility of CSFV in generating a postnatal persistent disease, which has not been shown for other members of the Pestivirus genus yet. Since serological methods are routinely used in CSFV surveillance, persistently infected pigs might go unnoticed. In addition to the epidemiological and economic significance of persistent CSFV infection, this model could be useful for understanding the mechanisms of viral persistence. © 2015 Muñoz-González et al.",2015

Assessment of the disease risks associated with material of porcine origin requires knowledge on the likely amount of virus in the original material, how long the virus may remain viable within the resulting product and how much of that product would need to be ingested to result in infection. Using material from pigs infected with CSFV, we determined the viable virus concentrations in tissues that comprise the majority of pork products. Decimal reduction values (D values), the time required to reduce the viable virus load by 90% (or 1log10), were determined at temperatures of relevance for chilling, cooking, composting and ambient storage. The rate of CSFV inactivation varied in different tissues. At lower temperatures, virus remained viable for substantially longer in muscle and serum compared to lymphoid and fat tissues. To enable estimation of the temperature dependence of inactivation, the temperature change required to change the D values by 90% (Z values) were determined as 13°C, 14°C, 12°C and 10°C for lymph node, fat, muscle and serum, respectively. The amount of virus required to infect 50% of pigs by ingestion was determined by feeding groups of animals with moderately and highly virulent CSFV. Interestingly, the virulent virus did not initiate infection at a lower dose than the moderately virulent strain. Although higher than for intranasal inoculation, the amount of virus required for infection via ingestion is present in only a few grams of tissue from infected animals. © 2015 .",2015

The CSFV E2-specific antibody titer was significantly higher in the rAd-E2-InvC group than that in the rAdV-E2 group as measured by NPLA and blocking ELISA. Pigs immunized with rAd-E2-InvC were completely protected against lethal challenge. Neither CSFV RNA nor pathological changes were detected in the tissues after CSFV challenge. These results demonstrate that rAd-E2-InvC could be an alternative to the existing CSF vaccine.

All three rescued viruses showed similar growth characteristics in vitro in comparison to parent vaccine strain and, following in vivo assessment the H mutant provided full protection in goats.

Tissue tropism of PPRV was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Lymph nodes, lymphoid tissue and digestive tract organs were the predominant sites of virus replication. The results presented in this study provide models for the comparative evaluation of PPRV pathogenesis and tissue tropism in both sheep and goats.

One of the strategies in evaluation under field conditions is the use of a new marker E2-based vaccine produced in the milk of adenovirally transduced goats. Previously we had demonstrated the efficacy of this antigen, which conferred early protection and long-lasting immunity in swine against CSFV infection. Here, we have used a simpler downstream process to obtain and formulate the recombinant E2 glycoprotein expressed in the mammary gland. The expression levels reached approximately 1.7 mg/ml, and instead of chromatographic separation of the antigen, we utilized a clarification process that eliminates the fat content, retains a minor amount of caseins, and includes an adenoviral inactivation step that improves the biosafety of the final formulation. In a vaccination and challenge experiment in swine, different doses of the E2 antigen contained within the clarified whey generated an effective immune response of neutralizing antibodies that protected all of the animals against a lethal challenge with CSFV. During the immunization and after challenge, the swine were monitored for adverse reactions related to the vaccine or symptoms of CSF, respectively. No adverse reactions or clinical signs of disease were observed in vaccinated animals, in which no replication of CSFV could be detected after challenge. Overall, we consider that the simplicity of the procedures proposed here is a further step toward the introduction and implementation of a commercial subunit vaccine against CSF.

However, it is unknown whether the nuclear localization of Npro correlates with the virulence of CSFV in the host. Previously, we showed that the Npro protein fused with interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was present only in the cytoplasm. Here, we generated and evaluated a recombinant CSFV vSM-IRF3 harboring the IRF3 gene inserted into the Npro gene of the highly virulent CSFV Shimen strain. Compared to the even nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-Npro fusion expressed by the recombinant CSFV EGFP-CSFV, vSM-IRF3 expressed an IRF3-Npro fusion protein that only was localized in the cytoplasm. vSM-IRF3 was markedly attenuated in vitro and in vivo, and the inoculated pigs were completely protected from lethal CSFV challenge, whereas the parental virus as well as EGFP-CSFV exhibited a typical virulent phenotype. Taken together, the nuclear localization of Npro plays a significant role in the CSFV replication and virulence. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014

Understanding these transmission routes is crucial in preventing the unlimited spread of the virus in a naïve population, and the subsequent eradication of the virus from that population. The objectives of the present study were to quantify virus transmission within a compartment, differentiating between transmission within a pen, transmission between pens via contact through (open) pen partitions, and transmission via the air. Furthermore, the possible contribution of each of these routes to infection of individual pigs was quantified. A CSFV outbreak was mimicked in a compartment housing 24 pigs in six different pens. Two pigs in one pen were inoculated with the moderately virulent Paderborn strain, and virus transmission to other pigs was followed in time. Virus transmission rates for transmission via the air (β of 0.33 (0.14-0.64) per day) and transmission between adjacent pens (β of 0.30 (0-0.88) per day) were comparable, but significantly lower than for virus transmission within a pen (β of 6.1 (0.86-18) per day). The route via the air created new focal points of infection, from which virus transmission continued through other routes. This shows that, at least within a compartment, transmission via the air is expected to play a relevant role in the fast spread of the virus after an initial slow start. This will have consequences for efficacy of intervention measures, including vaccination during an outbreak. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014

This genotype is known to be virulent leading to high morbidity and mortality. We experimentally infected two eight months old wild boar with 105,5 TCID50 of CSFV genotype 2.3 and kept the animals together with five noninoculated wild boar of the same age. Our original purpose was to evaluate a non-invasive sampling method based on saliva collection using ""rope-in-a-bait"" sampling baits. While expecting high morbidity, high level of virus shedding and some mortality, we actually observed a subclinical course of infection with an unexpected low contagiosity. The two inoculated animals infected only three contact animals while two contact animals remained uninfected. These findings substantially add to our epidemiological understanding of CSFV circulation in wild boar populations. CSFV infected animals older than six months and in good condition may not shed sufficient virus to transmit infection to all seronegative in-contact animals. The contagiosity in relation to the animal's age is discussed. This supports the hypothesis of silent perpetuation of CSFV in wild boar populations for several months if the wild boar density is sufficiently high. The feasibility of the ""rope-in-a-bait"" sampling method could be proven during the short viraemic phase of infected animals during the second week of infection. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014

With an aim of providing information on the cellular mechanisms that may mediate this protection, we explored the interaction of porcine natural killer (NK) cells and γδ T cells with CSFV. Both NK and γδ T cells were refractory to infection with attenuated or virulent CSFV, and no stimulatory effects, as assessed by the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II (MHC-II), perforin, and gamma interferon (IFN-γ), were observed when the cells were cultured in the presence of CSFV. Coculture with CSFV and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) or plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) showed that pDCs led to a partial activation of both NK and T cells, with upregulation of MHC-II being observed. An analysis of cytokine expression by infected DC subsets suggested that this effect was due to IFN-γ secreted by infected pDCs. These results were supported by ex vivo analyses of NK and γδ T cells in the tonsils and retropharyngeal lymph nodes from pigs that had been vaccinated with live attenuated CSFV and/or virulent CSFV. At 5 days postchallenge, there was evidence of significant upregulation of MHC-II but not perforin on NK and γδ T cells, which was observed only following a challenge of the unvaccinated pigs and correlated with increased CSFV replication and IFN-γ expression in both the tonsils and serum. Together, these data suggest that it is unlikely that NK or γδ T cells contribute to the cellular effector mechanisms induced by live attenuated CSFV.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether chimeric pestivirus vaccine candidates (CP7_E2alf, Flc11 and Flc9) are able to protect pigs against clinical signs, and to reduce virus shedding and virus transmission, after a challenge with CSF virus (CSFV), 7 or 14 days after a single intramuscular vaccination. In these vaccine candidates, either the E2 or the Erns encoding genome region of a bovine viral diarrhoea virus strain were combined with a cDNA copy of CSFV or vice versa. Furthermore, currently available serological DIVA tests were evaluated. The vaccine candidates were compared to the C-strain.All vaccine candidates protected against clinical signs. No transmission to contact pigs was detected in the groups vaccinated with C-strain, CP7_E2alf and Flc11. Limited transmission occurred in the groups vaccinated with Flc9. All vaccine candidates would be suitable to stop on-going transmission of CSFV.For Flc11, no reliable differentiation was possible with the current Erns-based DIVA test. For CP7_E2alf, the distribution of the inhibition percentages was such that up to 5% false positive results may be obtained in a large vaccinated population. For Flc9 vaccinated pigs, the E2 ELISA performed very well, with an expected 0.04% false positive results in a large vaccinated population.Both CP7_E2alf and Flc9 are promising candidates to be used as live attenuated marker vaccines against CSF, with protection the best feature of CP7_E2alf, and the DIVA principle the best feature of Flc9. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2013

The underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are still far from being understood, though disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was discussed as a major factor. In the presented study, the direct thrombin inhibitor hirudin was used in an attempt to elucidate the role of the coagulation system in the pathogenesis of CSF-induced haemorrhagic lesions. Two groups of piglets (n=5) were infected with highly virulent CSF virus (CSFV) strain CSF0634. One group underwent daily treatment with hirudin, the other served as untreated challenge infection control. Assessment of clinical signs using a clinical score system, coagulation tests, and blood counts were performed daily. Both groups developed acute-lethal CSF with haemorrhagic lesions.

This research evaluated four newly designed constructions while taking into account our previous work, including the direct implication that a T-cell epitope from the NS3 protein contributes to the generation of the immune response against CSFV. To this end, the dendrimeric constructions, including either this NS3 T-cell epitope alone or two different B-cell epitopes without this T-cell epitope, were used to immunise pigs. Thus, construct 1, containing the NS3 T-cell epitope and four copies of a previously described B-cell epitope, significantly reduced the clinical scores and RNA viral loads after challenge relative to the control group. In three out of six animals in this group, vaccination achieved partial protection and was associated with IFN-gamma producing-cells and neutralising antibodies. In contrast, the pigs immunised with construct 2, again with four copies of the B epitope of construct 1 but lacking the T-cell motif, developed more severe clinical signs. Finally, the additional constructs 3 and 4 included four copies of a B epitope that was different from the epitope used in constructs 1 and 2 with or without the abovementioned NS3 T-cell epitope, respectively. Pigs immunised with these latter constructs developed low levels of peptide-specific antibodies that correlated with equally low levels of cellular responses, an absence of neutralising antibodies and a lack of protection. Even so, the clinical scores in the first week after the challenge were less severe for animals vaccinated with construct 3 than for those given construct 4. Our results confirm the relevant role of the B-cell epitope in residues 694-712 of the glycoprotein E2 (which is used in both constructs 1 and 2) for protection against CSFV, as well as the appropriateness of the newly used NS3 peptide as a specific T-cell epitope in domestic pigs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2012

However, classical swine fever still occurs in some immunized swine herds for various reasons. In this study, we conducted animal experiments to examine the influence of single or mixed infection with Porcine parvo virus (PPV), Pseudorabies virus (PRV) and Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) on the protective immunity induced by the Lapinized hog cholera virus (HCLV) vaccine and the pathogenicity of CSFV. In experiment 1, pigs were first inoculated with PPV, PRV or PRRSV, then immunized with HCLV, and finally challenged with a highly virulent CSFV Shimen strain. All of the pigs immunized with HCLV survived after the challenge, while all of the pigs in the non-immunized control group died after the challenge. The pigs in the group immunized with HCLV did not show any clinical symptoms of classical swine fever and were negative with CSFV after the challenge. The pigs infected with the non-CSFV before HCLV immunization did not display any clinical symptoms after the challenge with CSFV Shiman strain, but 11 of the 12 pigs were positive with CSFV. In experiment 2, pre-infections with PPV, PRV, and PRRSV were followed by inoculation with a low-virulence CSFV strain (CSFV 39), and then the pigs were challenged with the CSFV Shimen strain. Infections by either PPV, PRV or PRRSV did not enhance the virulence of CSFV-39, but pigs infected by a mixture of the 3 viruses developed clinical symptoms after inoculation with CSFV-39. The mixed infection also increased mortality caused by the challenge with the CSFV Shimen strain. Together, these results showed PPV, PRV and PRRSV infections in pigs can reduce the efficacy of the HCLV vaccine and enhance the pathogenicity of CSFV, which may partly explain the immunization failure against CSFV in some swine herds. © 2012 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.",2012

Strain virulence, host characteristics and environment are all factors that markedly influence disease severity. We tested CSFV strains of varying virulence in an experimental set-up, reducing the influence of host and environmental factors. Thus, weaner pigs were inoculated with one of 4 CSFV strains in order to compare the pathogenesis for a 3-week-period after infection. CSFV strains selected were 2 new and 2 previously characterized. None of these strains had been tested in Danish outbred pigs before. Clinical observations grouped the infected pigs into two different categories reflecting either non-specific, mainly gastro-intestinal, problems, or severe disease including high fever within the first week after inoculation. Gross-pathological findings varied between strains, however, lymphoid atrophy and growth retardation represented a consistent finding for all 4 strains. Virus distribution, viral load and in particular virus persistence differed, but supported present practice that recommends lymphoid tissue, most optimal tonsil and lymph nodes, as target material to be applied for early laboratory diagnosis. The present study demonstrated constraints associated with early detection of infections with CSFV strains of low virulence. Since neither clinical symptoms nor pathological lesions observed with these strains constituted characteristic signs of CSF, the risk of neglecting a CSF suspicion is immediate. Therefore, topical information on new outbreaks and continuous enhancement of an efficient surveillance system is of great importance to prevent further spread of CSF within the pig population. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2012

Therefore, new generations of promising marker vaccines have been developed, among them the chimeric vaccine CP7_E2alf. However, in populations previously vaccinated with live attenuated vaccines like the C-strain, passive immunity through maternal antibodies can interfere with efficacy of CP7_E2alf vaccination. Therefore, the efficacy of CP7_E2alf was examined in piglets from sows vaccinated once intramuscularly with C-strain vaccine 4. weeks before farrowing. Thus, these piglets were vaccinated intramuscularly with CP7_E2alf at the age of 5 or 8. weeks. Subsequently, the piglets and their mock-vaccinated littermate controls were challenged 2. weeks post vaccination with highly virulent Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) strain ""Koslov""CP7_E2alf provided clinical protection upon challenge as no severe clinical signs or mortality was observed in the vaccinated piglets. Post mortem examination revealed pathological changes associated to CSFV only in the mock-vaccinated piglets. No infectious CSFV could be isolated from the tonsils of the vaccinated piglets. Two weeks after vaccination at the time of challenge, the vaccinated piglets only, had an increase in the ELISA antibody titer. Interestingly, the maternally derived immunity in the mock-vaccinated control piglets seems to neutralize the challenge virus. Thus, the previously observed 100% mortality in naïve (negative for antibodies to CSFV) piglets infected with CSFV Koslov was reduced in the control piglets of this study to 30% for challenge at the age of 7. weeks and 50% at the age of 10. weeks, respectively. In conclusion, CP7_E2alf proved to be effective in preventing mortality, severe clinical signs and pathological lesions in 5 or 8. weeks old piglets positive for maternal antibodies derived from sows vaccinated intramuscularly 4. weeks before farrowing with one dose of C-strain vaccine. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012

Interestingly, a trend towards a milder presentation of the disease has been observed among the animals during the last years. This study aimed to assess positive selection pressure acting on partial E2 gene of CSF viruses to gain insights into the mechanisms governing virulence and the driving forces of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) evolution in swine populations under regular vaccination. Selection pressure analysis were performed to detect positive selection acting on a particular lineage as well as among sites of the E2-B/C-domain of CSFV nucleotide sequences, reported in a previous study and in the present work, several models, available in the CODEML module of PAML 4.3, were used. In addition, a representative Cuban CSF isolate was assessed in an experimental infection trial for their clinical virulence in order to expand the knowledge regarding CSF viruses circulating in pig populations. The viral genomes sequenced in this study were grouped in a defined cluster within the genotype 1.2, as it has been reported previously for Cuban CSF viruses. The selection pressure analysis didn't find evidence of positive selection (dN/dS of > 1) along any branch. The positive selective pressure analysis estimated six new sites under positive selection on E2 partial gene analysed. Besides, the clinical manifestations of the CSF-disease were related mainly to a mild course of the illness. The high number of positively selected sites suggests that these changes could be associated to viral evasion of the host-immune response. These observations highlight a possible association between escape viral variants and the alterations observed in the virulence and pathogenesis of the virus. Therefore, while the vaccination programs have not led to a genotype change, alterations in virulence were suggested to arise. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2012

The infected animals exhibited mixed cytokine (both TH1 and TH2) responses in the initial phase of the disease. The infected and dead goats had increased IFN-γ response before their death; while IL-4 remained at the base level. The cytokine expression in recovered animals was almost similar to that of vaccinated ones, where a unique biphasic response of IL-4 expression was observed with an up-regulation of IFN-γ on 7th days post vaccination (dpv). Analysis of PPR virus antigen and antibody kinetics in different components of blood from infected and vaccinated animals revealed that the PPR virus antigen load was highest in plasma followed by serum and blood of the infected animals, whereas vaccinated animals showed only marginal positivity on 9th dpv. The antibody titer was high in serum followed by plasma and blood in both vaccinated and infected animals. Therefore, it is inferred that the presence of antigen and antibody were significant with the expression of cytokine, and that a decreased response of IL-4 was noticed during intermediate phase of the disease i.e., 7 to 12th days post infection (dpi).

The protein contains two hydrophobic stretches of amino acids interrupted by a short charged segment that are predicted to form transmembrane helices and a cytosolic loop, respectively. Using reverse genetics, partial in-frame deletions of p7 were deleterious for virus growth, demonstrating that CSFV p7 function is critical for virus production in cell cultures. A panel of recombinant mutant CSFVs was created using alanine scanning mutagenesis of the p7 gene harboring sequential three- to six-amino-acid residue substitutions spanning the entire protein. These recombinant viruses allowed the identification of the regions within p7 that are critical for virus production in vitro. In vivo, some of these viruses were partially or completely attenuated in swine relative to the highly virulent parental CSFV Brescia strain, indicating a significant role of p7 in CSFV virulence. Structure-function analyses in model membranes emulating the endoplasmic reticulum lipid composition confirmed that CSFV p7 is a pore-forming protein, and that pore-forming activity resides in the C-terminal transmembrane helix. Therefore, p7 is a viroporin which is clearly involved in the process of CSFV virulence in swine. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",2012

All protected animals showed quickly rising neutralizing antibodies reaching high titres by the end of the trial. At the end of the trial, the marker ELISA was positive for most challenged animals that survived the CSFV infection (27 out of 30). Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, low level genome detection was seen in all vaccinated animals between days 4 and 10 post challenge infection, but no virus could be isolated from any samples of these animals.

Cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone were used to immunosuppress the animals. The drug treated animals exhibited severe leukopaenia and lymphopaenia; one of the indicators of immunosuppression. Experimental peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) infection was then given to both drug-induced immunosuppressed and non-immunosuppressed goats and observed their effects. Findings indicated that, the immunosuppressed goats had a short period of viremia, more extensive and severe disease advancement and higher mortality rate than the non-immunosuppressed goats. PPRV antigen distribution in both ante-mortem and post-mortem materials was extensive and diffused in immunosuppressed animals than that of non-immunosuppressed. Some of the atypical organ(s)/tissues like liver, kidney, heart etc showed more antigen load than non-immunosuppressed group. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies of tissues from the two groups showed that pathological changes in the non-immunosuppressed animals were confined only to gastrointestinal tract, whereas in the immunosuppressed animals histopathological changes and PPRV antigen distribution were more extensive and diffused.

This has prompted discussions on the use of emergency vaccination to control future CSF outbreaks in domestic pigs. Despite a long history of safe use in endemic areas, there is a paucity of data on aspects important to emergency strategies, such as how rapidly CSFV vaccines would protect against transmission, and if this protection is equivalent for all viral genotypes, including highly divergent genotype 3 strains. To evaluate these questions, pigs were vaccinated with the Riemser® C-strain vaccine at 1, 3 and 5 days prior to challenge with genotype 2.1 and 3.3 challenge strains. The vaccine provided equivalent protection against clinical disease caused by for the two challenge strains and, as expected, protection was complete at 5 days post-vaccination. Substantial protection was achieved after 3 days, which was sufficient to prevent transmission of the 3.3 strain to animals in direct contact. Even by one day post-vaccination approximately half the animals were partially protected, and were able to control the infection, indicating that a reduction of the infectious potential is achieved very rapidly after vaccination. There was a close temporal correlation between T cell IFN-γ responses and protection. Interestingly, compared to responses of animals challenged 5 days after vaccination, challenge of animals 3 or 1 days post-vaccination resulted in impaired vaccine-induced T cell responses. This, together with the failure to detect a T cell IFN-γ response in unprotected and unvaccinated animals, indicates that virulent CSFV can inhibit the potent antiviral host defences primed by C-strain in the early period post vaccination. © 2012 Graham et al.",2012

The aim of this study was to investigate whether PCV2 infection affects the efficacy of the LPC vaccine. Eighteen 6-week-old, cesarean-derived and colostrum-deprived (CDCD), crossbred pigs were randomly assigned to four groups. A total of 10 5.3 TCID 50of PCV2 was experimentally inoculated into pigs through both intranasal and intramuscular routes at 0 days post-inoculation (dpi) followed by LPC vaccination 12 days later. All the animals were challenged with wild-type CSFV (ALD stain) at 27 dpi and euthanized at 45 dpi. Following CSFV challenge, the LPC-vaccinated pigs pre-inoculated with PCV2 showed transient fever, viremia, and viral shedding in the saliva and feces. The number of IgM +, CD4 +CD8 -CD25 +, CD4 +CD8 +CD25 +, and CD4 -CD8 +CD25 + lymphocyte subsets and the level of neutralizing antibodies against CSFV were significantly higher in the animals with LPC vaccination alone than in the pigs with PCV2 inoculation/LPC vaccination. In addition, PCV2-derived inhibition of the CSFV-specific cell proliferative response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was demonstrated in an ex vivo experiment. These findings indicate that PCV2 infection decreases the efficacy of the LPC vaccine. This PCV2-derived interference may not only allow the invasion of wild-type CSFV in pig farms but also increases the difficulty of CSF prevention and control in CSF endemic areas. © 2011 Huang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2011

This study was aimed to create an alternative animal experimental infection model of CSFV. Results: Twenty specific-pathogen-free Bama miniature pigs were randomly divided into two groups and rooms, infected and non-infected, and the pigs in the infected group were inoculated intramuscularly with 10 4, 105 or 106 TCID50(median tissue culture infective dose) CSFV Shimen strain (n = 5 × 3) or left uninoculated to serve as in-contact pigs (n = 3). The uninfected control pigs (n = 2) were housed in a separate room. Clinical signs, body temperature, viraemia, tissue antigen distribution, pathological changes and seroconversion were monitored. Clinical signs were observed as early as 2 days post-inoculation (dpi) in all infected pigs (though mild in contact pigs), but not non-infected control pigs. All inoculated pigs showed viraemia by 6 dpi. The in-contact pigs showed lower levels of viraemia. At 10 dpi, seroconversion was noted in five of the 15 inoculated pigs. All inoculated or one in-contact pigs died by 15 dpi.

The assay had a detection limit of 10. copies/reaction or 3.0 median tissue culture infective dose/reaction.

The immunization of pigs with the DNA vaccine formulation, that contains swine CCL20 chemokine, resulted in the homogenous induction of detectable levels of CSFV antibodies at 36 days after the first injection. Remarkably, immunized animals with E2 DNA vaccine in co-administration with the plasmid containing swine CCL20 developed high titers of neutralizing antibodies against homologous and heterologous CSFV strains and were totally protected upon a lethal viral challenge (sterilizing protection). Our results confirm the role of CCL20 to increase antibody-mediated responses. At the same time suggest the ability of CCL20 to enhance the T helper cell response associated with the induction of neutralizing antibodies against CSFV in pigs previously reported. Systemic replication of virulent CSFV in vivo during the acute phase of infection induces type I IFN. Lower average values of IFN alpha were detected in the serum of pigs immunized with pE2 and pCCL20 at 3 days after challenge. The levels of IFN-alpha detected in pigs immunized with pE2 and principally in non-vaccinated challenged animals can be related to viral load in serum at 3 and 7 days post infection and the clinical signs observed.Our results emphasized the capacity of swine CCL20 chemokine to enhance cellular, humoral and anti viral response with an adjuvant effect in the immune response elicited by E2-DNA vaccination against CSFV. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the adjuvant effect of swine CCL20 to effectively enhance the potential of DNA vaccine in the immune induction and protection against virus challenge in swine infection model. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011

The virus was detectable in pre-clinical animals in whole blood and in different fractions of blood, including white blood cells, red blood cells (RBC), and serum. Based on an in-vitro binding assay, CSFV is retained in the RBC fraction. Naturally occurring PCR inhibitors of whole blood were shown to inhibit detection, and several commercial RNA extraction kits failed to remove these inhibitors. The commercial blood RNA extraction protocols were modified to achieve optimized single tube and high-throughput 96-well plate RNA extraction that efficiently removed PCR inhibitors from whole blood and enhanced detection of CSFV in experimentally inoculated pigs. This enabled detection 1-2 days earlier than observed using unmodified RNA extraction protocols.

E1 and E2 are anchored to the virus envelope at their carboxyl termini, and E rns loosely associates with the viral envelope.

The E1 protein of CSFV strain Brescia contains six cysteine residues at positions 5, 20, 24, 94, 123, and 171. The role of these residues in the formation of E1-E2 heterodimers and their effect on CSFV viability in vitro and in vivo remain unclear. Here we observed that recombinant viruses harboring individual cysteine-to-serine substitutions within the E1 envelope protein still have formation of E1-E2 heterodimers which are functional in terms of allowing efficient virus progeny yields in infected primary swine cells. Additionally, these single cysteine mutant viruses were virulent in infected swine. However, a double mutant harboring Cys24Ser and Cys94Ser substitutions within the E1 protein altered formation of E1-E2 heterodimers in infected cells. This recombinant virus, E1δCys24/94v, showed delayed growth kinetics in primary swine macrophage cultures and was attenuated in swine.

However, we are far from fully understand the distribution, tissue tropism, pathogenesis, replication and excretion of CSFV in pigs. In this report, we investigated the dynamic distribution and tissue tropism of the virus in internal organs of the experimentally infected pigs using real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: A relative quantification real-time PCR was established and used to detect the virus load in internal organs of the experimentally infected pigs. The study revealed that the virus was detected in all 21 of the internal organs and blood collected from pigs at day 1 to day 8 post infections, and had an increasing virus load from day 1 to day 8 post infections. However, there was irregular distribution virus load in most internal organs over the first 2 days post infection. Blood, lymphoid tissue, pancreas and ileum usually contain the highest viral loads, while heart, duodenum and brain show relatively low viral loads. Conclusions: All the data suggest that CSFV had an increasing virus load from day 1 to day 8 post infections in experimentally infected pigs detected by real-time RT-PCR, which was in consistent with the result of the IHC staining. The data also show that CSFV was likely to reproduce in blood, lymphoid tissue, pancreas and the ileum, while unlikely to replicate in the heart, duodenum and brain. The results provide a foundation for further clarification of the pathogenic mechanism of CSFV in internal organs, and indicate that blood, lymphoid tissue, pancreas and ileum may be preferred sites of acute infection. © 2011 Liu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2011

Previously, we demonstrated that pigs immunized with a recombinant adenovirus (rAdV-E2) expressing the E2 glycoprotein of CSFV were protected against virulent CSFV; however, a few pigs showed a short-term fever and occasional pathological changes. To enhance the efficacy of the vaccine, we constructed two recombinant adenoviruses, namely, rAdV-E2UL49, which encodes the CSFV E2 gene fused with the UL49 gene from pseudorabies virus (PRV), and rAdV-optiE2, which expresses the codon-optimized CSFV E2 gene. With these viruses, we performed a comparative immunogenicity trial in rabbits and pigs and compared these recombinant adenovirus vaccines (rAdV-E2UL49 and rAdV-optiE2) with the one containing the wild-type E2 gene (rAdV-E2). In terms of antibody titers, IFN-γ production, lymphocyte proliferation, viral loads and clinical protection from the disease, rAdV-E2UL49 was more immunogenic and protective against C-strain CSFV in rabbits and Shimen strain CSFV in pigs than rAdV-optiE2 and rAdV-E2.

The virus excretion dynamics between these courses are quite dissimilar, but it is not known if this also results in differences in virus transmission. In this study, the excretion and transmission dynamics of the moderately virulent Paderborn strain were studied in 15 one-to-one experiments. In these experiments, a single inoculated pig was housed with a single susceptible contact pig from day 1 post-inoculation (p.i.). Each contact pig that became infected was removed and replaced by a new contact pig at day 17 p.i. and day 26 p.i. Infection of contact pigs was monitored by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR on oropharyngeal fluid samples. Five of the inoculated pigs developed the chronic form or died during the acute phase (high excreting pigs), while 10 pigs recovered from the infection (low excreting pigs). In the first contact period, there was no significant difference in virus excretion between the high and low excreting pigs, while in the second and third contact period, high excreting pigs excreted significantly higher quantities of virus. Over the entire study period, the reproduction ratio differed significantly between the high (143 [56.3-373]) and low excreting pigs (23.1 [11.5-45.0]).

In the present study, we infected 6- and 11-week-old pigs of unique sanitary status with CSFV strain Eystrup to elucidate the influence of age on virulence. In both age-groups, a mild clinical course correlated well with the gross-pathological findings at necropsy. The minor variations of clinical, pathological, haematological and immunological parameters between the various age-groups demonstrated that a time-span of approximately 1 month of age did not play a significant role for the severity of CSF disease in young, weaned pigs. The detailed analysis of various haematological and cellular immunological parameters proved to provide a valuable set of objective reference values for healthy control pigs and for pigs with mild clinical CSF disease. Despite that only mild disease occurred in the infected pigs, modulations of haematological and immunological parameters were observed. Depletion of B cell and a number of T cell populations in peripheral blood was observed in both age-groups, however, the changes being most pronounced in the 6-week-old pigs. In the infected pigs, but not in any of the controls, a population of large granulocytes (LG) developed in peripheral blood. The LG, which were demonstrated to be identical to low-density granulocytes, appeared before the development of viraemia. Therefore, we suggest detection of LDG to be used as an additional tool in early CSF diagnosis. The observation that pigs with a unique, high sanitary status only developed mild disease after infection with CSFV strain Eystrup emphasizes the important role of the host in the CSFV virulence puzzle. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",2010

Pigs vaccinated with E2-CSFV antigen co-formulated with recombinant human alpha interferon were protected against clinical signs and viremia as early as 7 days post-vaccination. It was also demonstrated that interferon stimulates a response of specific anti-CSFV neutralizing antibodies. The present work constitutes the first report of a subunit vaccine able to confer complete protection by the end of the first week after vaccination.

In addition many textbook descriptions of CSF are based on observations of disease caused by historic, mainly genotype 1, strains. Our objective was to improve our knowledge of the diverse range of signs that different CSFV strains can cause by characterising the experimental infection of domestic pigs with both a recent strain of CSFV and a divergent strain. Conventional pigs were inoculated with a genotype 2.1 isolate, that caused an outbreak in the UK in 2000, and a genotype 3.3 strain that is genetically divergent from European strains. This latter strain is also antigenically distinct as it is only poorly recognised by the CSFV-specific monoclonal antibody, WH303. Transmission was monitored by use of in-contact animals. Clinical, virological and haematological parameters were observed and an extended macro- and histopathological scoring system allowed detailed characterisation of pathological lesions. Infection with the genotype 2.1 isolate resulted in a similar outcome to other recent genotype 2 European strains, whereas the genotype 3.3 strain produced fewer and delayed clinical signs, notably with little fever. This strain would therefore be particularly difficult to detect in the early stages of infection and highlights the importance of encouraging early submission of samples for laboratory diagnosis. As representatives of recent and divergent CSFV isolates, these strains are good candidates to study the pathogenesis of current CSFV isolates and as challenge models for vaccine development. © 2009.",2010

For classical swine fever virus (CSFV), immunization with plasmids expressing different versions of glycoprotein E2 has proven an effective way to induce protection. Previously, we have also shown that immunization with DNA vaccine expressing glycoprotein E2 (DNA-E2) induced specific T helper cell responses in the absence of neutralizing antibodies. However, the role of T cell responses in protection against CSFV is largely unknown.Here we have extended these studies to deeply characterize the role of T cell responses by a DNA-E2 and their correlation with protection against CSFV infection. Thus, pigs vaccinated with the DNA vaccine induced a strong cellular immune response, characterized by the specific induction IFN-gamma expressing T cells after vaccination without any detectable levels of CSFV neutralizing antibodies. Constant levels of CSFV-specific IFN-gamma producing cells observed from the beginning of the infection until 7 days after challenge in vaccinated animals might contribute to early control of CSFV replication, at least until neutralizing antibodies are developed.Severe clinical signs of the disease, including high titers of viremia, pyrexia and virus spread to different organs, were recorded in the non-vaccinated challenged animals, in comparison to the vaccinated animals where only one animal showed mild clinical signs and a short peak of viremia. Lack of complete protection in this animal correlated with a delay on the induction of neutralizing antibodies, detectable only from day 11 post-CSFV challenge. Conversely, the rest of the pigs within the group developed neutralizing antibodies as early as at day two post-challenge, correlating with sterile protection. Finally, an inverse correlation seemed to exist between early induction of IFN-alpha and the protection observed, while IL-10 seemed to be differentially regulated in vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals.Our results support the relevance of the induction of a strong T cellular response to confer a solid protection upon DNA vaccination against CSFV. Further experiments are needed to be done in order to clarify the key cytokines playing a role in CSFV-protection and to obtain emergency vaccines capable to confer robust and fast protection. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.",2010

Peripheral blood cells were isolated over the course of vaccination/infection and stimulated . in vitro with C-strain or UK2000/7.1 viruses. Virus-specific responses of peripheral blood cells isolated from C-strain vaccinated pigs were dominated by the production of IFN-γ. IFN-γ production in response to the C-strain virus was first detected in vaccinates 9 days post-vaccination and was sustained over the period of observation.

Furthermore, the level and duration of IL-6 production in the tonsils of pigs intranasally inoculated with NS4B.VGIv were significantly higher than those for animals infected with BICv. The peak of IL-6 production in infected animals paralleled the ability of animals infected with NS4B.VGIv to resist challenge with virulent BICv. Interestingly, treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures with recombinant porcine IL-6 results in a significant decrease in BICv replication.

At present, only live attenuated CSFV vaccines have shown early onset of protection, differing with the recombinant subunit-based vaccines reported so far. Recently, a new vaccine formulation based on E2 envelope viral glycoprotein produced in the milk of goats (E2his) has been shown to induce a highly protective response in pigs against CSFV infection. Pigs immunized with a single dose of this vaccine candidate, formulated as a water-in oil emulsion, elicited an effective response against CSF as early as 7 days post-vaccination. No severe CSF clinical signs were observed and no animals died although the challenge dose was 105 PDL50 of a highly pathogenic CSFV strain. Noticeably, this response completely prevented CSFV infection in pigs when they were challenged under the same conditions 2 weeks after a single dose of the recombinant E2his vaccine formulation. A schedule consisting of a primary immunization with the same vaccine candidate, followed by a booster dose 2 weeks later induced a highly protective response against CSFV infection for as long as 9 months post-vaccination. These promising results demonstrate by far the feasibility of using the E2his-based vaccine in regional programs for preventing and controlling CSF. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2010

We recently demonstrated in a proof of concept study that the molecule has a marked effect on viral replication in CSFV-infected pigs. Here, the effect of antiviral treatment on virus transmission to untreated sentinel pigs was studied. Therefore, BPIP-treated pigs (n = 4), intra-muscularly infected with CSFV, were placed into contact with untreated sentinel pigs (n = 4). Efficient transmission of CSFV from four untreated seeder pigs to four untreated sentinels was observed. In contrast, only two out of four sentinel animals in contact with BPIP-treated seeder animals developed a short transient infection, of which one was likely the result of sentinel to sentinel transmission. A significant lower viral genome load was measured in tonsils of sentinels in contact with BPIP-treated seeder animals compared to the positive control group (p = 0.015). Although no significant difference (p = 0.126) in the time of onset of viraemia could be detected between the groups of contact animals, a tendency towards the reduction of virus transmission was observed. Since sentinel animals were left untreated in this exploratory trial, the study can be regarded as a worst case scenario and gives therefore an underestimation of the potential efficacy of the activity of BPIP on virus transmission. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To gain insight into the interaction between the virus and host cells, microarray analyses were performed to detect alterations in genomic expression of pig peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) following CSFV infection. Three healthy pigs were inoculated with a lethal dose of highly virulent CSFV strain Shimen. PBLs were isolated at the onset of typical clinical signs and total RNA was subjected to microarray analyses with Affymetrix Porcine Genome Array GeneChips. Of all 20 201 pig genes arrayed in the chip, 1745 showed altered expression (up- or downregulation) after infection. These were classified into eight functional groups, relating to cell proliferation (3.6 %), immune response (2.1 %), apoptosis (1.4 %), kinase activity (1.4 %), signal transduction (1.4 %), transcription (0.7 %), receptor activity (0.7 %) and cytokines/chemokines (0.4 %). The remaining 88.3% of genes had unknown functions. Alterations in genomic expression were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR of selected cellular genes and Western blotting of annexin 2, a cellular protein relating to virus infection. The observed expression changes of numerous genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses and in the apoptosis process indicate that CSFV has developed sophisticated mechanisms to cause leukopenia in infected pigs. These data provide a basis for exploring the molecular pathogenesis of CSFV infection through an understanding of the interaction between viral and cellular components. © 2009 SGM.",2009

This study analysed whether the lead compound, BPIP, was able to reduce virus replication in infected piglets. The compound, administered in feed, was readily bioavailable and was well tolerated. Eight specific-pathogen-free pigs received a daily dose of 75 mg kg-1 (mixed in feed) for a period of 15 consecutive days, starting 1 day before infection with the CSFV field isolate Wingene. BPIP-treated pigs developed a short, transient viraemia (one animal remained negative) and leukopenia (three animals did not develop leukopenia). Virus titres at peak viraemia (7 days post-infection) were markedly lower (∼1000-fold) than in untreated animals (P=0.00005) and the viral genome load in blood was also significantly lower (P≤0.001) in drug-treated animals than in untreated animals over the entire experiment. At the end of the experiment (day 33), no infectious virus was detectable in the tonsils of BPIP-treated animals, although low levels of viral RNA were detected. The inability to isolate infectious virus from the tonsils indicates that the risk of a persistent CSFV infection is negligible. Further optimization of the antiviral potency and bioavailability of this lead compound may result in molecules completely suppressing virus replication. A potent antiviral could potentially be used as a primary control measure against virus spread in case of an outbreak, in addition to present countermeasures.

One of the suggested routes is via the air. Under experimental conditions, airborne transmission over a short distance seems possible, but analysis of outbreak data is still inconclusive. For a better understanding of the role of airborne transmission, quantitative information is needed on concentrations of virus emitted by infected pigs. This was studied in four groups of 10 pigs in which three pigs were inoculated with either a low virulent strain (Zoelen), a low or high dose of a moderately virulent strain (Paderborn), or a highly virulent strain (Brescia). The other seven pigs in each group served as contact pigs. At several moments after infection, air samples were obtained using gelatine filters. Infectious virus and viral RNA were detected in the air of rooms housing the pigs infected with the moderately and highly virulent strains with titres of 101.2 to 103.0 TCID50/m3 of infectious virus, and 101.6 to 103.8 TCID50 equiv./m3 of viral RNA. It was observed that the higher the dose or virulence of the virus strain used for inoculation of the pigs, the sooner virus could be detected in the air samples. This is the first study describing the quantification of (infectious) CSFV in air samples of rooms housing infected pigs, enabling to quantify the contribution of individual infected pigs to virus concentrations in aerosols.

However, severity of CSF disease signs may be linked with efficacy of disease transmission, the most severely affected animals having a higher infectivity than the less affected ones. The purpose of this study was to combine disease transmission quantification methods with CSF clinical signs quantification tools to investigate whether clinical signs, considered as infectivity markers, may allow us to calculate reliable estimates for disease transmission parameters. Data from three transmission experiments were used, varying according to the viral strain (Eystrup or Paderborn) and to the contact structure between experimentally inoculated and contact animals (direct or indirect contact). Within- and between-pen basic reproduction ratios (R0) were compared using viraemia data or clinical data. Between-pen R0 estimates were close and not significantly >1, with either strain or computation mode (using viraemia or clinical data). Conversely, within-pen R0s (Paderborn strain) computed using clinical data appeared higher than the estimates obtained using viraemia data. A models comparison (Bayes information criterion) showed a better fit of the clinical-based models, for both strains.

Differences in the viscosity and in the homodimeric form of the antigen were observed after comparing physicochemical properties of stressed and not stressed vaccine formulations. However, these differences did not affect the immunogenicity and protective capacity of such preparations.

The efficiency and speed of the transmission depends on a multitude of parameters, like quantities of virus excreted by infected pigs. This study provides quantitative data on excretion of CSFV over time from pigs infected with a highly, moderately or low virulent strain. For each strain, five individually housed pigs were infected. Virus excretion was quantified in oropharyngeal fluid, saliva, nasal fluid, lacrimal fluid, faeces, urine and skin scraping by virus titration and quantitative Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRRT-PCR). Infectious virus was excreted in all secretions and excretions of pigs infected with the highly and moderately virulent strain, while excretion from pigs infected with the low virulent strain was mostly restricted to the oronasal route. Pigs infected with the highly virulent strain excreted significantly more virus in all their secretions and excretions over the entire infectious period than pigs infected with the moderately or low virulent strains. An exception were the pigs that developed the chronic form of infection after inoculation with the moderately virulent strain. During the entire infectious period, they excreted the largest amounts of virus via most secretions and excretions, as they excreted virus continuously and for a long duration. This study highlights the crucial role chronically infected pigs may play in the transmission of CSFV. Furthermore, it demonstrates the importance of discriminating between strains and the clinical appearance of infection when using excretion data for modelling. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to compare the tissue distribution and pathogenicity of three virulence variants of classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and to investigate the applicability of various conventional diagnostic procedures. Methods. 64 pigs were divided into three groups and infected with the highly virulent isolate ISS/60, the moderately virulent isolate Wingene'93 and the live attenuated vaccine strain Riems, respectively. Clinical signs, gross and histopathological changes were compared in relation to time elapsed post infection. Virus spread in various organs was followed by virus isolation, by immunohistochemistry, applying monoclonal antibodies in a two-step method and by in situ hybridisation using a digoxigenin-labelled riboprobe. Results. The tissue distribution data are discussed in details, analyzing the results of the various diagnostic approaches. The comparative studies revealed remarkable differences in the onset of clinical signs as well as in the development of the macro- and microscopical changes, and in the tissue distribution of CSFV in the three experimental groups. Conclusion. The present study demonstrates that in the case of highly and moderately virulent virus variants the virulence does not affect the pattern of the viral spread, however, it influences the outcome, the duration and the intensity of the disease. Immunohistochemistry has the advantage to allow the rapid detection and localisation of the virus, especially in cases of early infection, when clinical signs are still absent. Compared to virus isolation, the advantage of this method is that no cell culture facilities are required. Thus, immunohistochemistry provides simple and sensitive tools for the prompt detection of newly emerging variants of CSFV, including the viruses of very mild virulence.",2008

The results revealed that oral vaccination has no negative impact on the pregnancy, and all vaccinated sows developed neutralising antibodies. After infection no symptoms were detected in the six vaccinated-infected sows. Challenge virus could neither be found in blood, nasal and fecal swabs or saliva nor in organs sampled at necropsy. Likewise, all fetuses originating from vaccinated sows were virologically and serologically negative. In contrast, the controls developed a short viremia and as a result of the transplacental infection all fetuses were CSFV positive. In addition, 22 serologically positive wild sows of an endemically infected area, where oral vaccination had also been carried out, and their offspring were free from CSFV or viral RNA.

The 12-nt insertion sequence was first found in one attenuated vaccine strain HCLV (Hog Cholera Lapinized Virus) which did not exist in other CSFV strains. To address the function of the 12-nt insertion in viral replication and attenuation, we constructed and analyzed two chimeras stemmed from a highly virulent strain Shimen either with introduction of the 12-nt insertion in 3′ UTR or the replacement of viral 3′ UTR by the 3′ UTR of HCLV. We found that the two chimeras' maximum titers declined approximately 100-fold than their parental strain Shimen in PK15 cells. An animal experiment showed that the two chimeras were both dramatically attenuated in pigs. All the chimera-infected pigs survived infection and remained clinically normal with the exception of a transient fever while the 100% mortality was observed for the Shimen-infected pigs. In addition, the two chimeras can induce neutralization antibody to completely protect the pigs against lethal challenge with highly virulent CSFV, which was similar to the vaccine strain HCLV. These data demonstrate that the 12-nt insertion in 3′ UTR is sufficient for the attenuation of CSFV. Taken together, a novel attenuation mechanism of CSFV is found and may pave a way to further research for new attenuated vaccine. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",2008

Vaccine A was a water-in-oil emulsion containing the E2 glycoprotein originating from the Alfort/Tübingen strain and vaccine B was a water-oil-water emulsion containing the E2 glycoprotein originating from the Brescia strain. Eight groups, of ten pigs each, were vaccinated with either vaccine A or B, intramuscularly (IM) or intradermally (ID). Two different vaccination-challenge intervals were used for each vaccine. Furthermore, one group was vaccinated with a tenfold ID dose of vaccine A and one non-vaccinated group served as a control group. Five pigs from each group were challenged with the moderately virulent CSFV strain Paderborn, while the remaining five pigs served as contacts. Using vaccine A, full transmission to all contact pigs in both ID vaccinated groups occurred. No virus transmission was observed when IM vaccinated pigs were challenged 14 days post-vaccination (14 dpv) whereas only one out of five contact pig became infected when they were challenged 10 dpv. Using vaccine B no virus transmission was observed when pigs were ID or IM vaccinated and challenged 10 dpv. When challenged 3 dpv full transmission occurred in the ID vaccinated group, whereas four out of five contact pigs became infected in the IM vaccinated group.

It is exposed as a homodimer originated by disulfide linkage and represents an important target for the induction of neutralizing immune responses against the viral infection. The E2his glycoprotein nucleotide sequence used in this work contains the CSFV E2 extracellular domain preceded by the tissue plasminogen signal peptide and a hexa-histidine tag in the 3′ terminus. The recombinant antigen was produced at a range of 120-150 μg/mL in the culture media of epithelial kidney pig cells, transduced with a replication defective adenoviral vector (Ad-E2his) generated by means of cloning the E2his sequence in the vector genome. The glycoprotein was obtained from clarified culture media as a homodimer of 110 kDa with purity over 95% after a single affinity chromatography step in Ni-NTA Agarose column. The E2his characterization by lectin-specific binding assay showed the presence of N-linked oligosaccharides of both hybrid and complex types. The protective capacity of E2his was demonstrated in two immunization and challenge experiments in pigs using doses of 15 or 30 μg of the glycoprotein, emulsified in Freund's adjuvant. The intramuscular immunization followed by a unique boost three weeks later, elicited high titers of neutralizing antibodies between the second and the fourth week after the primary vaccination. The immunized animals were fully protected from the viral infection after challenge with 105 PLD50 of homologous CSFV ""Margarita"" strain administered by intramuscular injection. Consequently, no clinical signs of the disease or viral isolation from lymphocytes were detected in the vaccinated pigs.

The air samples were collected from CSFV-infected pigs after experimental aerosolization of the virus. Furthermore, we studied the viability of the virus with time in aerosolized state. Three strains of CSFV were aerosolized in an empty isolator and air samples were taken at different time intervals. The virus remained infective in aerosolized state for at least 30 min with half-life time values ranging from 4.5 to 15 min.

Whereas CD11R1 +CD172a+ cDC frequencies were markedly reduced in blood and spleen, analysis of CD4+CD172a+ pDC numbers revealed a rapid turn-over of this DC subset in tissues pi. Both subsets matured and were activated after infection, as demonstrated by down-regulation of CD1a, up-regulation of the co-stimulation molecule CD80/86 and expression of cytokines. cDC essentially expressed tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin (IL)-10, whereas pDC produced alpha interferon (IFN-α) and IL-12. IFN-α and TNF-α productions revealed an enhancement of innate anti-viral immune responses. Detection of antigen activated B lymphocytes in tonsil T-cell areas at 72 h pi, subsequently to the transient translocation of the viral E2 protein within germinal centres at 48 h pi, indicates the initiation of humoral response. This response was also evidenced by an important IL-10 production in serum one week pi. IL-12 expression in organs, as well as transient detection of IL-18 and IFN-γ in serum, reflected the initiation of cellular immune responses. However, the uncommonly high levels of TNF-α and IFN-α produced by DC and measured in serum early post-infection, together with IL-10 expression in spleen, could play a role in the disruption of immune system cells, either inducing apoptosis or impairing DC functionalities themselves. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2007.",2008

Nineteen 45 days old cross breed pigs of both sexes were divided in three groups. All animals in the first group, originating from sows vaccinated with C-strain vaccine were serologically positive for the presence of specific colostral CSF virus antibodies. The second group consisted of pigs originating from unvaccinated sows serologically negative for CSF virus antibodies. Three healthy pigs serologically negative for the presence of CSF virus antibodies, originating from unvaccinated sows against CSF virus served as a control group. In the group of animals originating from unvaccinated sows against CSF, severe depletion of CD79 positive B lymphocytes was detected. In the group of pigs originating from sows vaccinated with C-strain (CSF virus antibody positive group of pigs), a reduced number of CD79 positive B lymphocytes was detected, but B cells were still present in the periphery of the germinative centres of secondary lymph follicles.

Thus, the establishment of a DIVA vaccine(s) is of pivotal importance for the control of this infectious disease. In this study, recombinant versions of the live-attenuated vaccine strain CSFV Riems were generated by replacing parts of the E2 gene with the corresponding sequence of border disease virus strain Gifhorn. Three cDNA clones were constructed: pRiems-ABC-Gif, pRiems-A-Gif and pRiems-BC-Gif. Infectious particles were obtained from clones pRiems-ABC-Gif and pRiems-BC-Gif only, whereas transfected RNA from clone pRiems-A-Gif behaved like a replicon. Based on its ability to be differentiated in vitro from wild-type CSFV by mAbs, vRiems-ABC-Gif was assessed for immunogenicity and protection against challenge infection in pigs. Before challenge, no CSFV-specific anti-E2 antibodies could be detected with commercial E2-blockihg ELISAs in vRiems-ABC-Gif-vaccinated animals, whereas vRiems-vaccinated pigs developed high titres of anti-E2 antibodies, confirming the marker properties of this vaccine candidate. After oral vaccination, only partial protection against challenge infection was observed in the vRiems-ABC-Gif vaccinees, whereas all intramuscularly vaccinated animals and all vRiems-vaccinated animals were fully protected. These experiments suggest that the strategy of exchanging specific antigenic epitopes among pestiviruses is a promising tool for the development of new CSFV marker vaccines. © 2007 SGM.",2007

Using the new recombinant parapoxvirus (PPV) Orf virus (ORFV) as a vaccine expressing the CSFV E2 glycoprotein we demonstrate that a single intra-muscular application confers solid protection. In the prime only concept, multi-site application of the vector vaccine turned out to be superior to single-site application as no pyrexia occurred after virulent CSFV challenge and CSFV neutralizing serum antibodies regularly were detectable before challenge. Vector virus vaccinated swine were able to cope with the lymphocyte and in particular B-cell depression in peripheral blood after challenge showing no clinical signs and no viremia. Early after challenge CSFV-specific IFN gamma production (IFN-γ) and high neutralizing serum antibody titers clearly differentiated naïve from vaccinated and protected animals. After CSFV challenge neutralizing serum antibodies titers in vector vaccinated swine were significantly higher than those in sera from live attenuated vaccine primed animals. Horizontal challenge virus transmission was prevented under strict sentinel isolation before mingling but not in next-door stables separated by a wooden barrier at the day of challenge. The presence of CSFV-specific pre-challenge serum antibodies although in low titers is a good prognostic parameter for solid protection after ORFV vector vaccination even when a significant CSFV-specific IFN-γ production was not detectable before challenge. A heterologous prime-boost regimen as a combination of prime with baculovirus-expressed glycoprotein E2 followed by boost with the parapoxvirus vector turned out to be a better immune stimulant than a homologous prime/boost with the modified live CSFV vaccine. A similar beneficial effect became evident when the challenge infection mimicked the booster vaccination after a single PPV vector prime. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2007

We observed that rescue of viable virus was completely impaired by removal of all putative glycosylation sites in E2 but restored when mutation N185A reverted to wild-type asparagine produced viable virus that was attenuated in swine. Single mutations of each of the E2 glycosylation sites showed that amino acid N116 (N1v virus) was responsible for BICv attenuation. N1v efficiently protected swine from challenge with virulent BICv at 3 and 28 days postinfection, suggesting that glycosylation of E2 could be modified for development of classical swine fever live attenuated vaccines.

To investigate the importance of BVDV infections in pigs, first we studied the transmission dynamics of a recent BVDV field isolate. Subsequently, the protection of BVD antibodies against transmission and clinical disease of CSF virus was studied. Only limited transmission of BVDV occurred (R = 0.20), while no CSFV transmission occurred in pigs with BVDV antibodies. We concluded that BVDV transmission among pigs is possible, but seems to be limited and thus the virus should disappear from a population if no new introductions occur. Furthermore, the presence of BVD antibodies may completely prevent the transmission of CSFV and therefore could protect pigs against classical swine fever. It was also noticed that double infections with BVDV and CSFV were incorrectly diagnosed using the neutralization peroxidase linked assay (NPLA), which is the golden standard for antibody detection. This might hamper the diagnosis of CSF in herds with a high BVD prevalence. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2006

The Moo Laat (ML) and Large White/Landrace crossbreed (LWC) pigs were inoculated with a standard challenge strain designated Lao/Kham225 (infectivity titre of 102.75 TCID 50/ml). The results demonstrated that both the native breed and an improved pig breed are fully susceptible to CSFV infection and the mortality rate is high. LWC pigs demonstrated lower (or shorter) survival times (50% survival time: 11 days), earlier and higher pyrexia and earlier onset of viraemia compared to ML pigs (50% survival time: 18 days). In the context of village-based pig production, the longer time from infection to death in native ML pigs means that incubating or early sick pigs are likely to be sold once an outbreak of CSF is recognized in a village. This increased longevity probably contributes to the maintenance and spread of disease in a population where generally the contact rate is low. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.",2006

To learn more about the pathogenetic mechanisms of the lesions during CSF in the CNS and to investigate the role of the virus in these mechanisms, cellular infiltrates and infected cells have been characterized. Twenty-eight pigs were inoculated with the virulent CSF virus isolate Alfort 187 and slaughtered from 2 to 15 postinoculation days; 4 animals of similar background served as a control group. Immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and the transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick-end labeling method were used to detect viral antigens and apoptosis. The results showed the presence of nonpurulent meningoencephalitis, occasional microhemorrhages, and apoptosis of the lymphocytes forming the perivascular and interstitital infiltrate in swine with CSF. Macrophages appeared to display little involvement in CNS lesions. The infected cells observed at the early stage of disease were lymphocytes and microglial cells in the rostral portion of the telencephalon, with infection of these cells in other areas in the next stages. The relationship between these lesions and the presence of viral antigen varied according to the type of lesion: hemorrhages were not associated with the presence of antigen in endothelial cells, but infiltrate-cell apoptosis was temporally and spacially associated to viral infection.

Quantitative and qualitative changes in the B-cell population (lambda light chain [C-λ]-positive, immunoglobulins [Ig]-M-positive, and IgG-positive were demonstrated in the spleen, thymus and ileocaecal lymph node. Blood and serum samples were used to examine changes in leucocytes, albumin/globulin ratios and specific antibodies against CSF virus titration. Despite the lymphoid depletion shown by infected animals, an increase in B cells and potentially immunoglobulin-producing C-λ+ plasma cells was observed in the lymphoid organs from the onset of disease. The increase in C-λ+ B cells was matched by a parallel increase in IgM+ cells, which attained peak values from 7 days post-inoculation (dpi), while IgG+ cells increased from 11 dpi onwards. The enhanced biosynthetic capacity of these cells may have been linked to the initiation of a humoral response to CSF virus, and to the progressive decline in the albumin/globulin ratios of inoculated animals. Activation, proliferation and differentiation of B cells coincided with the presence of viral antigen, and with an intense phagocytic and biosynthetic activity of monocytes-macrophages and T lymphocytes. The previously reported increase of cytokine (TNFα, IL-1α and IL-6) production by monocytes-macrophages, and the release of IL-2, IL-4 and IFNγ by T lymphocytes, may play a role in the initiation of the humoral immune response in CSF. These changes may have influenced the late appearance of virus-specific antibodies in the study, as well as the progressive increase of immunoglobulins. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

With vaccines having an importance in disease control, studies are seeking improved protein-based subunit vaccine against the virus (CSFV). In this respect, recombinant viral NS3 protein was analysed for its immunopotentiating capacity, particularly in terms of cytotoxic immune responses. NS3 was effective at inducing in vitro responses, quantified by lymphoproliferation, IFN-γ ELISPOT, flow cytometric detection of activated T cell subsets, and cytotoxic T cell assays. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CSFV-immune pigs could be stimulated, but not cells from naïve animals. In addition to the IFN-γ responses, induction of both CD4+ T helper cell and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTL) were discernible - activation of the latter was confirmed in a virus-specific cytolytic assay. Attempts were made to translate this to the in vivo situation, by vaccinating pigs with an E2/NS3-based vaccine compared with an E2 subunit vaccine. Both vaccines were similar in their abilities to stimulate specific immune responses and protect pigs against lethal CSFV infection. Although the E2/NS3 vaccine appeared to have an advantage in terms of antibody induction, this was not statistically significant when group studies were performed. It was also difficult to visualise the NS3 capacity to promote T-cell responses in vivo. These results show that NS3 has potential for promoting cytotoxic defences, but the formulation of the vaccine requires optimisation for ensuring that NS3 is correctly delivered to antigen presenting cells for efficient activation of CTL. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2005.",2006

Results showed a progressive depletion of splenic lymphoid structures and evidence of platelet aggregation processes. Lymphoid depletion was due to lymphocyte apoptosis, which could not be ascribed to the direct action of the virus on these cells; direct virus action could play only a secondary role in the death of these cells. Absence of severe tissue and endothelial damage, together with moderate procoagulant cytokine levels in the serum, suggest that these pathologies can be ruled out as the cause of platelet aggregation and thrombocytopenia in CSF. Monocyte/macrophages were the main target cells for the CSF virus, and they exhibited phagocytic and secretory activation leading to the synthesis and release of tumor necrosis factor α, which proved to be the chief mediator, followed by IL-6, IL-1α, and C1q complement component.

Maximum detection of viral antigen was observed in the middle stage of the experiment coinciding with overexpression of the three cytokines studied, with IL-6 production by interstitial macrophages prominent at the end. Additionally, the labelling of platelets for Factor VIII-related antigen and the ultrastructural study of the sinusoids revealed activation and aggregation of thrombocytes close to Kupffer cells at the beginning of the infection.

Immunization with three doses of plasmid pcDNA3.1/E2 elicited a consistent and specific, MHC class II restricted T cell response in the three domestic pigs analyzed, in the absence of detectable anti-CSFV antibodies in serum. Upon challenge specific T cell responses were boosted in the three vaccinated pigs, and a rapid rise in the titers of CSFV neutralizing antibodies was noticed in two of them, which correlated with a total protection. In these two pigs, neither disease symptoms were observed nor was virus detected at any time after CSFV infection. Neutralizing antibody titers were lower in the third vaccine, which developed a mild and transient peak of pyrexia. As expected, similar analyses in three control pigs (injected with the empty vector or PBS) did not reveal the induction of specific T cells or viral antibodies and, upon challenge, animals developed severe symptoms of the disease, including high titers of viremia, hyperthermia and virus spread to different organs. Control pigs developed, also, a marked leucopenia, resulting in SWC3+ (myelomonocytic cells) being the major PBMC population, and a drastic decrease CD3+ T cells. This T cell depletion was prevented in animals immunized with pcDNA3.1/E2. The total protection achieved, in the absence of CSFV antibodies before challenge, supports the relevance in the antiviral response observed of specific T cell responses primed by pcDNA3.1/E2 vaccine, which, upon challenge, led to a rapid induction of neutralizing antibodies. The observation that CSFV antibodies could only be detected in protected animals after viral challenge opens the possibility of exploring the potential of the DNA vaccine approach used to develop marker vaccines against CSF. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Oronasal vaccination with 107 TCID50 of either of the two CSF-VRP protected pigs against a challenge with a lethal dose of CSFV strain Eystrup. In contrast, after intradermal vaccination VRP A187-E2del68 but not VRP A187-E2del373 lacking the complete E2 gene induced a protective immune response. We conclude that E2-complemented CSF-VRP have the potential to be used as live-attenuated non-transmissible oral vaccines for pigs. In addition, our data suggest that E2 of CSFV is dispensable for the induction of mucosal but not of parenteral immunity. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2005

The infected pigs were kept in the pens for a period of 15 days after which the pens were depopulated and pigs were killed. At the moment of depopulation, all inoculated pigs were visibly clinically diseased and had high fever. Ten hours later the same pens were repopulated with five pairs of susceptible pigs.

We analyzed the generation of cell-mediated and humoral immune responses in d/d histocompatible pigs following CSFV infection or vaccination. Viral infection induced high T cell responses with high primary and secondary CTL activity correlated with high IFN-γ production, whereas vaccination with a live vaccine followed by infection mainly induced neutralizing antibody but low cell-mediated responses. Moreover, high IgG1 response was associated with high IFN-γ response following infection whereas a weak IFN-γ response was related to a good IgG2 response but a low IgG1 production. These data could reflect Th1/Th2-like balance of immune responses depending upon immunization protocols, which has not yet been described in the pig. T-cell responses to CSFV were evidenced by CSFV-specific CD25 upregulation on CD4-CD8+, but not on CD4+CD8- cells, which further illustrated the importance of CTL responses after infection. Our results indicated that generation of cell-mediated immune responses was much higher following intranasal/oral CSFV infection than after intramuscular vaccination, which implies that the capacity of new CSFV vaccines to induce higher T-cell responses should be considered.",2003

Vascular changes, pathogenic bacteria, and viral infection of epithelial cells were ruled out as causes of necrotic lesions. However, large virally infected monocytes-macrophages with ultrastructural changes indicative of activation were observed in the intestine.

We found that oronasal infection with 104.7 TCID50 produced mortality in three out of five pigs after 29-31 days, and severe clinical symptoms in one out of five pigs, while one out of five pigs exhibited no clinical symptoms. At this infection dose, pigs had viral RNA (monitored by quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR) in serum as soon as 2 days post-infection, and excretion of infectious virus (monitored by sentinel pigs) appeared to be virtually concomitant with viremia onset. While virus RNA was cleared from the serum of most pigs after 1-2 weeks, some pigs had viral RNA in serum for more than 30 days, and exhibited only mild clinical symptoms. We observed an excellent correlation between clinical symptoms and viral RNA loads in serum, while serum antibody levels were low. Clinically affected pigs had up to 1000-fold higher serum viral RNA loads than did pigs without clinical symptoms. At this level of infection, and this age group, the Paderborn isolate exhibited a strikingly wide range of replication patterns, which might be relevant to the spread of the virus through susceptible pig populations, and the severity of the 1997-1998 outbreak. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

All three CSFV-E2 deletion mutants were unable to generate viable virus, indicating that each of the antigenic domains of E2 is essential for viability of CSFV. To rescue the CSFV-E2 deletion mutants SK6 cell lines constitutively expressing glycoprotein E2 of CSFV were generated. The rescued viruses infected and replicated in SK6 cells as demonstrated by expression of viral proteins, but this primary infection did not result in reproduction of infectious virus. Thus, these E2 complemented viruses are considered non-transmissible. In previous experiments, we showed that simultaneous injection of Erns complemented virus (Flc23) via intradermal (ID), intramuscular (IM) or intranasal (IN) routes conferred protection to pigs against a lethal challenge with CSFV [J. Virol. 74 (2000) 2973]. Here, we evaluate different routes of application (ID, IM or IN) with Erns complemented virus Flc23 in order to find the best route for complemented CSFVs. Intradermal injection with Flc23 protected pigs against a lethal CSFV challenge, whereas intramuscular injection induced partial protection, and intranasal injection did not mediate a protective immune response in pigs at all. We used the intradermal route of vaccination to test the E2 complemented viruses. Vaccination of pigs via the intradermal route with the E2 complemented CSFVs also resulted in the induction of antibodies and in (partial) protection against CSFV challenge. Pigs vaccinated with E2 complemented virus Flc4 (deletion B/C domain) survived a lethal CSFV challenge, whereas partial protection was induced in pigs vaccinated with Flc47 (deletion E2) or Flc48 (deletion A domain) E2 complemented viruses.

The massive lymphoid depletion observed in the thymus, may, however, have been associated with the numerical increase in monocytes-macrophages in this organ, and their secretory activation, leading to synthesis and release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1α and C1q complement component as main chemical mediators, and IL-1β and IL-6 as minor mediators. These cytokines (TNF-α and IL-1α) may have played a role in the apoptosis of thymocytes, demonstrated by TUNEL and ultrastructural methods.

To test the vaccines in a ""worst case scenario"", group of 10 weaners were vaccinated using a single dose of an E2 (gp55) based vaccine at days -21, -14, -10 or -7, and subsequently challenged at day 0. The challenge virus was CSFV 277, originating from a recent outbreak of classical swine fever (CSF) in Germany. In all groups, only 5 out of 10 pigs were challenged; the remaining 5 pigs served as vaccinated contact controls. Also, three control groups, each consisting of 10 non-vaccinated pigs, were challenged in parallel to the vaccinated animals. CSFV could be isolated from all non-vaccinated pigs. Among these pigs 40% displayed a chronic course of the infection (virus positive for more than 10 days). Pigs vaccinated 21 or 14 days before challenge displayed no clinical signs of CSFV after challenge. However, they were still able to replicate CSFV when challenged, as measured by reisolation of CSFV from leukocytes of the directly challenged pigs. CSFV could be isolated from the leucocytes of 25% of the pigs vaccinated 21 days before challenge and 50% of the pigs vaccinated 14 days before challenge. Chronic infection was not observed, but transmission to one vaccinated contact pig occurred. From all pigs vaccinated 10 or 7 days before challenge, CSFV could be reisolated. We observed a chronic course of infection in 5% of pigs vaccinated 10 days before challenge and in 30% of pigs vaccinated 7 days before challenge. The mortality rate was 20% in the pigs vaccinated 10 days before challenge, and varied between 20 and 80% in pigs vaccinated 7 days prior to challenge. The contact animals had lower mortality (0-20%) than directly challenged pigs, probably mirroring the delayed time point of infection. There was thus some protection against clinical illness by both marker vaccines, but not a solid protection against infection and virus shedding. The efficacy of the vaccine was best if used 3 weeks before challenge and a clear correlation between time interval from vaccination to challenge and the level of virus shedding was observed. Each vaccine had its own accompanying discriminatory ELISA, but 18% of the virus positive pigs never seroconverted in these tests. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",2001

At the NSFL of Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany experiments were carried out to examine the ability of the vaccines to prevent transplacental transmission of CSF virus. In Belgium and The Netherlands pregnant sows were vaccinated once and challenged with virulent CSF virus 14 days later, which was around day 60 of gestation. At the NSFL in Germany sows were vaccinated twice, on days 25 and 46 of pregnancy and were challenged fourteen days after booster vaccination (day 60 of gestation). Apart from minor inflammatory reactions in some sows, no reactions post vaccination were noticed in either vaccine group. Sows vaccinated with Vaccine A were better protected against clinical CSF than sows vaccinated with Vaccine B. The antibody response after vaccination with Vaccine A was more pronounced than after vaccination with Vaccine B. After single vaccination six out of eight sows vaccinated with Vaccine A and all eight sows vaccinated with Vaccine B had viraemic piglets. After double vaccination one out of four litters from sows vaccinated with Vaccine A and four out of five litters from sows vaccinated with Vaccine B were found to be viraemic. However, both vaccines reduced the transmission probability significantly (Vaccine A: P = 0.004, Vaccine B: P = 0.024) after booster vaccination. However, Vaccine A appeared in this regard more potent as the estimated probability of fetal infections was lower.

A Ser-to-Arg change in the C terminus of envelope glycoprotein Erns (amino acid 476 in the open reading frame of CSFV) is responsible for selection of these HS-binding virus variants (M. M. Hulst, H. G. P. van Gennip, and R. J. M. Moormann, J. Virol. 74:9553-9561, 2000). In this investigation we studied the role of binding of CSFV to HS in vivo. Using reverse genetics, an HS-independent recombinant virus (S-ST virus) with Ser476 and an HS-dependent recombinant virus (S-RT virus) with Arg476 were constructed. Animal experiments indicated that this adaptive Ser-to-Arg mutation had no effect on the virulence of CSFV. Analysis of viruses reisolated from pigs infected with these recombinant viruses indicated that replication in vivo introduced no mutations in the genes of the envelope proteins Erns, E1, and E2. However, the blood of one of the three pigs infected with the S-RT virus contained also a low level of virus particles that, when grown under a methylcellulose overlay, produced relative large plaques, characteristic of an HS-independent virus. Sequence analysis of such a large-plaque phenotype showed that Arg476 was mutated back to Ser476. Removal of HS from the cell surface and addition of heparin to the medium inhibited infection of cultured (SK6) and primary swine kidney cells with S-ST virus reisolated from pigs by about 70% whereas infection with the administered S-ST recombinant virus produced in SK6 cells was not affected. Furthermore, Erns S-ST protein, produced in insect cells, could bind to immobilized heparin and to HS chains on the surface of SK6 cells. These results indicated that S-ST virus generated in pigs is able to infect cells by an HS-dependent mechanism. Binding of concanavalin A (ConA) to virus particles stimulated the infection of SK6 cells with S-ST virus produced in these cells by 12-fold; in contrast, ConA stimulated infection with S-ST virus generated in pigs no more than 3-fold. This suggests that the surface properties of S-ST virus reisolated from pigs are distinct from those of S-ST virus produced in cell culture. We postulate that due to these surface properties, in vivo-generated CSFV is able to infect cells by an HS-dependent mechanism. Infection studies with the HS-dependent S-RT virus, however, indicated that interaction with HS did not mediate infection of lung macrophages, indicating that alternative receptors are also involved in the attachment of CSFV to cells.",2001

Unvaccinated pigs were included in each group to detect transmission of the challenge virus. Three groups of six pigs were vaccinated once and subsequently inoculated with the virulent CSFV strain Brescia after a vaccination-challenge interval of 3, 51/2, 6 or 13 months. All vaccinated pigs, 16 out of 18, with neutralising antibodies against CSFV at the moment of challenge, 3, 51/2, 6 or 13 months later, survived, whereas unvaccinated control pigs died from acute CSF or were killed being moribund. A proportion of the vaccinated pigs did however develop fever or cytopenia after challenge and two vaccinated pigs were viremic after challenge. Virus transmission of vaccinated and challenged pigs to unvaccinated sentinel pigs did not occur in groups of pigs which were challenged 3 or 6 months after a single vaccination. Two out of eight vaccinated pigs that were found negative for CSFV neutralising antibody at 13 months after vaccination died after subsequent challenge.

In Flc9 the 5′ terminal half of the E2 gene of the C-strain, a CSFV vaccine strain, was exchanged with the homologous gene of the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) strain 5250, the Erns gene was exchanged likewise in the chimeric Flc11 virus. Both recombinant vaccines induce an antibody response in pigs that can be distinguished from that induced after a wild-type CSFV infection. Four experiments were performed to estimate the reproduction ratio R after different vaccination-challenge intervals. Each group consisted of ten pigs [specified pathogen free (SPF) pigs or conventional pigs] that were vaccinated once, intramuscularly, either with Flc9 or Flc11 virus or that were not vaccinated. Vaccinated and susceptible pigs were challenged intranasally with the virulent CSFV strain Brescia or Behring, 1, 2 or 4 weeks after vaccination. Whether contact-pigs became infected was determined using a CSFV specific E2 (Flc9) or Erns (FLc11) antibody ELISA. In the unvaccinated control groups, virus secretion started from day 2 to 4 after inoculation and all contact pigs became infected. Contact pigs became infected in the group of pigs (SPF or conventional) vaccinated once with Flc9 virus and challenged 1-, 2- or 4-weeks later. The estimates of the R in the groups challenged at 1-, 2- and 4-weeks after vaccination were 0.38, 0 and 0.75, respectively. Contact infected pigs were not detected (R = 0) in any of the groups of pigs, vaccinated with Flc11, only SPF pigs were used. In order to achieve a statistical significance of R within the vaccinated groups each of the experiments has to be repeated at least once. The R of pigs vaccinated with Flc11 virus and challenged at 1- or 2-weeks after vaccination was however significantly lower that the reproduction ratio of the unvaccinated groups (P = 0.013). The R of pigs vaccinated with Flc9 virus and challenged at 1 (conventional pigs) or 2 weeks (SPF pigs) after vaccination was significantly lower that the reproduction ratio of the unvaccinated groups (P=0.013).

The antigenic region of E2 and/or the complete E(RNS) gene were replaced by the analogous sequence of BVDV II strain 5250. Viable chimeric virus Flc11, in which E(RNS) was replaced, was directly recovered from supernatant of SK6.T7 cells transfected with full- length DNA. Viable chimeric virus Flc9, in which E2 was replaced, resulted in recovery of virus only when SK6.T7 transfected cells were maintained for several passages. However, no virus could be recovered after replacement of both E(RNS) and E2, even after 10 cell passages. Both Flc9 and Flc11 grow in swine kidney cells (SK6), stably maintain their heterologous BVDV sequences and, as assessed by monoclonal antibody typing and radio-immunoprecipitation assays, express their heterologous proteins. Flc9 showed a slower growth rate on SK6 cells than Flc11 and wild-type Flc2 virus. Replacement of E(RNS) or E2 of C-strain-based chimeric viruses did not alter cell tropism compared to wild-type C-strain virus for SK6 and FBE cells. Both Flc9 and Flc11 induced E2 or E(RNS) antibodies, which could be discriminated from those induced after wild-type virus infection, even after repeated vaccination. Furthermore, pigs were completely protected against a lethal CSFV challenge. These results indicate the feasibility of introduction of marker antigens in a live-attenuated marker C-strain vaccine for CSFV. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",2000

Important properties of the vaccine, such as onset and duration of immunity, and prevention of horizontal and vertical transmission of virus were evaluated. A single dose of the vaccine protected pigs against clinical signs of CSF, following intranasal challenge with 100LD50 of virulent classical swine fever virus (CSFV) at 2 weeks after vaccination. However, challenge virus transmission to unvaccinated sentinels was not always completely inhibited at this time point. From 3 weeks up to 6 months after vaccination, pigs were protected against clinical signs of CSF, and no longer transmitted challenge virus to unvaccinated sentinels. In contrast, unvaccinated control pigs died within 2 weeks after challenge. We also evaluated transmission of challenge virus in a setup enabling determination of the reproduction ratio (R value) of the virus. In such an experiment, transmission of challenge virus is determined in a fully vaccinated population at different time points after vaccination. Pigs challenged at 1 week after immunization died of CSF, whereas the vaccinated sentinels became infected, seroconverted for E(RNS) antibodies, but survived. At 2 weeks after vaccination, the challenged pigs seroconverted for E(RNS) antibodies, but none of the vaccinated sentinels did. Thus, at 1 week after vaccination, R&gt;1, and at 2 weeks, R=0, implying no control or control of an outbreak, respectively. Vertical transmission of CSFV to the immune-incompetent fetus may lead to the birth of highly viraemic, persistently infected piglets which are one of the major sources of virus spread. Protection against transplacental transmission of CSFV in vaccinated sows was, therefore, tested in once and twice vaccinated sows. Only one out of nine once-vaccinated sows transmitted challenge virus to the fetus, whereas none of the nine twice-vaccinated sows did. Finally, our data show that the E(RNS) test detects CSFV-specific antibodies in vaccinated or unvaccinated pigs as early as 14 days after infection with a virulent CSF strain. This indicates that the E2 vaccine and companion test fully comply with the marker vaccine concept. This concept implies the possibility of detecting infected animals within a vaccinated population.

In the 7-days interval group and in the control group, virus transmission to all contact pigs occurred, indicating R > 1. Neither in the two 2-week interval groups nor in the 10-day interval group did contact- infections occur. Hence, the estimated R is less than one, which indicates that an epidemic would fade out.

Rabbits were inoculated intravenously with Flc2 or Flc3, the parent C-strain virus, a biologically cloned C-strain or CSF virus strain Brescia (C.1.1.1). After 24-96 h fever was detected in the rabbits inoculated with the different C-strain viruses. Apart from those in the control group, all the C-strain inoculated rabbits had developed CSF virus neutralizing antibodies 4 weeks later and were protected against a parent C-strain challenge. In the second experiment, pigs were inoculated with the parent C-strain or recombinant C-strain virus (Flc2 or Flc3) and then challenged after 4 weeks with the virulent CSF virus strain Brescia. None of the pigs showed clinical signs of classical swine fever after vaccination or challenge, whereas the control pigs developed clinical signs typical for acute CSF. Pigs inoculated with the different C-strain viruses were not viremic after inoculation or challenge, and CSF virus neutralizing antibodies were detected from day 14 onwards. The results from both experiments demonstrated that the two recombinant viruses had retained the biological and immunogenic properties of the parent C-strain in rabbits and pigs.

Renal interstitial oedema and haemorrhages were detected from 7 days post-inoculation (dpi), associated with a slight interstitial mononuclear infiltrate and evidence of viral infection in macrophages and fibroblasts, and in a small proportion of lymphocytes. Viral infection was not detected in capillary endothelial cells. An intense mononuclear infiltrate, with B cells, T cells and small numbers of macrophages, was detected from 10 dpi. In the final phase of the experiment (14 dpi), slight proliferation and degranulation of mast cells were observed. Increased expression of the Clq component of complement was also detected. A significant increase in vascular area was observed from 7 dpi. These results suggest that haemorrhages observed in the kidneys of pigs inoculated with the Quillota strain resulted from erythrodiapedesis and increased vascular permeability, probably aggravated by mast cell degranulation in the final stage of the experiment. The results suggested that mast cell degranulation was linked to activation of the complement system. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.",2000

Several vaccination-challenge experiments were performed to determine the dose that protects 95% of the vaccinated pigs (PD95), and to determine the stability and efficacy of the vaccine several months after production. A single vaccination with a vaccine dose of 32μg E2 - the estimated PD95 - in a water-oil-water adjuvant prevented clinical signs and mortality due to a CSFV challenge-inoculation three weeks after vaccination. Moreover, virus transmission to susceptible sentinel pigs was prevented in nearly all groups of pigs vaccinated with this dose. The vaccine was stable for at least 18 months, and retained its full potency.

Microscopic observations determined that these low density granulocytic cells in the PBMC from CSFV infected animals were indeed immature cells. Both the low density granulocytic cells and monocytes were major targets for CSFV infection in the peripheral blood. This is the first demonstration that low density granulocytic cells dominate the blood leukocyte population during CSF, and that such cells are targets for virus infection. The present work also demonstrates that the leukocyte population changes, such as B lymphocyte depletion and the relative dominance of myeloid cells in the blood during CSF, occur before virus infection of the affected cells.

Recently, this gene was shown to be a functional IκB homolog capable of downregulating NFκB-regulated gene expression. This observation suggests the gene may be of significance to aspects of ASFV pathogenesis and virulence in domestic swine by interfering with a normal antiviral host response. Here we show, using nucleotide sequence analysis, that 5EL is highly conserved among Various African and European pathogenic field isolates and that in all cases its similarity to IκB genes is limited to the presence of four low complexity ankyrin repeats in the ASFV gene. The 5EL gene of Malawi Lit-20/ 1 encodes a 28-kDa protein which was expressed early in virus-infected macrophage cell cultures with maximum levels observed at 3 to 5 hr postinfection. To study gene function, a Malawi Lil-20/1 5EL gene deletion mutant (Δ5EL) was constructed. Growth characteristics of Δ5EL in porcine macrophage cell cultures were indistinguishable from those of the parental virus. And, Δ5EL exhibited an unaltered parental Malawi Lil-20/1 disease and virulence phenotype in domestic swine. Thus, although highly conserved among ASFV isolates, 5EL is nonessential for growth in porcine macrophages in vitro and for viral virulence in domestic swine.

These staining reactions persisted until the last observation on pid 18. Hog cholera virus antigen was not detected in heart tissue at any time. The highest levels of antigen detection were found in tonsils, spleen, and pancreas, although the esophageal mucosa and skin epithelial cells were also intensely and widely stained. The cellular staining pattern of Gp55 had a ubiquitous distribution. It was found in epithelial cells, macrophages and circulating monocytes, endothelial cells, lymphoid cells, and glial cells.

Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood at different days postinfection using this MAb, showed expression of p30 mainly in the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage.

This methodology allowed the quantification of fluctuations in the pool of infected monocyte/macrophage cells in the inoculated pigs, maximum percentages ranging between 6 and 31%. Significant differences in the percentages of cell populations expressing p30 were not found between virulent or attenuated virus infection.

Expression of the NDV F protein in ILTV-ΔgC–F-infected LMH cells was examined with an immunofluorescence assay and western blotting. The F gene was stably maintained in the genome of ILTV-ΔgC–F and the F protein was stably expressed. Compared with the parental virus, ILTV-ΔgC–F demonstrated an increased penetration capacity in vitro, and an increased replication rate in vitro and in vivo. Both the parental virus and ILTV-ΔgC–F were avirulent in chickens. Vaccination of specific-pathogen-free chickens with ILTV-ΔgC–F induced ILTV-specific antibodies, detected with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and provided complete clinical protection against virulent ILTV, although viral shedding and replication were detected in the respiratory tract in the early stage of infection in a very small number of birds. Vaccination with ILTV-ΔgC–F also provided significant protection against challenge with a virulent genotype VII NDV, although the level of NDV-specific antibodies detected with an ELISA was low. Notably, the numbers of birds that were positive for the virulent genotype VII NDV and the replication of the challenge virus NDV in selected target tissues were significantly lower in the ILTV-ΔgC–F-vaccinated chickens than in the control birds.

The mortality, clinical signs, mean death time (MDT), humoral response before and after vaccination, and virus shedding after challenge were evaluated. All vaccination protocols were able to prevent mortality, reduce virus shedding, and induce antibody levels before the challenge at 3 and 4 weeks-old.

We generated a recombinant Newcastle disease virus (rNDV) based on the live-attenuated NDV Clone 30 that expresses the surface protein hemagglutinin (H) of PPRV strain Kurdistan/11 (rNDV_HKur). In vitro analyses confirmed transgene expression as well as virus replication in avian, caprine, and ovine cells. Two consecutive subcutaneous vaccinations of German domestic goats with rNDV_HKur prevented clinical signs and hematogenic dissemination after an intranasal challenge with virulent PPRV Kurdistan/11. Virus shedding by different routes was reduced to a similar extent as after vaccination with the live-attenuated PPRV strain Nigeria 75/1. Goats that were either not vaccinated or inoculated with parental rNDV were used as controls. In summary, we demonstrate in a proof-of-concept study that an NDV vectored vaccine can protect against PPR. Furthermore, it provides DIVA-applicability and a high thermal tolerance. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2020

Despite the intensive applications of vaccines, disease outbreaks caused by those viruses continue to occur frequently even among the vaccinated poultry farms. An important factor in the suboptimal protective efficacy of the current vaccines is the genetic mismatch between the prevalent strains and the vaccine strains. Therefore, in the present study, an effective and stable genotype-matched live attenuated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine was developed using reverse genetics, based on a recently isolated virulent naturally recombinant NDV IBS025/13 Malaysian strain. First of all, the sequence encoding the fusion protein (F) cleavage site of the virus was modified in silico from virulent polybasic (RRQKRF) to avirulent monobasic (GRQGRL) motif. The entire modified sequence was then chemically synthesized and inserted into pOLTV5 transcription vector for virus rescue. A recombinant virus termed mIBS025 was successfully recovered and shown to be highly attenuated based on OIE recommended pathogenicity assessment indices. Furthermore, the virus was shown to remain stably attenuated and retain the avirulent monobasic F cleavage site after 15 consecutive passages in specific-pathogen-free embryonated eggs and 12 passages in one-day-old chicks. More so, the recombinant virus induced a significantly higher hemagglutination inhibition antibody titre than LaSota although both vaccines fully protected chicken against genotype VII NDV induced mortality and morbidity. Finally, mIBS025 was shown to significantly reduce both the duration and quantity of cloacal and oropharyngeal shedding of the challenged genotype VII virus compared to the LaSota vaccine. These findings collectively indicate that mIBS025 provides a better protective efficacy than LaSota and therefore can be used as a promising vaccine candidate against genotype VII NDV strains. © 2020 by the authors.

Moreover, in a trial to study the effect of EOs on vNDv genotype VII in vivo as a preventive or therapeutic measure, 2 additional ND-vaccinated groups were used (PRV: medicated 1 D before vNDv challenge for 5 D; and TTT: medicated 2 D after vNDv challenge for 5 D). In addition, the immune-modulatory effect of EOs on the avian influenza (AI), infectious bronchitis (IB), and infectious bursal disease (IBD) vaccines was assessed through the serological response. The use of EOs along with administration of ND vaccines (VTC) revealed a lower mortality rate (42.86%), clinical signs, and postmortem lesion score (11) than ND vaccines alone (VC) (52.28% mortality and score 15), in addition to lower hemagglutination inhibition (P &lt; 0.05) (6.5 ± 0.46) and viral shedding (10 log 2.28 ± 0.24) titres 1 wk after challenge in comparison with VC (8.63 ± 0.65 and 10 log 3.29 ± 0.72, respectively).

Virulent NDV strains (GM) induce large quantities of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), which is the central mediator of the inflammatory reaction. Excessive expression of IL-1β exacerbates inflammatory damage. Therefore, exploring the mechanisms underlying NDV-induced IL-1β expression can aid in further understanding the pathogenesis of Newcastle disease. Here, we showed that anti-IL-1β neutralizing antibody treatment decreased body temperature and mortality following infection with virulent NDV. We further explored the primary molecules involved in NDV-induced IL-1β expression from the perspective of both the host and virus. This study showed that overexpression of NLRP3 resulted in increased IL-1β expression, whereas inhibition of NLRP3 or caspase-1 caused a significant reduction in IL-1β expression, indicating that the NLRP3/caspase-1 axis is involved in NDV-induced IL-1β expression. Moreover, ultraviolet-inactivated GM (chicken/Guangdong/GM/2014) NDV failed to induce the expression of IL-1β. We then collected virus from GM-infected cell culture supernatant using ultracentrifugation, extracted the viral RNA, and stimulated the cells further with GM RNA. The results revealed that RNA alone was capable of inducing IL-1β expression. Moreover, NLRP3/caspase-1 was involved in GM RNA-induced IL-1β expression. Thus, our study elucidated the critical role of IL-1β in the pathogenesis of Newcastle disease while also demonstrating that inhibition of IL-1β via anti-IL-1β neutralizing antibodies decreased the damage associated with NDV infection; furthermore, GM RNA induced IL-1β expression via NLRP3/caspase-1. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020

Aims: This study evaluates the plausible effect of prior or post challenge vaccination with a live commercial vaccine on some pathogenic aspects of velogenic Newcastle disease virus (vNDV) infection in broilers with an emphasis on elucidating type I interferons (IFNs) response trends. Methods: Chicks (n=250) were randomly allocated into 5 equal groups including negative control (NC), positive control (PC) (challenged with vNDV), and treatment (T1-T3) groups: (T1) only received Villegas-Glisson/University of Georgia (VG/GA) strain of NDV vaccine, (T2) vaccinated 24 h prior to vNDV challenge, and (T3) vaccinated 24 h post vNDV challenge. Samples from trachea, cloacal content, and serum were collected at different time points to evaluate virus shedding or IFNs levels. Results: Although clinical signs and lesions were not completely blocked by administration of vaccine prior to or post vNDV inoculation, the disease severity diminished as demonstrated by an increase in bird’s survival rate and median survival days (MSDs). Moreover, prior to or post challenge VG/GA live vaccine administration, modified viral shedding patterns by decreasing the vNDV shedding period especially from the gastrointestinal (GI) system. Strong early type I IFNs response was observed in the trachea and sera of chickens vaccinated prior to or post-infection (pi) as compared to birds that received vaccine or vNDV alone. In trachea, IFN-α response was more pronounced than IFN-β, while both IFNs showed a considerable change in serum. Conclusion: It seems that vaccination after challenge with vNDV can improve bird’s health similar to prior administration and reduces virus shedding which may be due to type I IFNs production. © 2020 Shiraz University.

Despite the intensive vaccination regimes of NDV in Egypt, many outbreaks are being reported. The present study focused on the preparation and evaluation of inactivated velogenic Newcastle disease virus vaccine (genotype VII) isolated from Egyptian broiler chicken during 2015-2016. Fifty-five tissue samples including trachea, lung, liver, proventriculus, intestine, and kidney collected from commercial broiler chickens were used for virus isolation in specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs (ECE) and identified using RT-PCR and sequencing. The isolates were classified by sequencing as velogenic NDV genotype VIId containing F0 protein cleavage site motifs (112RRQKRF117). A selected isolate was served as a master seed for the preparation of inactivated NDV vaccine with or without Montanide ISA70 adjuvant and evaluated in SPF chicks. Nine NDV isolates were isolated on ECE and the highest infectivity titer of the virus was 7.50 log10 EID50 mL-1 by the 5th passage. Vaccinated chicks with NDV-Montanide ISA70 adjuvanted vaccine exhibited antibody titer of 5.20 log2 at the 3rd-week-post-vaccination (WPV) with the highest titer (8.90 log2 mL-1) at the 6th-WPV. Protective antibodies values were persisted to 12th WPV followed by a gradual decrease to the end of the experiment (16th weeks). Vaccination of chicks with inactivated NDV isolate without adjuvant failed to induce protective HI antibodies all over the experiment. Chickens vaccinated with the ISA70 adjuvant vaccine were passed homologous challenge tests with 100% protective efficiency, while the unadjuvanted vaccine could not provide any protective efficiency. In conclusion, the preparation of inactivated oil adjuvant vaccine from NDV field circulating strains was efficient in controlling the disease in Egypt. © 2020, Urmia University.

Class II genotype VII NDV are predominant in the Middle East and Asia, despite intensive vaccination programs using conventional live and inactivated NDV vaccines. In Egypt, the disease is continuously spreading, causing severe economical losses in the poultry industry. In this study; the protective efficacy of a commercial, inactivated recombinant genotype VII NDV–matched vaccine (KBNP-C4152R2L strain) against challenge with the velogenic NDV strain (Chicken/USC/Egypt/2015) was evaluated in commercial layers. Two vaccination regimes were used; live NDV genotype II (LaSota) vaccine on days 10, 18, and 120, with either the inactivated NDV genotype II regime or inactivated NDV genotype VII–matched vaccine regime on days 14, 42, and 120. The 2 regimes were challenged at the peak of egg production on week 26. Protection by the 2 regimes was evaluated after experimental infection, based on mortality rate, clinical signs, gross lesions, virus shedding, seroconversion, and egg production schedule. The results show that these 2 vaccination regimes protected commercial layer chickens against mortality, but some birds showed mild clinical signs and reduced egg production temporarily. However, the combination of live NDV genotype II and recombinant inactivated genotype VII vaccines provided better protection against virus shedding (20% and 0% vs. 60% and 40%) as assessed in tracheal swabs and (20% and 0% vs. 20% and 20%) in cloacal swabs collected at 3 and 5 D post challenge (dpc), respectively. In addition, egg production levels in birds receiving the inactivated NDV genotype VII–matched vaccine regime and in those given inactivated genotype II vaccines were 76.6, 79, 82, and 87.4% and 77.7, 72.5, 69, and 82.5% at 7, 14, 21, and 28 dpc, respectively. The results of this study indicate that recombinant genotype-matched inactivated vaccine along with a live attenuated vaccine can reduce virus shedding and improve egg production in commercial layers challenged with a velogenic genotype VII virus under field conditions. This regime may ensure a proper control strategy in layers. © 2019",2020

Hepatitis-hydropericardium syndrome (HHS), caused by virulent fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV-4), is another highly infectious disease in chickens with severe economic impact. The effective way to combat ND and HHS is by vaccinating the poultry. In the present study, a recombinant NDV LaSota vaccine strain expressing full length fiber-2 gene of FAdV-4 (rLaSota-fiber2) was generated using reverse genetics. The FAdV-4 fiber-2 protein was expressed as a soluble form rather than NDV membrane-anchored form. The rLaSota-fiber2 was genetically stable, and it showed growth patterns in embryonated eggs comparable to that of parental rLaSota virus. Since our unpublished data demonstrated that delivery of live rLaSota-fiber2 in drinking water or ocular delivery of the vaccine didn't produce protection against hypervirulent FAdV-4 challenge, even though the vaccine provide full protection against NDV challenge, the efficacy of the rLaSota-fiber2 was evaluated by delivering the vaccine intramuscularly in this study. Single-dose intramuscular vaccination of 2-week-old SPF White Leghorn chicks with the live or inactivated rLaSota-fiber2 provided complete protection against virulent NDV challenge. However, single-dose intramuscular vaccination with the live rLaSota-fiber2 vaccine provided better protection against virulent FAdV-4 challenge and significantly reduced faecal viral shedding comparing to the inactivated vaccine.

In Belgium, 20 cases were diagnosed, of which 15 occurred in hobby flocks, 2 in professional poultry flocks and 3 in poultry retailers. The disease also disseminated from Belgium towards the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg by trade. Independently, the virus was detected once in the Netherlands, almost simultaneously to the first Belgian detection. As such Newcastle disease emerged in the entire BeNeLux region. Both the polybasic sequence of the fusion gene cleavage site and the intracerebral pathotyping assay demonstrated the high pathogenicity of the strain. This paper represents the first notification of this specific VII.2 subgenotype in the North-West of Europe. Time-calibrated full genome phylogenetic analysis indicated the silent or unreported circulation of the virus prior to the emergence of three genetic clusters in the BeNeLux region without clear geographical or other epidemiological correlation. The Dutch strain appeared as an outgroup to the Belgian and Luxembourgian strains in the time-correlated genetic analysis and no epidemiological link could be identified between the Belgian and Dutch outbreaks. In contrast, both genetic and epidemiological outbreak investigation data linked the G.D. Luxembourg case to the Belgian outbreak. The genetic links between Belgian viruses from retailers and hobby flocks only partially correlated with epidemiological data. Two independent introductions into the professional poultry sector were identified, although their origin could not be determined. Animal experiments using 6-week- old specific pathogen-free chickens indicated a systemic infection and efficient transmission of the virus. The implementation of re-vaccination in the professional sector, affected hobby and retailers, as well as the restriction on assembly and increased biosecurity measures, possibly limited the epizootic and resulted in the disappearance of the virus.

In this study, we isolated a subgenotype XIIb NDV strain, Goose/CH/GD/E115/2017 (E115), from geese in Guangdong province, Southern China, in 2017. Phylogenetic analysis showed that E115 and six other NDVs from geese in China were grouped under subgenotype XIIb and were distinct from subgenotype XIIa, isolated from chickens in South Africa, and subgenotype XIId, isolated from chickens in Vietnam. To better understand the pathogenicity and transmission of the subgenotype XIIb NDVs from geese in Guangdong province, we inoculated chickens and geese with 106 EID50 of the E115 virus. Eight hours after inoculation, three naïve chickens and three naïve geese were co-housed with the infected chickens or geese to assess intraspecific and interspecific horizontal transmission of the E115 virus. The E115 virus induced significant clinical signs without mortality in chickens, while it was not pathogenic to geese. Intraspecific and interspecific horizontal transmission of the E115 virus was observed among chickens and geese via direct contact. Furthermore, although the current vaccines provided complete protection against disease in chickens after challenging them with the E115 virus, the virus could also be transmitted from vaccinated chickens to naïve contact chickens. Collectively, our findings highlight the need for avoiding the mixing of different bird species to reduce cross-species transmission and for surveillance of NDV in waterfowl. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2020

Both vaccinated and unvaccinated poultry flocks have experienced Newcastle disease virus (NDV) genotype VII outbreaks within the last few years. This study was performed to investigate the pathogenesis of NDV genotype VII in different organs of broiler chickens. Fifty, 1-day-old chicks were divided into 2 equal groups with 25 animals in each group. Group 1 served as the non-infected (negative control) group, while group 2 was infected by intranasal inoculation of 0.1 ml containing 106 EID50 of NDV genotype VII. Three chicks were sacrificed from each group at 2, 5, and 10 days post-infection (dpi). Tissue sections from the nasal conchae, larynx, trachea, lungs, heart, kidneys, and brain were collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) was also performed on the tracheal samples. The infected group showed severe respiratory signs and had greenish-colored diarrhea. Mortalities were 6, 4, 6, and 2 chicks at 5, 6, 7, and 9 dpi, respectively. Grossly, congestion of the mucosa of the trachea and larynx was recorded at 5 dpi. Histopathological examination of different organs revealed tracheitis, pneumonia, laryngitis, nephritis, brain perivascular cuffing, and neuronal degeneration. NDV antigen was detected by IHC in all examined organs except the brain. Strong viral antigen expression by IHC was observed at 5 and 7 dpi in most of the studied organs. Viral antigen expression was also detected in the endothelial cells of blood vessels, cilia, surface epithelium, and goblet cells of the nasal conchae, larynx, and trachea in addition to the cytoplasm of cardiomyocytes and in the epithelium lining the renal tubules. © 2020, Brazilian Association of Veterinary Pathology.

However, the cellular proteins of the central nervous system (CNS) involved in avian neurotropic virus infection have not been completely elucidated. Here, we employed a gene microarray to identify caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 11 (CARD11), a lymphoma-associated scaffold protein presenting brain-specific upregulated expression in a virulent neurotropic Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-infected natural host. Chicken primary neuronal cells infected with NDV appeared slightly syncytial and died quickly. CARD11 overexpression inhibited viral replication and delayed cytopathic effects; conversely, depletion of CARD11 enhanced viral replication and cytopathic effects in chicken primary neuronal cells. The inhibition of viral replication by CARD11 could not be blocked with CARD11-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome and NF-κB signaling inhibitors. CARD11 was found to interact directly with the viral phosphoprotein (P) through its CC1 domain and the X domain of P; this X domain also mediated the interaction between P and the viral large polymerase protein (L). The CARD11 CC1 domain and L competitively bound to P via the X domain that hindered the P-L interaction of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex, resulting in a reduction of viral polymerase activity in a minigenome assay and inhibition of viral replication. Animal experiments further revealed that CARD11 contributed to viral replication inhibition and neuropathology in infected chicken brains. Taken together, our findings identify CARD11 as a brainspecific antiviral factor of NDV infection in avian species. IMPORTANCE Newcastle disease virus (NDV) substantially impacts the poultry industry worldwide and causes viral encephalitis and neurological disorders leading to brain damage, paralysis, and death. The mechanism of interaction between this neurotropic virus and the avian central nervous system (CNS) is largely unknown. Here, we report that host protein CARD11 presented brain-specific upregulated expression that inhibited NDV replication, which was not due to CARD11-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) complex-triggered activation of its downstream signaling pathways. The inhibitory mechanism of viral replication is through the CARD11 CC1 domain, and the viral large polymerase protein (L) competitively interacts with the X domain of the viral phosphoprotein (P), which hampers the P-L interaction, suppressing the viral polymerase activity and viral replication. An in vivo study indicated that CARD11 alleviated neuropathological lesions and reduced viral replication in chicken brains. These results provide insight into the interaction between NDV infection and the host defense in the CNS and a potential antiviral target for viral neural diseases. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.",2019

To overcome this, genotype-matched vaccines have been proposed. To date, this approach has never been tested against genotype XII strains. In this study, we generated and assessed the protection against genotype XII challenge of two chimeric NDV vaccine strains (rLS1-XII-1 and rLS1-XII-2). The rLS1-XII-1 virus has the complete fusion protein (F) and the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) open reading frames replaced with those from genotype XII strain NDV/peacock/Peru/2011 (PP2011) in a recombinant LaSota (rLS1) backbone. In rLS1-XII-2 virus, cytoplasmic tails of F and HN proteins were restored to those of rLS1. In vitro evaluation showed that rLS1-XII-2 and the parental rLS1 strains replicate at higher efficiencies than rLS1-XII-1. In the first vaccine/challenge experiment, SPF chickens vaccinated with rLS1-XII-1 virus showed only 71.3% protection, whereas, rLS1 and rLS1-XII-2 vaccinated chickens were fully protected. In a second experiment, both rLS1-XII-2 and the commercial vaccine strain LaSota induced 100% protection. However, rLS1-XII-2 virus significantly reduced viral shedding, both in the number of shedding birds and in quantity of shed virus. In conclusion, we have developed a vaccine candidate capable of fully protecting chickens against genotype XII challenges. Furthermore, we have shown the importance of cytoplasmic tails in virus replication and vaccine competence. © 2019 Izquierdo-Lara et al.

Though vaccine is being used to protect the birds from infection, outbreaks even in vaccinates are not uncommon throughout the year. Here, we assessed infectious potential of field prevailing NDV and IBV strains in broiler birds and determined a varying clinical exhibition and tissue tropism upon exposure to each of the virus either alone or in combination. At the age three week, the broiler chickens (n = 210) were divided into six groups (35 birds per group). These were group A (NDV-alone challenged), B (IBV-alone challenged), C (NDV+IBV-sequentially challenged), D (IBV+NDV-sequentially challenged), E (NDV and IBV-simultaneously challenged) and F (negative control). The birds were challenged with 10-5.76 and 10-6.03 EID50 dose of NDV and IBV, respectively. Tissue samples were taken from the infected birds after 2nd, 4th and 6th day post inoculation (dpi) for histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Clinical examination revealed a more severe form of respiratory infection in birds exposed with IBV, whereas, both respiratory and nervous signs were evident among birds infected with NDV. However, compared to birds infected with each of virus, severity of infection was much more in birds co-infected with both viruses. A variable degree of microscopic changes such as congestion and haemorrhages were observed in the trachea, lungs, proventriculus, caecal tonsil and kidney tissues. Evidenced through immunohistochemistry, the presence of antigen across various tissues of the birds indicated a wide spectrum of host tissue tropism for each of the virus where it was maximum in co-infected groups (C, D and E) than individual virus (groups A and B). The study concludes the currently prevailing strains are much pathogenic and that the presence of one virus facilitates further enhancement infection-associated tissue damage as a result of co-infection. © 2019, Pakistan Agricultural Scientists Forum.

We developed a recombinant construct based on the herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) as a vector expressing two genes: F and HN (HVT-NDV-F-HN) derived from the AAvV-1 genotype VI (“pigeon variant” of AAvV-1). This recombinant viral vaccine candidate was used to subcutaneously immunize one group of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens and two groups of broiler chickens (20 one-day-old birds/group). Humoral immune response was evaluated by hemagglutination-inhibition test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The efficacy of the immunization was assessed in two separate challenge studies performed at 6 weeks of age with the use of virulent AAvV-1 strains representing heterologous genotypes IV and VII. The developed vaccine candidate elicited complete protection in SPF chickens since none of the birds became sick or died during the 2-week observation period. In the broiler groups, 90% and 100% clinical protection were achieved after challenges with AAvV-1 of IV and VII genotypes, respectively.

As a lymphoid organ, the bursa of Fabricius (BF) plays a pivotal role in destroying invading pathogens. Virulent NDV strains can cause rapid atrophy of the BF; however, there is limited knowledge regarding the BF innate immune response to NDV infection. In this study, we used the virulent NDV strain F48E9 to infect four-week-old chickens and found atrophy of the BF, with severe damage and high NDV viral loads after NDV infection in dying chickens. To better understand the interactions between the host and NDV, we compared the transcriptional profiles at 48 and 72 h following infection with the virulent NDV strain F48E9 using RNA-seq. We identified a total of 1498 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were enriched in a variety of biological processes and pathways according to Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. The enriched pathways were associated with innate immune and inflammatory responses as well as metabolism-related signalling pathways. Excessive inflammatory and innate immune responses induced by the NDV strain may be related to severe BF damage. The global survey of changes in gene expression performed herein provides new insights into complicated molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between NDV and chickens and will enable the use of new strategies to protect chickens against NDV. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019

Since, the virus has affected 401 backyard and four commercial flocks, and one live bird market in California, and one backyard flock in Utah. The pathogenesis and transmission potential of this virus, along with two genetically related and widely studied viruses, chicken/California/2002 and chicken/Belize/2008, were evaluated in both 3-week- and 62-week-old chickens given a low, medium, or high challenge dose. All three viruses were highly virulent causing clinical signs, killing all the chickens in the medium and high dose groups, and efficiently transmitting to contacts. The three viruses also replicated in the reproductive tract of the adult hens. Virus shedding for all viruses was detected 24 hours after challenge, peaking with high titers at day 4 post challenge. Although not genetically identical, the studied isolates were shown to be phenotypically very similar, which allows the utilization of the available literature in the control of the current outbreak. © 2019",2019

Here, we constructed two recombinant DEVs expressing the F protein (rDEV-F) or HN protein (rDEV-HN) of NDV. We then evaluated the protective efficacy of these recombinant DEVs in specific-pathogen-free chickens. rDEV-F induced 100% protection of chickens from lethal NDV challenge after a single dose of 10 4 TCID 50 , whereas rDEV-HN did not induce effective protection. rDEV-F may therefore serve as a promising vaccine candidate for chickens.

In the current study, we compared the early immune responses in chickens infected with two strains of velogenic NDV, a duck origin, named GD strain (Md/CH/LGD/1/2005, genotype VIId), and an chicken origin, F48E9 strain (genotype IX). The viral RNA level of GD strain was significantly higher than those of F48E9 in most tissues of chicken. Furthermore, the high level of viral RNA of the GD strain was associated with a stronger immune response compared to that of F48E9, characterized by upregulated expression of some of avian β-defensins and cytokines, most of toll-like receptors, and some of the other immune-related genes investigated. This study thus demonstrated differences in host early immune responses to the two NDV strains. Further studies are needed to characterize the basic molecular mechanisms involved in the host responses in chickens infected by the two NDV strains. © 2018 The Authors.

Many researchers have revealed that vaccines closely matched to epidemic viruses provide better protection. Therefore, using a previously established reverse genetics system, we generated a recombinant NDV vaccine strain (rLa Sota-HN) based on the La Sota vaccine strain expressing the haemagglutinin–neuraminidase (HN) protein of genotype VII NDV. The pathogenicity of the recombinant virus was confirmed by the mean death time in 9-day-old specific-pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs and the intracerebral pathogenicity index in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens. Subsequently, 1-day-old chickens were immunized with commercial vaccine La Sota and recombinant virus rLa Sota-HN and then challenged with virulent genotype VII NDV strain. The results indicated that recombinant virus rLa Sota-HN provided increased protection of vaccinated chickens from morbidity and mortality, and inhibited the shedding of virulent virus after challenging with genotype VII virus, compared with the conventional vaccine La Sota.

However, reports of Newcastle disease (ND) outbreaks caused by genotype VIII strains of NDV are rare. In this study, a virulent genotype VIII strain of NDV, designated GXGB2011, was isolated from a vaccinated game fowl flock showing clinic signs of infection in Pinxiang county, Guangxi, China. The whole genome of the isolate was completely sequenced and was found to be comprised of 15,192 nucleotides (nt), encoding the six structural proteins in the order of 3′-NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5′. The pattern of cleavage site 112 RRQKR↓F 117 in the fusion (F) protein and the intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) value of 1.5 showed that the strain GXGB2011 was a velogenic NDV. The results of the challenge experiment with the 5-week-old SPF chickens showed that the strain was highly pathogenic with 100% morbidity and mortality of the challenged birds. Based on the detection of virus in different organs of the infected birds, the highest viral load in caecal tonsils was observed and viral levels in immune organs were higher than those in the respiratory organs. Bayesian reconstruction of complete genomes based on the sequences of 66 NDV reference strains showed that the strain belonged to the genotype VIII of NDV. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the strain was more closely related to the foreign strains gamefowl/U.S.(CA)/24225/98, 1ITTY94060 and IT-147/94 rather than to the first domestic strains of the emergence genotype VIII in Qinghai, China during 1979–1985. In summary, the results of the study demonstrated the re-emergence of a highly pathogenic virulent isolate of genotype VIII of NDV. These results indicate the risk that this genotype VIII of NDV may spread to commercial chickens from game fowl. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2019

ND is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in pigeons. Most studies investigating NDV in pigeons have focused on the epidemiology and pathogenicity of the virus. However, the host immune responses in pigeons infected with NDVs remains largely unclear. In this study, we investigated the host immune responses in pigeons infected with two NDV stains, a pigeon paramyxovirus type 1(PPMV-1) strain, GZH14, and a genotype II virus, KP08. Although no mortality was observed upon infection with either virus, obvious neurological effects were observed in the GZH14-infected pigeons but not in the KP08-infected pigeons. Both viruses could replicate in the examined tissues, namely brain, lung, spleen, trachea, kidney, and bursa of Fabricius. The expression level of RIG-I, IL-6, IL-1β CCL5, and IL-8 were up-regulated by both viruses in the brain, lung and spleen at 3 and 7 days post-infection. Notably, these proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines showed more intense expression in the brain, when induced by the GZH14 strain than with the KP08 strain. These results indicate that the intense inflammatory responses induced by PPMV-1 in the brain may be a critical determinant of neurological symptoms in pigeons infected with PPMV-1. Our study provides new insight into the pathogenicity of PPMV-1 in pigeons attributable to the host immune responses. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2019

The control of ND relies on proper vaccination strategies. The vaccine strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) mainly belong to genotype I, II or III, which cannot fully prohibit virus shedding against the prevalent genotype VII virulent strain attack. To develop a safe, genotype matched vaccine candidate, we employed a bac-to-bac expression system and constructed a genotype VII NDV strain based virus-like particles (NDV VLPs). It was constructed with NDV M protein as the skeleton, and protective antigen F and HN proteins displayed on the surface. The NDV VLPs exhibited a similar appearance to the live NDV particles, but with denser F and HN proteins displayed on the surface. The immunization assay indicated that NDV VLPs stimulated a longer protection period, less tissue virus loading and shorter virus shedding period than the commercialized LaSota-formulated vaccine when challenged with genotype VII NDV strain. These results proposed the potential role of NDV VLPs as an alternative to current live genotype unmatched vaccine for the control and eliminate NDV in the avian flocks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2019

The mortality of IM infected chickens and pigeons was 10/10 for chickens and 8/15 for pigeons, while the mortality of IN infected chickens and pigeons was 7/10 for chickens and only 1/15 for pigeons. The concentration of viral shedding in the oropharynx was higher than that in the cloaca for both IN and IM infected pigeons. Pigeons infected IN continued shedding the virus from the oropharynx from the 4th day post-infection (dpi) up to the 16th dpi, while IM infected pigeons stopped oropharyngeal shedding at the 11th dpi. Chickens in contact with infected pigeons developed severe respiratory, digestive and nervous signs. The mortality rates in chickens in contact with IM and IN infected pigeons were 2/5 and 3/5, respectively.

All broiler chickens and 8/15 pigeons were killed when infected intramuscularly (IM), while 7/10 chickens and only 1/15 pigeons were killed when infected intranasally (IN) with the virus in an experimental setting. Chickens in contact with infected pigeons developed severe respiratory, digestive and nervous signs. The mortality rates in chickens in contact with IM and IN infected pigeons were 2/5 and 3/5, respectively. Chickens in contact with IM infected pigeons had higher viral shedding titres than those in contact with IN infected pigeons. Free-range pigeons are considered an efficient carrier and transmitter of NDV-VIId to commercial broiler chickens raised in open houses. Newcastle disease is an acute fatal disease of poultry. The aim of this study was to determine the dynamics of the transmission of avian avulavirus (velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease-genotype VIId) from either intramuscularly (IM)- or intranasally (IN) infected 8-week-old Egyptian Baladi pigeons in contact with commercial Arbor Acres broiler chickens (4 weeks of age). The mortality of IM infected chickens and pigeons was 10/10 for chickens and 8/15 for pigeons, while the mortality of IN infected chickens and pigeons was 7/10 for chickens and only 1/15 for pigeons. The concentration of viral shedding in the oropharynx was higher than that in the cloaca for both IN and IM infected pigeons. Pigeons infected IN continued shedding the virus from the oropharynx from the 4th day post-infection (dpi) up to the 16th dpi, while IM infected pigeons stopped oropharyngeal shedding at the 11th dpi. Chickens in contact with infected pigeons developed severe respiratory, digestive and nervous signs. The mortality rates in chickens in contact with IM and IN infected pigeons were 2/5 and 3/5, respectively. Chickens in contact with IM infected pigeons showed higher viral shedding titres in both the oropharynx and cloaca than chickens in contact with pigeons infected IN.

The ND accounts for heavy losses in Iranian poultry flocks. There are some reports regarding the epidemiology of this infection in Iran. This study was performed to investigate the infection of turkeys with a Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolated from a broiler chicken flock in southwestern Iran during 2013. For the purpose of the study, 70 day-old Wishard bronze poults were allocated into two groups of control (n=25) and infected (n=45). At 32 days of age, each bird in the infected group was inoculated with 0.1 mL (50 µL per eye) of NDV-infected allantoic fluid through an ocular route and received 105 EID50 of viral inoculum. On the other hand, the birds in the control group were inoculated with phosphate buffered saline by the same route. Swab samples were taken from both groups at different time points, namely from 1 to 21 days postinoculation, and verified for NDV infection by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Both groups were also examined serologically by haemagglutination inhibition test. Clinically, the infected turkeys exhibited anorexia, severe depression, sitting on the hock joint, white to greenish (sometimes bloody) diarrhea, neurological disorders, and mild respiratory problems. Out of 45 inoculated birds, 9 (20%) cases died. Based on RT-PCR, virus shedding was observed in the challenged birds 3-8 days postinoculation. The NDV was detected more in tracheal swabs (50%) than in cloacal swabs (12.5%). The infected birds showed a high seroconversion. Therefore, the NDV circulating in Iranian chicken flocks has the potential to cause a serious illness in commercial turkeys. The vaccination of turkeys, as well as biosecurity, should be considered carefully to prevent the ND outbreaks in the future. © 2019 Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute.

Materials and Methods: A virulent NDV field isolate Gianyar-1/AK/2014 was propagated in chicken-embryonated eggs and was then inactivated with BEI at a concentration of 4 mM. Three groups of chickens with low-level (2 log2 hemagglutination inhibition [HI] units) maternally derived antibodies against NDV were then immunized with the BEI-inactivated vaccine. A commercial live vaccine (LaSota strain) was used as positive control, and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used as negative control. A challenge experiment with a virulent NDV of Tabanan-1/ARP/2017 was performed at 3 weeks post-vaccination. Results: At 2 weeks post-immunization, the mean titers of antibodies against NDV in serum samples of chickens immunized with 0.2 mL of BEI-inactivated NDV (Group I), with live commercial NDV vaccine (Group II) and with PBS (Group III) were 3±0.94 log2 HI units, 4.9±0.99 log2 HI unit, and 0.0±0.0 HI units, respectively. At week 3 post-immunization, the mean titers of the antibodies for the three groups were 5±1.09 log2 HI units, 6.9±0.32 log2 HI units, and 0.00 HI units, respectively. The antibody titer induced by inactivated NDV Gianyar-1/AK/2014 isolates examined at 2 and 3 weeks post-vaccination was still at a significantly (p&lt;0.01) lower level as compared to those induced by commercial life vaccine. However, the challenge test with virulent NDV of Tabanan 1/ARP/2017 isolates showed that all immunized chickens (Group I and II) survived without exhibiting any clinical sign post-challenge with the protection rates of 100%, whereas all chickens injected with PBS (Group III) died with clinical signs of ND. Conclusion: This finding shows that the BEI-inactivated vaccines prepared using virulent NDV of Gianyar-1/AK/2014 strain was able to induce protective antibody response in chickens but still at a lower level than those induce by commercial live NDV vaccine. © Adi, et al.",2019

Different live and inactivated NDV vaccines were used throughout the experiment including; ND-HB1,Elite, LaSota, Inactivated GII and Inactivated GVII. Broiler chicks were divided into 8 groups; 6 groups undergo different vaccination programs against NDV while two groups were kept without vaccination to be the control groups. Challenge was done at day 30th of age via intranasal administration of NDV velogenic GVII (NDV/CK/Egypt/567F/2012). Abs titers were determined at days 1, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days of the experiment. The obtained results of shedding titers of NDV clarified that the lowest shedding titer was recorded in group vaccinated by HB + double shots of Inactivated GVII + Elite + LaSota and HB + double shots of Inactivated GII + Elite + LaSota, then group vaccinated by HB + one shot of Inactivated GVII + Elite + LaSota and HB + one shot of Inactivated GII + Elite + LaSota at days 3, 5, 7 and 9 post challenge day at 30th, respectively compared to those vaccinated by live vaccines HB + LaSota only and HB + Elite + LaSota only. Also, no mortalities (100% protection rate) were recorded in groups vaccinated with both live and inactivated NDV vaccines compared to low mortality rates recorded in groups vaccinated with live vaccines only. Based on the recorded results, it was concluded that application of ND vaccination programs containing both live and double inactivated vaccines (either GII or GVII) was found to be more effective than those depending on one shot of inactivated vaccine (either GII or GVII) plus live vaccines and more effective than program including live vaccines only. © 2019 Mousa A.

We constructed a US9-deleted ILTV mutant based on this avirulent ILTV, and then constructed a recombinant ILTV (designated ILTV-ΔUS9-F) expressing the fusion protein (F) of the genotype VII NDV based on the US9-deleted ILTV mutant. Expression of the F protein in ILTV-ΔUS9-F-infected cells was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence assay and western blotting. The inserted F gene was stably expressed in ILTV-ΔUS9-F. The growth kinetics of ILTV-ΔUS9-F were comparable to those of the wild-type ILTV strain. Vaccination of SPF chickens with ILTV-ΔUS9-F produced no clinical signs but did induce low levels of NDV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and neutralizing antibodies. A single vaccination with 10 4 plaque-forming units (PFU) of ILTV-ΔUS9-F provided good protection against both genotype VII and IX NDVs based on clinical signs, similar to the protection provided by the commercial live La Sota vaccine. Notably, ILTV-ΔUS9-F limited the replication and shedding of genotype VII NDV from oropharyngeal swabs more efficiently than the La Sota vaccine. In addition, vaccination with lower doses (10 3 and 10 2 PFU) of ILTV-ΔUS9-F also provided sufficient clinical protection.

While extensive vaccination programs have been implemented in ND-endemic countries, the disease is continuously spreading in commercial, backyard, and wild captive poultry. In order to investigate the evolution of the virus and assess the efficiency of the vaccine regimens that are currently being applied in commercial poultry, four wild-bird-origin NDV strains were characterized biologically, based on mean death time and intracerebral pathogenicity index, and genetically, based on the cleavage motif (112RRQKRF117) in the fusion (F) protein. Based on these features, all of the isolates were characterized as velogenic strains of NDV. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete genome sequence revealed clustering of these isolates within class II, genotype VII. This class of NDV remains the predominant genotype in the Egyptian poultry industry, as well as in those of many Asian and African countries. To investigate the potential of these wild-bird-origin NDV isolates to cause infection in domesticated poultry and to assess the efficacy of currently available vaccines for protection of commercial poultry, an extensive animal challenge experiment was performed. Cumulative clinicopathological and immunological investigations of virus-challenged chickens indicate that these isolates can potentially be transmitted between chicken and cause systemic infections, and the currently applied vaccines are unable to prevent clinical disease and virus shedding. Taken together, the data represent a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of Egyptian wild-bird-origin NDV strains to cause infection in commercial poultry and highlights the need for a continuous and large-scale surveillance as well as revised vaccine approaches. These integrated and multifaceted strategies would be crucial in any efforts to control and eradicate the disease globally. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",2018

In the experiment, 1-day-old pathogen-free Hubbard chicks were divided into five groups and all groups except control were received live LaSota vaccine. The chicks were re-vaccinated at day 5 and were given oil-adjuvanted inactivated vaccines prepared from one of four different inactivated NDV strains including SFR-55 (genotype-VIIi), Chicken-12 (XIIIb), Mukteswar (III), and LaSota (II), and control group was treated with PBS only. Pre- and post-challenge serum was collected from all groups and tested for antibody against NDV using hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay. After challenged with virulent SFR-55, the birds were examined daily for morbidity and mortality and were monitored at selected intervals for viral shedding. All the vaccines induced high immune response, and all the groups except the control induced > 84% protection against vNDV challenge. The vaccine genetically and antigeneically similar with challenge NDV strain reduced oral shedding significantly as compared to mismatched strains.

These vaccines were all derived from NDV strains isolated around 70 years ago. Since then, class II NDV strains have evolved into 18 genotypes. Whether the vaccination failure results from genotype mismatches between the currently used vaccine strains and field-circulating velogenic strains or from an impaired immune response in the vaccination remains unclear. To test the first hypothesis, we performed a heterologous genotype II vaccine/genotype XI challenge in one-day old specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks and reproduced viral shedding. We then produced two attenuated strains of genotype II and XI by reverse genetics and used them to immunize two-week old SPF chickens that were subsequently challenged with velogenic strains of genotypes II, VII and XI. We found that both vaccines could induce antibodies with hemagglutination inhibition titers higher than 6.5 log2. Vaccination also completely prevented disease, viral shedding in swabs, and blocked viral replication in tissues from different genotypes in contrast to unvaccinated chickens that died shortly after challenge.

Unfortunately, their role during Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection remains obscure. Previous study has reported the development of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) known as 28-4, which is specifically directed against the CD3- IEL-NK cells. In the present study, we used this mAb to investigate the effects of velogenic and lentogenic NDV infection on avian IEL-NK cells. Our findings revealed that chickens infected with velogenic NDV strains have a reduced population of purified CD3-/28-4+ IEL-NK cells as determined by flow cytometry. Furthermore, the CD3-/28-4+ IEL-NK cells from chicken infected with velogenic NDV strains were shown to have a downregulated expression of activating receptors (CD69 and B-Lec), effector peptide (NK-LYSIN), and IFN gamma. On the contrary, the expression of the inhibitory receptor (B-NK) and bifunctional receptor (CHIR-AB1) were upregulated on these purified CD3-/28-4+ IEL-NK cells following velogenic NDV infection. Meanwhile, the lentogenic NDV demonstrated insignificant effects on both the total population of CD3-/28-4+ IEL-NK cells and the expression of their surface receptors. In addition, using real-time PCR and transmission electron microscopy, we showed that CD3-/28-4+ IEL-NK cells were susceptible to velogenic but not lentogenic NDV infection. These findings put together demonstrate the ability of different strains of NDV to manipulate the activating and inhibitory receptors of CD3-/28-4+ IEL-NK cells following infection.

However, the mechanism for this unique pathological phenotype is not fully understood. Previous transcriptomics data showed that genotype VII NDV JS5/05 caused a greater downregulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) genes than genotype IV virus Herts/33 in the spleen. In this study, the role of ECM in pathology of genotype VII NDV was investigated using quantitative proteomics. Pathology studies showed that JS5/05 caused severe immunopathology characterized with remarkable necrosis in the spleen, whereas Herts/33 only induced mild pathological changes. The ECM was firstly enriched from the spleens and ECM proteins of different categories were identified by LC-MS/MS. Quantitative proteomic analysis showed that JS5/05 caused a significant disruption of ECM integrity and molecular composition compared to Herts/33. Particularly, JS5/05 induced a more remarkable collagen breakdown in the spleen compared to Herts/33. Moreover, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 and -14 were significantly upregulated by JS5/05 infection. KEGG pathway analysis suggested that differential regulation of ECM proteins by JS5/05 and Herts/33 may impact pathology through different pathways. Therefore, our results suggested that MMP upregulation and consequent ECM degradation contribute to immunopathology of genotype VII NDV in the spleen. Significance: Pathogenesis of genotype VII NDV is characterized with severe immunopathology in the spleen in chickens. Elucidating the mechanism of this pathology phenotype is critical to understand pathogenesis of genotype VII NDV. Here, we present the proteomic data of an important non-cellular compartment, the extracellular matrix (ECM), in the spleen from chickens infected with genotype VII and IV NDVs. Our results suggest that significant upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases by genotype VII NDV and consequent disruption of ECM integrity and composition may be associated with immunopathology in the spleen. Moreover, ECM degradation, represented by collagen breakdown, is an important pathology event in the process of genotype VII NDV infection. Our study for the first time presents evidence of ECM regulation by NDV and adds ECM remodeling as a new manifestation for NDV pathology. Our findings also deepen the understanding of NDV pathogenesis. © 2018",2018

The modified recombinant virus had similar growth characteristics as rNDV-R2B, but was less virulent in susceptible chickens. Immunization of the recombinant attenuated virus to one week of age SPF chickens generated a protective immune response with a substantial reduction in virus shed after challenge with virulent NDV. The results of the study indicate that the modified rNDV-R2B-FPCS virus can be used for primary immunization in birds without any adverse reactions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018

While the majority of research has been dedicated to each virus in particular, including biological, molecular and vaccine aspects of development, the impact of dual-virus infection has attracted less attention. To fill this gap, we conducted the present study on NDV vaccinated commercial adult layers that were housed in isolators for challenge with velogenic NDV (vNDV). The assessment of commercial birds is innovative, as no studies have been performed to resolve this issue in commercial birds using experimentally-controlled challenge and molecular survey. The dual-virus infection was carried out with avian influenza, subgroup H9N2, 4 days before the challenge with vNDV, which is the most prevalent scenario in Israeli commercial poultry, at the time of conducting the study. The first trial employed SPF chicks to titrate the vNDV challenge; the second trial explored the efficacy of the commercial vaccination against NDV in 30 weeks-old Lohmann layers, and the third experimental infection trial analyzed systematically the impact of dual virus-infection on 35 week-old Hyline vaccinated layers with NDV vaccine. In the trials that employed commercial layers the birds were protected against morbidity and mortality, but they still shed vNDV at low levels, probably reflecting the actual situation in many commercial flocks in Israel. No effect by the prior infection of commercial layers with AIV H9N2, followed by vNDV were observed, neither on the NDV shedding, antibody titers to both viruses and nor the rates of mortality and morbidity. © 2018, Israel Veterinary Medical Association.

Two hundred and forty Isa-Brown pullets were divided randomly into vaccinated and unvaccinated groups (n = 120 each). The vaccinated group was given Hitchner B1 vaccine at 1 day of age, La Sota vaccine at 4 weeks of age and Komarov vaccine at 9 and 16 weeks of age. At the peak of egg production, the laying hens (32 weeks old) were assigned randomly into four groups (n = 60): VC, vaccinated with ND vaccines and inoculated intramuscularly with velogenic viscerotropic ND virus (vvNDV); VU, vaccinated unchallenged; UC, unvaccinated challenged; and UU, unvaccinated unchallenged. UC hens showed depression, diarrhoea and later torticollis. Mortality in UC hens was 90%. VC hens showed mild anorexia. The body weights of the UC hens were significantly (P <0.05) lower than those of UU hens. VC and UC hens showed a significant (P <0.05) drop in egg production. Only UC hens produced abnormal eggs and initially had swollen, oedematous, hyperaemic oviducts followed by atrophy and shortening of the reproductive tract with atresia of the ovarian follicles. The histopathological changes were of necrosis of the epithelium and secretory glands. VC hens showed mild inflammatory changes in the oviduct. Immunohistochemical labelling showed extensive presence of the virus in the ovary, infundibulum, magnum, isthmus, uterus and vagina of UC hens and in the ovary of VC hens. These changes will be the cause of serious egg production problems, especially in vaccinated layers in countries where vvNDV is enzootic. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018

Sialic acid (SA) has been considered as a receptor for NDV infection and determining tissue tropism. The neurotropic mechanism of NDV in birds is completely unknown. Here we have investigated the role of viral receptor SA in neurotropism of NDV in chickens. We determined that α2,3- and α2,6-linked SA receptors were implicated in NDV encephalitis and viral binding to primary neuronal cells using immunohistofluorescence and virus-cell binding assay. Both SA receptors were found to co-localize with velogenic strain F48E9 in neuropathological lesions of chicken brains after infection through intraocular-nasal routes. The replication of velogenic F48E9 in primary neuronal cells was more efficient than that of lentogenic strain LaSota. The virus-neuronal cell binding capabilities of both the velogenic and the lentogenic strains have no difference. Furthermore, the cell-binding capability and the replication of both strains were significantly decreased by pretreatment with sialidases in neuronal cells. These results demonstrated that α2,3- and α2,6-linked SA receptors were important for the initiation of NDV infection in the chicken nervous system.

In recent years, a high mortality has been observed in ND-infected pigeons in China. Mortality is from 40% to 80% or 100% in some cases. Methods: The full-length genomes of four pigeon paramyxovirus type 1 (PPMV-1) strains, which were isolated from infected pigeons in China in 2012 and 2013, were sequenced and analyzed to determine the phylogenetic characteristics of PPMV-1 circulating in pigeons of China in recent years. Furthermore, cross hemagglutination inhibition and cross virus neutralization assays, as well as animal experiments were conducted to determine the antigenicity and pathogenicity of those viruses. Proteolytic cleavage sites (residues 112-117) of the F proteins were identified as the typical virulence motif, 112RRQKRâ "" F117 for all four PPMV-1 strains investigated. Results: Phylogenetic analysis based on sequences of complete genomes and F gene revealed that the four PPMV-1 isolates and most of recent isolates in China were highly homologous to European isolates from 1998 to 2011. All those isolates were clustered in one clade of genotype VI NDV, termed as subgroup 4bii f. The R value was calculated based on cross hemagglutination inhibition and cross virus neutralization results, and confirmed antigenic difference of the PPMV-1 strains isolated in 2013 from the LaSota vaccine strain. Several mutations were identified in the surface glycoproteins F and HN, which probably gave rise to those antigenic differences. Conclusion: Our result suggested that the PPMV-1 strain prevailing in China in the last decade diverged from a common ancestor and was presumably transmitted from Europe. PPMV-1 isolates displayed obvious antigenic differences from vaccine strain LaSota. Even though PPMV-1 did not cause high mortality in experimental pigeons, the infected pigeons were exhibiting viral shedding for 3 weeks after infection, suggesting PPMV-1 is a potential threat to NDV control worldwide. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017

For this purpose, single vNDV and sequential H9/NDV challenges were performed with increasing doses of vNDV (101–106 EID50). The H9N2 challenge made birds more susceptible to the vNDV, lowering the minimum dose required to cause an infection, exacerbating the clinical outcome, while delaying the onset of the disease and time of death.

The vaccine viruses that are used in many countries include the LaSota and other live viruses that were isolated in the early and late 1950s. Reports from several laboratories including ours indicate a greater variance of the circulating strains and recent classification indicates the existence of XVIII different genotypes of NDV strains. The efficiency of the LaSota vaccination in inducing protective immunity to different heterologous strains has been a question and its efficacy upon exposure to a virulent genotype IV strain has not been reported after 1989 world-wide except for India. Serum antibody negative (SAN) chicks of either sex obtained by hatching specific-pathogen-free (SPF) eggs were vaccinated with increasing doses of the vaccine virus from 101 to 107 EID50 per bird delivered through occulo-nasal route and challenged 20 days later with NDV-2K3 (genotype IV) strain of virus isolated in the year 2000 from pigeon in India. The birds were monitored for serum antibody titers and following challenge for morbidity, mortality, viral load in the cloacal swab and different tissues. We could clearly show that a minimum vaccine titre of 104 EID50 could establish protective antibody levels and also prevent viral replication post challenge upon exposure to the virulent genotype IV strain. We conclude based on our results and previous observation that there do exist differences in the levels of the antibody that could limit viral replication and shedding upon exposure to different heterologous genotype of NDV. Developing a strain matched vaccine might less potential to result in better protection by limiting the viral shedding. © 2017, Indian Virological Society.",2017

One of these virus isolates, Meredith/02, was shown to induce only very mild clinical signs with no mortalities in an experimental setting, in contrast to the velogenic Herts 33/56 and Texas GB isolates.

Results: The depletion of IgM+ cells and infiltration of macrophages were observed to be higher in bursa infected with AF2240 as compared to IBS002.

In addition, higher pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine gene expression such as chicken CXCLi2, IL-18 and IFN-γ were observed in AF2240 infected bursa. Depletion of IgM+ cells was further confirmed with increased cell death and apoptosis of the cells in AF2240 infected bursa as compared to IBS002. However, it was found that the viral load for NDV strain IBS002 was comparatively higher than AF2240 although the magnitude of the pro- inflammatory cytokines expression and cell apoptosis was lower than AF2240. Conclusion: The results of our study demonstrated that infection of NDV strains AF2240 and IBS002 caused apoptosis in bursa IgM+ cells and its severity was associated with increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokine, macrophage infiltration and oxidative stress as the infection duration was prolonged. However, of the two viruses, we observed that NDV AF2240 induced a greater magnitude of apoptosis in chicken bursa IgM+ cells in comparison to IBS002. This might be due to the high level of oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines/chemokine as well as lower IL10 expression which subsequently led to a high rate of apoptosis in the chicken bursa of Fabricius although the detected viral load of AF2240 was lower than IBS002. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017

Here, we observed the adjuvanticity of the bacterial ghost (BG) on the effectiveness of inactivated NDV vaccine in a chicken model. We found that BG, as an adjuvant with inactivated NDV vaccine, substantially strengthened the ND-specific antibody response and protection against lethal challenge in a chicken model, reduced viral shedding, strengthened the time duration of antibody titers, produced an available immunization effect with a low dose of vaccine, and improved serum IL-2 and IFN-γ concentrations.

Vaccination is an effective way to prevent and control the spread of ND virus (NDV) and H9N2 AI virus (AIV), but the antigenic differences between the current circulating strains and the vaccine strains might account for recent ND and H9N2 AI outbreaks in vaccinated poultry flocks. Methods: We developed an inactivated bivalent H9N2 and NDV vaccine based on the current prevalent strains of H9N2 AIV and NDV in China and evaluated its efficacy in chickens in this study. Results: The results indicated that the inactivated bivalent vaccine could induce a fast antibody response in vaccinated chickens. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titer in the sera increased rapidly, and the highest HI titer was observed at 4 weeks post-vaccination (wpv) with a mean titre of 8.6 log2 for NDV and 9.5 log2 for H9N2. Up until 15 wpv, HI titers were still detectable at a high level of over 6 log2. The immunized chickens showed no signs of disease after challenge at 3 wpv with the prevalent strains of NDV and H9N2 AIV isolated in 2012-2014. Moreover, viral shedding was completely inhibited in vaccinated chickens after challenge with H9N2 AIV and inhibited by at least 90% with NDV compared to the controls at 5dpc. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the inactivated NDV and H9N2 vaccine induces a fast and strong antibody response in vaccinated chickens and is efficacious in poultry against NDVs and H9N2 AIVs. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017

Thirty-week-old specific pathogen free (SPF) egg-laying hens were inoculated with the velogenic genotype VIId NDV strain (infected group) or with inoculating media without virus (control group) by combined intraocular and intranasal routes. The levels of CaBP-D28k mRNA expression in the uterus, a gene related to eggshell quality, were examined by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The quality of eggshells was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The infected group showed a marked decline in egg production when compared to the control group. The NDV antigen was found more abundantly in the glandular epithelium of the infected hens’ uteri from 1 to 15 d post-inoculation (dpi). The levels of CaBP-D28k mRNA expression in the uteri of infected hens were significantly lower than in the control hens from 3 to 15 dpi (P < 0.05). The changes in the Ca concentrations in the eggshells were consistent with the expression of CaBP-D28k mRNA in the infected hens. Ultrastructural examination of eggshells showed significantly reduced shell thickness in the infected hens from 1 to 15 dpi (P < 0.05). Furthermore, obvious changes in the structure of the external shell surface and shell membrane were detected in the infected hens compared with the control hens.

In this study, we systematically analysed the antigenic variation between genotype VII NDV aSG10 and the commercial vaccine strain LaSota, and assessed their efficacy against challenge with velogenic NDV by serological analysis and animal testing. We show that these two viruses are antigenically distinguishable; anti-NDV aSG10 hyper-immune sera demonstrated higher haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres (11.13 ± 0.30log2) against the aSG10 virus, compared with titres against LaSota (9.53 ± 0.50log2). Conversely, the hyper-immune sera from LaSota showed higher HI titres against LaSota virus (9.73 ± 0.36log2), but 2-fold lower HI titre against aSG10 (8.87 ± 0.38log2). Each serum neutralised heterologous virus, but neutralisation titres were always 3- to 6-fold higher against its homologous strain than heterologous virus. The cross-reactivity R value between aSG10 and LaSota was 0.23, indicating that they are loosely related with major antigenic differences within a single serotype. The results of animal tests revealed that the aSG10 vaccine had a significantly higher protection rate than the LaSota vaccine against genotype VII NDV, regardless of intramuscular (IM) or eye drop/intranasal (ED/IN) route of SG10 challenge. Compared with IM administration, chicken flocks needed higher HI antibody levels to obtain sufficient protection when challenged by the natural ED/IN route.

However, impact of co-infections is not well known, especially in broilers. The current study was aimed to assess the probable synergism of E. coli (O78) and velogenic Newcastle disease virus (vNDV-CK-Pakistan-NARC-13N39-2013), in the broiler model. Three-week-old commercial broilers were inoculated with either vNDV, E. coli serotype O78 or both agents simultaneously or 3 days apart. The birds were clinically observed and swabbed daily. They were killed at 4 and 14 days after single or dual inoculations and were inspected for gross lesions. Samples of the respiratory organs (trachea, lungs, and air sacs) were taken for histological analyses. All the infected subjects showed clinical signs of varying severity. Co-infected groups showed the most obvious clinical signs, associated with significant higher mortality and respiratory organ abnormalities, in comparison with the monoinfected groups (P<0.05). There was a non-significant (P>0.05) effect of the inoculation time intervals between vNDV and E. coli inoculation (none or 3 days). Microscopic lesions staining supported clinical and macroscopic findings. Higher virus shedding (P<0.05) in oropharyngeal swabs was observed in coinfected groups than single infected groups. The results revealed that experimental co-infection of E. coli and NDV enhances the degree of severity of clinical signs, gross lesions and death rate and warns that E. coli and NDV can cause substantial economic losses by exercising additive or synergistic pathogenic effect in the reproduction of respiratory disease if given simultaneously or three days apart.

The use of chicken interferon gamma (chIFNaγ) during vaccination is a potentially important but controversial approach that may improve the immune response to antigens. In the present study, three different systems to co-deliver chIFNaγ with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) antigens were evaluated for their ability to enhance the avian immune response and their protective capacity upon challenge with virulent NDV. These systems consisted of: 1) a DNA vaccine expressing the Newcastle disease virus fusion (F) protein co-administered with a vector expressing the chIFNaγ gene for in ovo and booster vaccination, 2) a recombinant Newcastle disease virus expressing the chIFNaγ gene (rZJ1∗L/IFNaγ) used as a live vaccine delivered in ovo and into juvenile chickens, and 3) the same rZJ1∗L/IFNaγ virus used as an inactivated vaccine for juvenile chickens. Co-administration of chIFNaγ with a DNA vaccine expressing the F protein resulted in higher levels of morbidity and mortality, and higher amounts of virulent virus shed after challenge when compared to the group that did not receive chIFNaγ. The live vaccine system co-delivering chIFNaγ did not enhanced post-vaccination antibody response, nor improved survival after hatch, when administered in ovo, and did not affect survival after challenge when administered to juvenile chickens. The low dose of the inactivated vaccine co-delivering active chIFNaγ induced lower antibody titers than the groups that did not receive the cytokine. The high dose of this vaccine did not increase the antibody titers or antigen-specific memory response, and did not reduce the amount of challenge virus shed or mortality after challenge. In summary, regardless of the delivery system, chIFNaγ,when administered simultaneously with the vaccine antigen, did not enhance Newcastle disease virus vaccine immunogenicity. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

The causative agents are virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which belong to the genus Avulavirus, sub-family Paramyxoviridae, family Paramyxovirinae. Knowing the genomic and antigenic characteristics of virulent NDVs might contribute to ND control in China. Results: The results showed that all of the virulent strains belonged sub-genotype VIId shared the same cleavage site 112RRQKR/F117 in the fusion protein. At least 69 % (38 of 55) of the NDV strains possessed E347K variation in the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein. The cross-neutralization tests confirmed that the strains harboring 347 K showed lower antigenic relatedness with LaSota. Furthermore, the immune-challenge experiment indicated that LaSota could not provide complete protection against infection with the E347K variant NDVs as the vaccinated birds were still able to be infected and shed virulent challenge viruses. Conclusions: Currently, sub-genotype VIId NDVs are the prevalent virulent strains circulating among vaccinated chicken flocks in Eastern China. Our findings indicated that the E347K variation in HN gene would expand the antigenic difference with LaSota, which may be responsible for the increasing isolation rate of these strains from vaccinated chickens. © 2016 The Author(s).",2016

Given that various wild bird species have been implicated as sources of transmission, in this study we genotypically and pathotypically characterized 23 NDV isolates collected from chickens, ducks, and pigeons in live bird markets (LBMs) in South China as part of an H7N9 surveillance program during December 2013-February 2014. To simulate the natural transmission of different kinds of animals in LBMs, we selected three representative NDVs-namely, GM, YF18, and GZ289-isolated from different birds to evaluate the pathogenicity and transmission of the indicated viruses in chickens, ducks, and pigeons. Furthermore, to investigate the replication and shedding of NDV in poultry, we inoculated the chickens, ducks, and pigeons with 106 EID50 of each virus via intraocular and intranasal routes. Eight hour after infection, the naïve contact groups were housed with those inoculated with each of the viruses as a means to monitor contact transmission. Our results indicated that genetically diverse viruses circulate in LBMs in South China's Guangdong Province and that NDV from different birds have different tissue tropisms and host ranges when transmitted in different birds. We therefore propose the continuous epidemiological surveillance of LBMs to support the prevention of the spread of these viruses in different birds, especially chickens, and highlight the need for studies of the virus-host relationship. © 2016 Kang, Xiang, Yuan, Zhao, Feng, Gao, Li, Li, Ning and Ren.",2016

Vaccination is used as a control measure, but it is unknown whether vaccination will prevent virus contamination of eggs. In this study, hens were sham-vaccinated or received one or two doses of inactivated LaSota vaccine, followed three weeks later by virulent Newcastle disease virus (NDV) challenge. Eggs were collected daily and shell, albumen and yolk were subjected to virus isolation, as were oral and cloacal swabs at 2 and 4 days post-challenge (dpc). A second experiment evaluated the distribution of the virus in the reproductive tract of non-vaccinates. All vaccinated chickens survived challenge, and the levels of virus shed from cloacal swabs were decreased significantly when compared to shams. In non-vaccinated hens, virus was detected in the ovary and all segments of the oviduct. Yolk, albumen and eggshell surface from eggs laid at day 4 and 5 post-infection by sham-vaccinated hens were positive for NDV, but eggs from LaSota vaccinated hens lacked virus in internal egg components (i.e. yolk and albumen) and had reduction in the number of positive eggshell surfaces. These results indicate virulent NDV can replicate in the reproductive tract of hens and contaminate internal components of eggs and eggshell surface, but vaccination was able to prevent internal egg contamination, reducing eggshell surface contamination, and reducing shedding from digestive and respiratory tracts in virulent NDV challenged hens. © 2016 This work was authored as part of the Contributors’ official duties as an Employees of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

To determine the capacity of different NDV strains to replicate and cause lesions in the brain, independently of their peripheral replication, 1-day-old chickens were inoculated in the subdural space with 7 NDV strains of different virulence (4 velogenic, 2 mesogenic, 1 lentogenic). Velogenic strains induced severe necrotizing and heterophilic ventriculitis and meningitis, as well as edema of the neuroparenchyma, and replicated extensively in the nervous tissue by day 2 postinfection, as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry, when all infected birds died. Clinical signs, microscopic lesions, and viral replication were delayed (days 3 and 4 postinfection) with mesogenic strains. Velogenic and mesogenic NDV strains replicated mainly in neurons, and immunolabeling was first detected in surface-oriented areas (periventricular and submeningeal), possibly as a reflection of the inoculation route. The lentogenic NDV strain did not cause death of infected birds; replication was confined to the epithelium of the ependyma and choroid plexuses; and lesions consisted of lymphoid aggregates limited to the choroid plexuses. Results show that extensive NDV replication in the brain is typical of velogenic and mesogenic, but not lentogenic, NDV strains. In addition, this study suggests that differences in the rate of NDV replication in nervous tissue, not differences in neurotropism, differentiate velogenic from mesogenic NDV strains. This study indicates that intracerebral inoculation might be used as an effective method to study the mechanisms of NDV neuropathogenesis. © 2015, The Author(s) 2015.",2016

Sequence analysis shows several amino acid residue substitutions at neutralizing epitopes on the F and HN proteins of recent Shaanxi strains. Both Cross protection and cross serum neutralization tests revealed that the traditional vaccine strains were unable to provide full protection for the flocks. Methods: To better understand the epidemiology of Newcastle disease outbreak, a portion of the F gene and the full-length HN gene were amplified from Shaanxi isolates by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and then conducted sequence and phylogenetic analyzes. In pathogenicity analysis, both high intra-cerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) and mean death time (MDT) tests of chicken embryo were carried out. Furthermore, a cross-protection experiment in which specific-pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain were challenged by the recent Shaanxi strain was also performed. Results: Nine Newcastle disease (ND) virus (NDV) isolates which were recovered from ND outbreaks in chicken flocks in China were genotypically and pathotypically characterized. Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that all the recent Shaanxi-isolated NDVs have 112R-R-Q-K-R-F117 for the C-terminus of the F2 protein and exhibit high ICPI and MDT of chicken embryos, suggesting that they were all classified as velogenic type of NDVs. Phylogenetic analysis of these isolates showed that they belong to subgenotype VIId that have been implicated in the recent outbreaks in northwestern China. The percentage of amino acid sequence identity of F protein between recent Shaanxi stains and five vaccine strains was in the range of 81.9 %-88.1 %, while the percentage of amino acid sequence identity of HN protein between recent Shaanxi strains and vaccine strains was in the range of 87.4 %-91.2 %. Furthermore, a number of amino acid residue substitutions at neutralizing epitopes on the F and HN proteins of these isolates were observed, which may lead to the change of antibody recognition and neutralization capacity. A cross-protection experiment indicated that specific-pathogen-free chickens vaccinated with a LaSota vaccine strain was not capable of providing full protection for the flocks that were challenged by the recent Shaanxi strain. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings reveal that recent Shannxi NDVstrains exhibit antigenic variations that could be responsible for recent outbreaks of NDVs in northwestern China. © 2015 Wang et al.",2015

We have developed an improved and more stringent protocol to experimentally evaluate live NDV vaccines, and showed for the first time under experimental conditions that a statistically significant reduction in mortality can be detected with genotype matched vaccines. Using both vaccine evaluation protocols (traditional and improved), birds were challenged with a vNDV of genotype XIII and the efficacy of live heterologous (genotype II) and homologous (genotype XIII) NDV vaccines was compared. Under traditional vaccination conditions there were no differences in survival upon challenge, but the homologous vaccine induced significantly higher levels of antibodies specific to the challenge virus. With the more stringent challenge system (multiple vaccine doses and early challenge with high titers of vNDV), the birds administered the homologous vaccine had superior humoral responses, reduced clinical signs, and reduced mortality levels than those vaccinated with the heterologous vaccine.

Although vaccines are widely applied to control the infection, outbreaks of Newcastle disease (ND) repeatedly happen. Currently, there are no alternative control measures available for ND. In the present study, we found that sulfated Chuanmingshen violaceum polysaccharide (sCVPS) were potent inhibitors of NDV in specific pathogen free chickens infected with a virulent strain. With sCVPS treatment, the survival rate increased by almost 20% and virus titers in test organs, including brain, lung, spleen and thymus, were significantly decreased. The sCVPS also exhibited the ability to prevent viral transmission by reducing the amount of virus shed in saliva and feces. Higher concentrations of interferon α and γ in serum were detected in chickens treated with sCVPS, indicating that one of the antiviral mechanisms may be attributed to the property of immunoenhancement. Histopathological examination showed that sCVPS could alleviate the tissue lesions caused by NDV infection. These results suggest that sCVPS are expected to be a new alternative control measure for NDV infection and further studies could be carried out to evaluate the antiviral activity of sCVPS against other paramyxoviruses. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",2015

However, in the lungs, the expression of TLR3, TLR7, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-8, IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma, and MHC II induced by SS-10 at 72 h post-inoculation (hpi) was less than with NH-10. Furthermore, the expression of IL-6 and IFN-beta in the lungs and thymuses following infection with SS-10 was greater than that with NH-10 at 24 and 48 hpi. These results highlight important differences in host innate immune responses, courses of infection, and pathogenesis following NDV infection. Further studies should work to expand understandings of the molecular mechanisms related to NDV infection. © 2015 Kang, Li, Yuan, Feng, Xiang, Sun, Li, Xie, Tan and Ren.",2015

Ducks are generally considered to be natural reservoirs or carriers of NDV while being resistant to NDV strains, even those most virulent for chickens; however, natural ND cases in ducks have been gradually increasing in recent years. In the present study, ducks of different breeds and ages were experimentally infected with duck origin virulent NDV strain duck/Jiangsu/JSD0812/2008 (JSD0812) by various routes to investigate the pathogenicity of NDV in ducks.Results: Six breeds (mallard, Gaoyou, Shaoxing, Jinding, Shanma, and Pekin ducks) were infected intramuscularly (IM) with JSD0812 strain at the dose of 5 × 108 ELD50. Susceptibility to NDV infection among breeds varied, per morbidity and mortality. Mallard ducks were the most susceptible, and Pekin ducks the most resistant. Fifteen-, 30-, 45-, 60-, and 110-day-old Gaoyou ducks were infected with JSD0812 strain at the dose of 5 × 108 ELD50 either IM or intranasally (IN) and intraocularly (IO), and their disease development, viral shedding, and virus tissue distribution were determined. The susceptibility of ducks to NDV infection decreased with age. Most deaths occurred in 15- and 30-day-old ducklings infected IM. Ducks infected IN and IO sometimes exhibited clinical signs, but seldom died. Clinical signs were primarily neurologic. Infected ducks could excrete infectious virus from the pharynx and/or cloaca for a short period, which varied with bird age or inoculation route; the longest period was about 7 days. The rate of virus isolation in tissues from infected ducks was generally low, even in those from dead birds, and it appeared to be unrelated to bird age and infection route.Conclusions: The results confirmed that some of the naturally occurring NDV virulent strains can cause the disease in ducks, and that ducks play an important role in the epidemiology of ND. The prevention of NDV spread in ducks should receive more attention and research in terms of preventing the occurrence and prevalence of ND. © 2014 Dai et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014

The clinical signs, gross lesions, and histopathological changes were observed in pigeons inoculated with pi/CH/LHLJ/110822. The morbidity and mortality rates were 80% and 70% in pigeons, respectively, whereas there were no clinical signs or gross lesions in chickens inoculated with the same strain. The viral loads in tissue samples were detected by real-time RT-PCR, indicating that six tissue samples (i.e., kidney, lung, brain, trachea, Harderian glands, and proventriculus) had detectable viral RNA in all dead pigeons, and significant differences in viral loads between pigeons and chickens were observed in several tissue samples (i.e., Harderian glands, proventriculus, duodenum, pancreas, small intestine, and large intestine) on 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) and in brain tissue on 7 dpi. In general, viral loads in pigeons were higher than those in chickens, whereas antibody titers in pigeons were lower than those in chickens. These results showed differences in pathogenicity, efficiency of viral RNA replication, and humoral immunity, indicating different susceptibilities between the host species. Additionally, the cross hemagglutination inhibition assay and cross virus neutralization tests demonstrated that pi/CH/LHLJ/110822 antigenicity was different from those of strains La Sota and F48E9. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014

Thus, a chimeric APMV-1 based vaccine that encodes APMV-8 HN- and F-proteins and expresses the hemagglutinin of avian influenza virus (AIV) H5N1, is able to protect against HPAIV H5N1 but fails to protect against NDV [PLoS One 8:e72530, 2013]. However, it is unclear whether avirulent APMV-subtypes, like APMV-8 can induce subtype-specific immunity and protect from a homologous challenge. Findings: APMV-8 infections of 3- and 6-weeks-old specific pathogen free (SPF)-chickens did not induce any clinical signs but was associated with virus shedding for up to 6 days. Viral replication was only detected in oropharyngeal- and never in cloacal swabs. Upon reinfection with homologous APMV-8, viral shedding was restricted to day 2 and in contrast to naive SPF-chickens, only RNA but no infectious virus was recovered. No protection was induced against virulent NDV challenge, although morbidity and mortality was delayed in APMV-8 primed chickens. This lack of protection is in line with a lack of reactivity of APMV-8 specific sera to APMV-1 HN-protein: Neither by hemagglutin-inhibition (HI) test nor immunoblot analyses, cross-reactivity was detected, despite reactivity to internal proteins. Conclusions: Immune responses mounted during asymptomatic APMV-8 infection limit secondary infection against homologues reinfection and facilitates a delay in the onset of disease in a subtype independent manner but is unable to protect against Newcastle disease, a heterologous APMV-subtype. © 2014 Grund et al.",2014

The emergence of virulent NDV genotypes and repeated outbreaks of NDV in vaccinated chickens have raised the need for fundamental studies on the virus-host interactions. In this study, the profiles of B and T lymphocytes and macrophages and differential expression of 26 immune-related genes in the spleen of specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, infected with either the velogenic genotype VII NDV strain IBS002 or the genotype VIII NDV strain AF2240, were evaluated. A significant reduction in T lymphocyte population and an increase in the infiltration of IgM+ B cells and KUL01+ macrophages were detected in the infected spleens at 1, 3 and 4 days post-infection (dpi) (P&lt;0.05). The gene expression profiles showed an up-regulation of CCLi3, CXCLi1, CXCLi2 (IL-8), IFN-γ, IL-12α, IL-18, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, TLR7, MHCI, IL-17F and TNFSF13B (P&lt;0.05). However, these two genotypes showed different cytokine expression patterns and viral load. IBS002 showed higher viral load than AF2240 in spleen at 3 and 4dpi and caused a more rapid up-regulation of CXCLi2, IFN-γ, IL-12α, IL-18, IL-1β, iNOS and IL-10 at 3dpi. Meanwhile, the expression levels of CCLI3, CXCLi1, IFN-γ, IL-12α, IL-1β and iNOS genes were significantly higher in AF2240 at 4dpi. In addition, the expression levels of IL-10 were significantly higher in the IBS002-infected chickens at 3 and 4dpi. Hence, infection with velogenic genotype VII and VIII NDV induced different viral load and production of cytokines and chemokines associated with inflammatory reactions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2014

Chickens were vaccinated with Hitchner B1, La Sota or I-2 via the intraocular and intranasal routes. Vaccine and challenge viruses induced high antibody levels, both in inoculated and contact birds. Prime-boost vaccination protected birds against morbidity and mortality and significantly reduced the incidence of viral shedding from chickens compared with single vaccinated and unvaccinated birds. Protection from disease and mortality was correlated with the presence of positive antibody titres (&gt;4 log2) at day of challenge. Most of the unvaccinated and in-contact birds excreted the virus and showed a high level of antibody titres, indicating the high infectivity of the challenge virus. The detection of the challenge virus in most of vaccinated birds demonstrated that the tested vaccination protocols cannot fully protect birds from viral infection, replication and shedding, and vaccinated–infected birds can act as a source of infection for susceptible flocks. The high mortality observed in unvaccinated birds and their contacts confirmed the virulence of the challenge virus and indicated that this field virus strain can easily spread in an unvaccinated poultry population and cause major outbreaks. Progressive vaccinations supported by biosecurity measures should therefore be implemented to control the disease and introduction of the virus to the poultry farms. © 2014 Houghton Trust Ltd.",2014

Specific-pathogen-free chickens were immunized with oil emulsion NDV VLP vaccines containing increasing dosages of VLPs (0.4, 2, 10, or 50μg of VLPs/0.5-ml dose). Three weeks after immunization, the immunogenicity of the NDV VLP vaccines was determined using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit, and a lethal challenge using a highly virulent NDV strain was performed to evaluate the protective efficacy of the NDV VLP vaccines. NDV VLP vaccines elicited anti-NDV antibodies and provided protection against a lethal challenge in a dose-dependent manner. Although the VLP vaccines containing 0.4 and 2 μg of VLPs failed to achieve high levels of protection, a single immunization with NDV VLP vaccine containing 10 or 50μg could fully protect chickens from a lethal challenge and greatly reduced challenge virus shedding. Furthermore, we could easily differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) using the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test.

Traditionally, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is recognized as having two major divisions represented by classes I and II, with class II being further divided into sixteen genotypes. Although all NDV are members of APMV-1 and are of one serotype, antigenic and genetic diversity is observed between the different genotypes. Reports of vaccine failure from many countries and reports by our lab on the reduced ability of classical vaccines to significantly decrease viral replication and shedding have created renewed interest in developing vaccines formulated with genotypes homologous to the virulent NDV (vNDV) circulating in the field. We assessed how the amount and specificity of humoral antibodies induced by inactivated vaccines affected viral replication, clinical protection and evaluated how non-homologous (heterologous) antibody levels induced by live NDV vaccines relate to transmission of vNDV. In an experimental setting, all inactivated NDV vaccines protected birds from morbidity and mortality, but higher and more specific levels of antibodies were required to significantly decrease viral replication. It was possible to significantly decrease viral replication and shedding with high levels of antibodies and those levels could be more easily reached with vaccines formulated with NDV of the same genotype as the challenge viruses. However, when the levels of heterologous antibodies were sufficiently high, it was possible to prevent transmission. As the level of humoral antibodies increase in vaccinated birds, the number of infected birds and the amount of vNDV shed decreased. Thus, in an experimental setting the effective levels of humoral antibodies could be increased by (1) increasing the homology of the vaccine to the challenge virus, or (2) allowing optimal time for the development of the immune response. © 2013.",2013

The current control measure is vaccination, but infections cannot be completely prevented. It remains a constant threat to the poultry industry and new control measures are urgently needed. This study demonstrates that sulfated Chuanmingshen violaceum polysaccharides (sCVPSs) were potent inhibitors of NDV, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) ranging from 62.55 to 76.31 mg ml-1 in Baby hamster kidney fibroblasts clone 21 (BHK-21) and from 101.57 to 125.90 mg ml-1 in chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF). sCVPS is more effective than heparan sulfate (HS; as a positive control) with IC50 values of 99.28 mg ml-1 in BHK-21 and 118.79 mg ml-1 in CEF. sCVPSs and HS exhibit anti-NDV activity by prevention of the early stages of viral life. The mechanism of action study indicated that virus adsorption in BHK-21, and both virus adsorption and penetration in CEF were inhibited by sCVPSs. When the number of viruses was increased to an m.o.i. of 0.1 in the immunofluorescence study and to an m.o.i. of 1 in the fluorescent quantitative PCR study, viral infection was also significantly suppressed; the antiviral activity of sCVPSs was independent of the m.o.i. sCVPSs also prevented the cell-to-cell spread of NDV. In vivo tests carried out on specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens showed that sCVPSs also inhibited virus multiplication in heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney. These results indicated that sCVPSs perform more effectively than HS as antiviral agents against NDV, and can be further examined for their potential as an alternative control measure for NDV infection. © 2013 SGM.",2013

These vaccination schemes did not induce detectable levels of serum antibodies in HI test using a clade 2.2.1 H5N1 antigen, and only induced H5 ELISA positive response in less than 10% of vaccinated ducks. However, following challenge against a clade 2.2.1 HPAIV, both protocols afforded full clinical protection at six weeks of age, and full protection against mortality at nine weeks. Only the prime-boost vaccination (vFP89. +. vNDV-H5) was still fully protecting Muscovy ducks against disease and mortality at 12 weeks of age. Reduction of oropharyngeal shedding levels was also constantly observed from the onset of the follow-up at 2.5 or three days post-infection in vaccinated ducks compared to unvaccinated controls, and was significantly more important for vFP89. +. vNDV-H5 vaccination than for vNDV-H5 alone. Although the latter vaccine is shown immunogenic in one-day old Muscovy ducks, the present work is original in demonstrating the high efficacy of the successive administration of two different vector vaccines encoding two different H5 in inducing lasting protection (at least similar to the one induced by an inactivated reassortant vaccine, Re-5). In addition, such a prime-boost schedule allows implementation of a DIVA strategy (to differentiate vaccinated from infected ducks) contrary to Re-5, involves easy practice on the field (with injection at the hatchery and mass vaccination later on), and should avoid eventual interference with NDV maternally derived antibodies.

Ducklings were experimentally infected with seven NDV strains, and their clinical sign, weight gain, antibody response, virus shedding, and virus distribution in tissues were investigated. The duck origin virulent strain duck/Jiangsu/JSD0812/2008 (JSD0812) and the Chinese standard virulent strain F48E8 were highly pathogenic for ducklings. They caused high morbidity and mortality, and they distributed extensively in various tissues of infected ducklings. Other strains, including pigeon origin virulent strain pigeon/Jiangsu/JSP0204/2002 (JSP0204), chicken origin virulent strain chicken/Jiangsu/JSC0804/2008 (JSC0804), goose origin virulent goose/Jiangsu/JSG0210/2002 (JSG0210), and vaccine strains Mukteswar and LaSota had no pathogenicity to ducklings. They produced neither clinical signs of the disease nor adverse effect on growth of infected ducklings, and they persisted in duck bodies for only a short period. Virus shedding was detectable in all infected ducklings, but its period and route varied with the virulence of NDV strains.

The complete genome of this isolate, chicken/DominicanRepublic(JuanLopez)/499-31/2008 (NDV-DR499-31/08), and the fusion proteins of three other related viruses from the Dominican Republic and Mexico were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Genetically, these four isolates were highly distinct from all other currently known isolates of NDV, and together, they fulfill the newly established criteria for inclusion as a novel genotype of NDV (genotype XVI). The lack of any reported isolation of viruses related to this group since 1986 suggests that virulent viruses of this genotype may have evolved unnoticed for 22 years. The NDV-DR499-31/08 isolate had an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) score of 1.88, and sequencing of the fusion cleavage site identified multiple basic amino acids and a phenylalanine at position 117, indicating this isolate to be virulent. These results were further confirmed by a clinicopathological assessment in vivo. In 4-week-old chickens, NDV-DR499-31/08 behaved as a velogenic viscerotropic strain with systemic virus distribution and severe necrohemorrhagic lesions targeting mainly the intestine and the lymphoid organs. The clear phylogenetic relationship between the 2008, 1986, and 1947 ancestral viruses suggests that virulent NDV strains may have evolved in unknown reservoirs in the Caribbean and surrounding regions and underlines the importance of continued and improved epidemiological surveillance strategies to detect NDV in wild-bird species and commercial poultry.

However, ND outbreaks have been frequently reported in goose flocks in China since the late 1990s with the concurrent emergence of genotype VIId NDV in chickens. Although the NDVs isolated from both chickens and geese in the past 15years have been predominantly VIId viruses, published data comparing goose- and chicken-originated ND viruses are scarce and controversial. Results: In this paper, we compared genotype VIId NDVs originated from geese and chickens genetically and pathologically. Ten entire genomic sequences and 329 complete coding sequences of individual genes from genotype VIId NDVs of both goose- and chicken-origin were analyzed. We then randomly selected two goose-originated and two chicken-originated VIId NDVs and compared their pathobiology in both geese and chickens in vivo and in vitro with genotype IV virus Herts/33 as a reference. The results showed that all the VIId NDVs either from geese or from chickens shared high sequence homology and characteristic amino acid substitutions and clustered together in phylogenetic trees. In addition, geese and chickens infected by goose or chicken VIId viruses manifested very similar pathological features distinct from those of birds infected with Herts/33. Conclusions: There is no genetic or phenotypic difference between genotype VIId NDVs originated from geese and chickens. Therefore, no species-preference exists for either goose or chicken viruses and more attention should be paid to the trans-species transmission of VIId NDVs between geese and chickens for the control and eradication of ND. © 2012 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2012

Peripheral blood serves as an important producer and carrier of viruses and cytokines in NDV infection. In order to explore the difference of cytokine expression in the peripheral blood between velogenic strain and lentogenic strain infection, NDV virulent strain F48E9 and vaccine strain Lasota were used to infect specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens separately, and peripheral blood was collected on 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 21 days post-infection (d.p.i.). Real-time PCR was then used to detect the expression of six kinds of immune-related cytokine genes. For the F48E9 group, a sharp increase of the expression of interferonalpha (IFN-α), interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin-16 and IL-18 was observed on 3 d.p.i. before the NDV blood peak (7 d.p.i.), followed by a rapid decline to the level lower than that of control group, then the expression of IFN-α increased slowly and reached or exceeded the level of control group in the later phase of the infection, while the expression of IFN-c, IL-16, and IL-18 fluctuated at the level of control group for the rest of study period. The increase of IL-2 expression was not obvious, and no increase of IL-15 expression was noted. For the Lasota (vaccine) group, the picture was quite different, a sharp increase of IFN-c (but not IFN-α), IL-2 was observed on 7 d.p.i. before the NDV blood peak (10 d.p.i.). On the contrary, there was no dramatic increase of IL-16 and IL-18. Interestingly, in contrast to the F48E9 group, there was an increase of IL-15 on day 10 d.p.i., but it remained modest. There was also an increase of IFN-α on day 21 d.p.i.

The APMVs are classified into nine serotypes on the basis of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NI) assays, although some serologic cross-reaction exists. Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which constitutes serotype 1 (APMV-1), is an important pathogen of poultry, but the pathogenic potential of the other APMV serotypes is poorly understood. Although antibodies to APMV -2 to -9 are prevalent in chickens, the effect of prior exposure to these serotypes on susceptibility to NDV infection and disease was not known. In the present study, chickens were immunized with APMV-2 to -9 by the oculo-nasal route and later were challenged by the same route with a highly virulent strain of NDV. Among APMV-2 to -9, only APMV-3 induced serum antibodies that cross-reacted significantly with NDV and had significant NDV-neutralizing activity in vitro. In mock-immunized chickens, challenge NDV replicated throughout the respiratory tract as well as in the brain, spleen, and enteric tract. In contrast, in APMV-3-immunized chickens, challenge NDV replication was restricted to the upper respiratory tract and trachea. Some of the other APMVs also induced partial restriction of challenge NDV replication: for example, challenge NDV was not detected in the brains of APMV-9-immunized chickens, and shedding from the respiratory tract was reduced in chickens immunized with APMV-8 and -9. All of the chickens immunized with APMV-3 survived the NDV challenge; with APMV-2, -7, -8, and -9 the percentage survival was 30%, 20%, 20%, and 52.5%, respectively; whereas none of the chickens immunized with APMV-4, -5, or -6 survived. These results show that prior infection of chickens with APMV-3 induced substantial protection against NDV challenge, whereas prior infection with APMV-2, -7, -8, and -9 can alter subsequent NDV infection. The induction of NDV-neutralizing antibodies was a marker for efficient protection, but partial protection also was observed in their absence. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",2012

The disease is caused by Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1), a negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus of the genus Avulavirus, family Paramyxoviridae. Although all NDV isolates characterized to date belong to a single serotype of APMV-1, significant genetic diversity has been described between different NDV isolates. Here we present the complete genome sequence and the clinicopathological characterization of a virulent Newcastle disease virus isolate (NDV-Peru/08) obtained from poultry during an outbreak of ND in Peru in 2008. Phylogenetic reconstruction and analysis of the evolutionary distances between NDV-Peru/08 and other isolates representing established NDV genotypes revealed the existence of large genomic and amino differences that clearly distinguish this isolate from viruses of typical NDV genotypes. Although NDV-Peru/ 08 is a genetically distinct virus, pathogenesis studies conducted with chickens revealed that NDV-Peru/08 infection results in clinical signs characteristic of velogenic viscerotropic NDV strains. Additionally, vaccination studies have shown that an inactivated NDV-LaSota/46 vaccine conferred full protection from NDV-Peru/08-induced clinical disease and mortality.

The study used Specific-Pathogen-Free chicks (SPF) that were housed with lovebirds inoculated with a pathogenic strain (velogenic viscerotropic) of NDV pathogenic to chickens, by the ocular-nasal via. Each group was composed of six SPF chicks and four lovebirds. After five days of the inoculation of the lovebirds with NDV, SPF chicks were put together with each group of lovebirds. Cloacae swabs were collected after 9, 14 and 21 days post-challenge in both species (lovebirds and SPF chicks) for genome viral excretion by Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Lovebirds did not demonstrate any clinical signs of NDV. They were refractory to the clinical disease with the NDV. However, NDV genome was detected 9 and 21 days after challenge. This study shows that lovebirds can be carriers NDV. Moreover, 100% of SPF chicks allocated with the infected lovebirds demonstrated clinical signs and lesions suggestive of NDV. In these birds, NDV genome was detected 9, 14 and 21 days after challenge. Thus, the transmission of the pathogenic virus from the lovebirds to SPF chicks that were housed together was evident until 21 days of the experimental infection.

There is limited knowledge about the avian immune response to infection with virulent NDVs, and how this response may contribute to disease. In this study, pathogenesis and the transcriptional host response of chickens to a virulent NDV strain that rapidly causes 100% mortality was characterized. Using microarrays, a strong transcriptional host response was observed in spleens at early times after infection with the induction of groups of genes involved in innate antiviral and pro-inflammatory responses. There were multiple genes induced at 48 h post-infection including: type I and II interferons (IFNs), several cytokines and chemokines, IFN effectors and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The increased transcription of nitric oxide synthase was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for iNOS in spleens and measured levels of nitric oxide in serum. In vitro experiments showed strong induction of the key host response genes, alpha IFN, beta interferon, and interleukin 1b and interleukin 6, in splenic leukocytes at 6 h post-infection in comparison to a non-virulent NDV. The robust host response to virulent NDV, in conjunction with severe pathological damage observed, is somewhat surprising considering that all NDV encode a gene, V, which functions as a suppressor of class I IFNs. Taken together, these results suggest that the host response itself may contribute to the pathogenesis of this highly virulent strain in chickens. © 2011 SGM.",2011

After inoculation by the combined intraocular, intranasal and intratracheal route, clinical signs, virus shedding and serological responses were examined. Clinical signs were observed only in the FL-Herts-infected group. All virus-inoculated pigeons had positive tracheal swabs until 5 days post infection. However, only the AV324/96-infected and rgAV324-infected birds, and not the FL-Herts-infected birds, shed virus in the cloaca. The AV324/96-infected pigeons showed higher mean antibody titres than the rgAV324-infected birds, whereas the antibody titres of the FL-Herts-infected group were rather low. The results show that the pigeon strain AV324 is not virulent for pigeons, but underlines the potential risk of poultry becoming infected by PPMV-1 shed by non-symptomatic pigeons. © 2011 Houghton Trust Ltd.",2011

The virus is rapidly evolving, and several new genotypes have been discovered in the past few years. Characterization of these strains is important to evaluate field changes, anticipate new outbreaks, and develop adequate control measures. Three Newcastle disease isolates (APMV-1/duck/Vietnam, Long Bien/78/2002, APMV-1/chicken/ Australia/9809-19-1107/1998, and APMV-1/double-crested cormorant/USA, Nevada/19529-04/2005) from recent outbreaks were investigated via clinicopathological assessment, immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization, virus isolation, and serology in experimentally infected 4-week-old chickens. Phylogenetic studies showed that Australia isolate belongs to class II genotype I, Long Bien to class II genotype VIId, and Nevada cormorant to class II genotype V. Even though all 3 viruses had a virulent fusion protein cleavage site and ICPI values greater than 1.5, they all differed in their ability to cause clinical signs, in their lesions, and in their viral distribution in body tissues. The Long Bien isolate showed the most severe clinicopathological picture and the most widespread viral distribution. The Australia and Nevada cormorant isolates had a milder pathological phenotype, with viral replication restricted to only a few organs. The variability in clinicopathological characteristics despite the similarity in ICPI suggests that full clinicopathological assessment is necessary to fully characterize new isolates and that there are differences in pathogenesis among viruses of different genotypes. © The American College of Veterinary Pathologists 2011.",2011

The velogenic strains were detected only by using velogenic-specific primers with a threshold cycle (Ct) 18.19 ± 3.63 and a melting temperature (Tm) 86.0 ± 0.28 °C. All the lentogenic/vaccine strains, in contrast, were detected only when lentogenic-specific primers were used, with the Ct value 14.70 ± 2.32 and Tm 87.4 ± 0.21 °C. The assay had a dynamic detection range which spans over a 5 log10 concentration range, 109-105 copies of DNA plasmid/reaction. The velogenic and lentogenic amplifications showed high PCR efficiency of 100% and 104%, respectively. The velogenic and lentogenic amplifications were highly reproducible with assay variability 0.45 ± 0.31% and 1.30 ± 0.65%, respectively. The SYBR Green I real-time PCR assay detected successfully the virus from tissue samples and oral swabs collected from the velogenic and lentogenic NDV experimental infection, respectively. In addition, the assay detected and differentiated accurately NDV pathotypes from suspected field samples where the results were in good agreement with both virus isolation and analysis of the fusion (F) cleavage site sequence.

Recent work has demonstrated that NDV vaccines phylogenetically closer to epidemic viruses provide better protection than conventional vaccines in terms of reducing virus shedding and transmission. Since there is currently no available vaccine which possesses a close antigenic relationship to the prevalent virulent NDV, a new vaccine to protect against the infection of this genotype NDV is in urgent need. Here, we describe the generation of a pathogenicity-attenuated genotype VII NDV (NDV/ZJ1HN) from a velogenic NDV by mutating the velogenic amino acid motif at the F protein cleavage site using reverse genetics techniques. The attenuated-pathogenicity of NDV/ZJ1HN was confirmed by examination of mean death time (MDT) in embryonated eggs and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in day-old chickens. Subsequently, 2 weeks old birds were immunized with live and inactivated NDV/ZJ1HN-based vaccines and challenged 3 or 4 weeks post-immunization with a lethal dose of a virulent genotype VII NDV strain. Results showed that NDV/ZJ1HN effectively protected the vaccinated birds from morbidity and mortality against genotype VII virus challenge and significantly reduced virus shedding from the vaccinated birds when compared with La Sota vaccinated animals, suggesting that NDV/ZJ1HN is a promising vaccine candidate for the control of current ND epidemic in China. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

If the minimum amount of inactivated viral antigen required for clinical protection can be determined using other methods, vaccines meeting these criteria might be considered of adequate potency. The linearity of correlation between the hemagglutination (HA) assay measurement and the 50% embryo infectious dose titer of NDV Hitchner B1 vaccine virus was determined. Correlation between hemagglutinin units (HAU) per vaccine dose, clinical protection, and antibody response was then determined using a vaccinate-and-challenge model similar to Chapter 9 of the U.S. code of federal regulations approved method for vaccine potency testing. The dose providing 50% protection of an in-house water-in-oil emulsion vaccine formulated with inactivated NDV B1 was determined to be between 400 and 600 HAU from two separate trials.

Furthermore, the high infectivity of the virus was confirmed, as all non-inoculated sentinel pigeons showed antibody levels as high as those of inoculated birds. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, the available doses of inactivated AI vaccine are limited to national vaccine banks and inventory stocks of some commercial biologics manufacturers. To determine if the available vaccine doses could be stretched by using reduced vaccine dose but maintain adequate efficacy, a study was conducted to determine if 3-wk-old specific pathogen-free White Leghorn chickens vaccinated with full, 1/2, 1/4, and 1/10 doses of an inactivated H5N9 AI vaccine would be protected against a high-dose challenge of H5N1 highly pathogenic AI virus given 4 wk later. At all 4 AI vaccine doses, the AI-vaccinated chickens were protected from disease and death, but all the sham-vaccinated chickens developed clinical signs and died. There were no differences between the full, 1/2, and 1/4 dose AI vaccine groups for serological titers at 7 wk of age, or for cloacal and oropharyngeal titers of challenge virus shed at 2 d postchallenge. However, the 1/10 dose group had significantly reduced hemagglutination inhibition titers at 7 wk compared with 1/4 dose, and the 1/10 dose group had more chickens shedding challenge virus from the oropharynx than the full dose group. Most importantly, the mean protective dose was 1/50 dose, and using the international regulatory standard of 50 mean protective doses for Newcastle disease vaccine as a guide, the full dose of the H5N9 AI vaccine would be the minimum dose acceptable for use in the field. Use of the full vaccine dose is especially important, because protection in commercial chickens in the field is typically less than seen in experimental studies in specific pathogen-free chickens in the laboratory. ©2008 Poultry Science Association, Inc.",2008

It is widely recognized that an efficacious Newcastle disease (ND) vaccine made with any NDV does induce protection against morbidity and mortality from a virulent NDV challenge. However, those ND vaccines do not protect vaccinates from infection and viral shed from such a challenge. Vaccines prepared from ND viruses corresponding to five different genotypes were compared to determine if the phylogenetic distance between vaccine and challenge strain influences the protection induced and the amount of challenge virus shed. Six groups of 4-week-old specific pathogen-free Leghorn chickens were given oil-adjuvanted vaccines prepared from one of five different inactivated ND viruses including strains B1, Ulster, CA02, Pigeon84, Alaska196, or an allantoic fluid control. Three weeks post-vaccination, serum was analyzed for antibody content using a hemagglutination inhibition assay against each of the vaccine antigens and a commercial NDV ELISA. After challenge with virulent CA02, the birds were examined daily for morbidity and mortality and were monitored at selected intervals for virus shedding. All vaccines except for the control induced greater than 90% protection to clinical disease and mortality. The vaccine homologous with the challenge virus reduced oral shedding significantly more than the heterologous vaccines. NDV vaccines formulated to be phylogenetically closer to potential outbreak viruses may provide better ND control by reducing virus transmission from infected birds.",2007

Adjuvants for DNA vaccines can influence the balance between humoral and cell-mediated immunities. In this study, a DNA vaccine encoding the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase and fusion genes of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) incorporated with chicken interferon-γ (provax-chIFN-γ) cDNA as a molecular adjuvant and levamisole (LMS) as a chemical adjuvant was tested for its efficacy in protection against NDV lethal challenge. Compared with DNA vaccine alone, the DNA vaccine with provax-chIFN-γ plus LMS induced significantly higher humoral and cell-mediated responses, as shown by higher levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers and T cell proliferation. In addition, the DNA vaccine with provax-chIFN-γ plus LMS formulation increased the expression of IFN-γ, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-12, and IL-13, suggesting that the effectiveness of the IFN-γ and LMS formulation is partly due to the enhancement of balanced cytokine production. Furthermore, the two adjuvants yielded 80% protection in chickens against challenge with a lethal dose of the virulent NDV strain.

A cloned full-length copy of the genome of the lentogenic NDV strain Clone 30 was used for insertion of the ORF encoding the HA of the highly pathogenic AIV isolate A/chicken/Italy/8/98 (H5N2) in the intergenic region between the NDV fusion and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) genes. Remarkably, two species of HA transcripts were detected in cells infected with the resultant NDVH5. In a second recombinant (NDVH5m), a NDV transcription termination signal-like sequence located within the HA ORF was eliminated by silent mutations. Consequently, NDVH5m produced 2.7-fold more full-length HA transcripts, expressed higher levels of HA, and also incorporated more HA protein into its envelope than NDVH5. NDVH5m stably expressed the modified HA gene for 10 egg passages and both recombinants were found innocuous after intracerebral inoculation of 1-day-old chickens. Immunization of chickens with NDVH5m induced NDV- and AIVH5-specific antibodies and protected chickens against clinical disease after challenge with a lethal dose of velogenic NDV or highly pathogenic AIV, respectively. Remarkably, shedding of influenza virus was not observed. Furthermore, immunization with NDVH5m permitted serological discrimination of vaccinated and AIV field virus-infected animals based on antibodies against the nucleoprotein of AIV. Therefore, recombinant NDVH5m is suitable as a bivalent vaccine against NDV and AIV and may be used as marker vaccine for the control of avian influenza. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",2006

The outbreak raised concerns regarding the protective immunity of commercially available vaccines for prevention and control of this virus in poultry. We sought to determine if existing commercial live and inactivated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccines could provide protection against the 2002-2003 END virus, and whether current commercial NDV-vaccination programs for broiler-breeders (BB) and broilers (Br) would protect against END-challenge. In the first experiment, birds received a single dose of either inactivated or live B1-type vaccine at 2 weeks-of-age and were challenged 2 weeks post-vaccination with a lethal dose of END. In the second experiment, a high (106.9 EID50/bird) or low (103.9 EID 50/bird) dose of live B1 was applied to 8-week-old chickens, followed by lethal END challenge. In the third experiment, NDV field-vaccinated commercial BB (65 weeks-of-age) and Br (36 days-of-age) were challenged against END virus. Results indicated that both the live and inactivated vaccines protected against morbidity and mortality and significantly reduced the incidence and viral titers shed from chickens in comparison with sham controls, but did not prevent infection and virus shedding. In addition, both doses of live vaccine protected birds and significantly decreased the number of birds shedding virus. All unvaccinated control chickens challenged with END died within 6 days post-challenge (pc). Protection from disease correlated with the presence of antibody titers (determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or hemagglutination inhibition (HI)) at day of challenge. Commercial BB were protected from disease and exhibited low incidence and titer of challenge virus shed. In contrast, commercial Br exhibited 66% mortality and shed significantly more virus than the BB birds. These results underscore the need to develop new NDV vaccines and vaccine strategies for use during outbreak situations to protect birds from both disease and infection to reduce virus shedding. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

PCR analysis showed that in ovo vaccination with rHVT resulted in a persistent infection leading to systemic immunity against ND for up to 8 weeks of age, the longest period of time tested in this study. However, virus isolation tests indicated that rHVT-vaccinated chickens were only partially protected from the replication of NDV-GB-TX in the trachea.

RVFV induces severe disease in newborns and abortion in pregnant ruminants. The viral genome consists of a small (S), medium (M) and large (L) RNA segment of negative polarity. The M segment encodes a glycoprotein precursor protein that is co-translationally cleaved into the two structural glycoproteins Gn and Gc, which are involved in receptor attachment and cell entry. We previously constructed a four-segmented RVFV (RVFV-4s) by splitting the M genome segment into two M-type segments encoding either Gn or Gc. RVFV-4s replicates efficiently in cell culture but was shown to be completely avirulent in mice, lambs and pregnant ewes. Here, we show that a RVFV-4s candidate vaccine for veterinary use (vRVFV-4s) does not disseminate in vaccinated animals, is not shed or spread to the environment and does not revert to virulence. Furthermore, a single vaccination of lambs, goat kids and calves was shown to induce protective immunity against a homologous challenge. Finally, the vaccine was shown to provide full protection against a genetically distinct RVFV strain. Altogether, we demonstrate that vRVFV-4s optimally combines efficacy with safety, holding great promise as a next-generation RVF vaccine. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020

There is currently an ongoing effort to produce safe and efficacious veterinary vaccines against RVFV in livestock to protect against both primary infection in animals and zoonotic infections in people. To test the efficacy of these vaccines, it is essential to have a reliable challenge model in relevant target species, including ruminants. We evaluated two goat breeds (Nubian and LaMancha), three routes of inoculation (intranasal, mosquito-primed subcutaneous, and subcutaneous) using an infectious dose of 10 7 pfu/mL, a virus strain from the 2006–2007 Kenyan/Sudan outbreak and compared the effect of using virus stocks produced in either mammalian or mosquito cells. Our results demonstrated that the highest and longest viremia titers were achieved in Nubian goats. The Nubian breed was also efficient at producing clinical signs, consistent viremia (peak viremia: 1.2 × 10 3 –1.0 × 10 5 pfu/mL serum), nasal and oral shedding of viral RNA (1.5 × 10 1 –8 × 10 6 genome copies/swab), a systemic infection of tissues, and robust antibody responses regardless of the inoculation route. The Nubian goat breed and a needle-free intranasal inoculation technique could both be utilized in future vaccine and challenge studies.

Due to the high probability of new outbreaks and spread to other continents where competent vectors are present, vaccine development is an urgent priority as no licensed vaccines are available outside areas of endemicity. In this study, we evaluated in sheep the protective immunity induced by DNA vaccines encoding the extracellular portion of the Gn antigen which was either or not targeted to antigen-presenting cells. The DNA encoding untargeted antigen was the most potent at inducing IgG responses, although not neutralizing, and conferred a significant clinical and virological protection upon infectious challenge, superior to DNA vaccines encoding the targeted antigen. A statistical analysis of the challenge parameters supported that the anti-eGn IgG, rather than the T-cell response, was instrumental in protection. Altogether, this work shows that a DNA vaccine encoding the extracellular portion of the Gn antigen confers substantial-although incomplete-protective immunity in sheep, a natural host with high preclinical relevance, and provides some insights into key immune correlates useful for further vaccine improvements against the Rift Valley fever virus. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018

Adult sheep of both sexes were challenged 12 weeks after the last immunization and clinical, virological, biochemical and immunological consequences, were analyzed. Strategies based on immunization with homologous DNA or heterologous DNA/MVA prime-boost were able to induce a rapid in vitro neutralizing antibody response as well as IFNγ production after in vitro virus specific re-stimulation. In these animals we observed reduced viremia levels and less clinical signs when compared with mock-immunized controls. In contrast, sheep inoculated with a homologous MVA prime-boost showed increased viremia correlating with the absence of detectable neutralizing antibody responses, despite of inducing cellular responses after the last immunization. However, faster induction of neutralizing antibodies and IFNγ production after challenge were found in this group when compared to the mock vaccinated group, indicative of a primed immune response. In conclusion, these results suggest that vaccination strategies based on DNA priming were able to mount and maintain specific anti-RVFV glycoprotein immune responses upon homologous or heterologous booster doses, warranting further optimization in large animal models of infection. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018

Because of the complexity of the PPR epizootic situation in neighboring countries (Tajikistan, China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan) the risk of occurrence of this disease on the territories of Siberian, Ural, Far Eastern, North Caucasian and Southern Federal Districts of Russian Federation is very high. So, the development of molecular-genetic methods for the diagnosis of PPR and methods for stabilizing of biological samples represents scientific relevance. This article presents data on the development of a test system for detecting the PPR virus genome by reverse transcription Real-Time PCR. This technique is based on the amplification of a fragment (148 bp) of hemagglutinin gene of PPR virus using the original oligonucleotide primers and fluorescent-labeled hybridization probe. Analytical specificity of the developed test system was evaluated by testing the strains of PPR virus, rinderpest virus, bluetongue virus, as well as biological samples from clinically healthy animals and intact cell cultures. Positive results were obtained only with samples containing PPR virus (strains Epizootichesky, Nigeria 75/1 and 45G37/35-K). The analytical sensitivity of the developed test-system, determined using tenfold serial dilutions of cultural virus-containing material, is 0.83±0.22 lg TCID50/ml. To create a positive amplification control, a fragment of hemagglutinin gene synthesized usign Real-Time PCR was cloned in plasmid pTZ57 R/T in Escherichia coli. It was established that the plasmid DNA concentration for amplification linearity ranges from 2.4½107 to 24 molecules/μl. To assess the practical suitability of the developed test system for the diagnosis of PPR, the blood samples from sheep experimentally infected with PPR virus (strain Epizootichesky) were tested. As a result, the PPR virus genome was detected in blood samples from day 5 to day 12 after infection. Since transportation of biological samples over long distances may require during survey, we have developed “dry” blood method to collect and store blood samples. It has been shown that “dry” blood drops are stable at room temperature for a month and can be used in Real-Time PCR testing. © 2019 Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

The capsule polysaccharide (CPS) of Mmm is one of the few identified virulence determinants. In a previous study, immunization of mice against CPS generated antibodies, but they were not able to prevent multiplication of Mmm in this model animal. However, mice cannot be considered as a suitable animal model, as Mmm does not induce pathology in this species. Our aim was to induce antibody responses to CPS in cattle, and challenge them when they had specific CPS antibody titres similar or higher than those from cattle vaccinated with the live vaccine. The CPS was linked to the carrier protein ovalbumin via a carbodiimide-mediated condensation with 1-ethyl-3(3-imethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC). Ten animals were immunized twice and challenged three weeks after the booster inoculation, and compared to a group of challenged non-immunized cattle. When administered subcutaneously to adult cattle, the vaccine elicited CPS-specific antibody responses with the same or a higher titre than animals vaccinated with the live vaccine. Pathology in the group of immunized animals was significantly reduced (57%) after challenge with Mmm strain Afadé compared to the non-immunized group, a figure in the range of the protection provided by the live vaccine. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2016

Since CBPP pathogenesis is based on host inflammatory reactions, we have determined the capacity of recombinant GlpO to generate in vivo protective responses against challenge in immunized cattle. We also investigated whether sera raised against recombinant GlpO in cattle and mice inhibit production of H2O2 by Mmm. Immunization of cattle with recombinant GlpO did not protect against challenge with a virulent strain of Mmm. Further, although both murine and bovine antisera raised against recombinant GlpO detected recombinant and native forms of GlpO in immunoblot assays with similar titres, only murine antibodies could neutralize GlpO enzymatic function.

PPRV is an economically significant disease that continues to be a major obstacle to the development of sustainable agriculture across the developing world. The current understanding of PPRV pathogenesis has been heavily assumed from the closely related rinderpest virus (RPV) and other morbillivirus infections alongside data derived from field outbreaks. There have been few studies reported that have focused on the pathogenesis of PPRV and very little is known about the processes underlying the early stages of infection. In the present study, 15 goats were challenged by the intranasal route with a virulent PPRV isolate, Côte d'Ivoire '89 (CI/89) and sacrificed at strategically defined time-points post infection to enable pre- and post-mortem sampling. This approach enabled precise monitoring of the progress and distribution of virus throughout the infection from the time of challenge, through peak viraemia and into a period of convalescence. Observations were then related to findings of previous field studies and experimental models of PPRV to develop a clinical scoring system for PPRV. Importantly, histopathological investigations demonstrated that the initial site for virus replication is not within the epithelial cells of the respiratory mucosa, as has been previously reported, but is within the tonsillar tissue and lymph nodes draining the site of inoculation. We propose that virus is taken up by immune cells within the respiratory mucosa which then transport virus to lymphoid tissues where primary virus replication occurs, and from where virus enters circulation. Based on these findings we propose a novel clinical scoring methodology for PPRV pathogenesis and suggest a fundamental shift away from the conventional model of PPRV pathogenesis. © 2013 Pope et al.",2013

The methods used included an in-house complement fixation test (CFT), a commercially available CFT, a competitive antibody ELISA (cELISA) and the immunoblotting test (IBT). In addition, lung tissue samples were examined by culture.Results: A total of 89% (51/59) of all experimentally infected animals tested positive on at least one of the serological tests throughout the trial. The specific antibody titres to the MmmSC infection became positive first by CFT (6 to 9 days post infection [dpi]), followed by IBT (9 to 13 dpi) and cELISA (13 to 16 dpi). Individual animals were found to display remarkably distinct seroconversion patterns, which allowed their classification into i) early high responders, ii) late high responders, and iii) low responders. In accordance with other studies, none of the present serological tests was capable of detecting all CBPP infected animals.Conclusion: Comparison of the assays' performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity raises serious questions as to their reliability for identification of infected individuals in the field. In view of these limitations, a combination of CFT and cELISA can markedly improve CBPP diagnosis at single-animal level. © 2011 Schubert et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2011

The re-emergence of CBPP in Europe in the 1980s and 1990s illustrates that it is still a threat also to countries that have successfully eradicated the disease in the past. Nowadays, probe-based real-time PCR techniques are among the most advanced tools for a reliable identification and a sensitive detection of many pathogens, but only few protocols have been published so far for CBPP diagnosis. Therefore we developed a novel TaqMan®-based real-time PCR assay comprising the amplification of two independent targets (MSC_0136 and MSC_1046) and an internal exogenous amplification control in a multiplex reaction and evaluated its diagnostic performance with clinical samples.Results: The assays detected 49 MmmSC strains from diverse temporal and geographical origin, but did not amplify DNA from 82 isolates of 20 non-target species confirming a specificity of 100%. The detection limit was determined to be 10 fg DNA per reaction for the MSC_0136 assay and 100 fg per reaction for the MSC_1046 assay corresponding to 8 and 80 genome equivalents, respectively. The diagnostic performance of the assay was evaluated with clinical samples from 19 experimentally infected cattle and from 20 cattle without CBPP and compared to those of cultivation and a conventional PCR protocol. The two rt-PCR tests proved to be the most sensitive methods and identified all 19 infected animals. The different sample types used were not equally suitable for MmmSC detection. While 94.7% of lung samples from the infected cohort were positively tested in the MSC_0136 assay, only 81% of pulmonal lymph nodes, 31% of mediastinal lymph nodes and 25% of pleural fluid samples gave a positive result.Conclusions: The developed multiplex rt-PCR assay is recommended as an efficient tool for rapid confirmation of a presumptive CBPP diagnosis in a well-equipped laboratory environment. © 2011 Schnee et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2011

The role of innate or acquired cell mediated and humoral immunity in conferring protection against MmmSC infection has not yet been elucidated. On the other hand, the pathological lesions caused by the aetiological agent have been considered indicative of an immunopathological process. In this study ten naïve cattle were exposed to in-contact infection with animals infected by intubation with a strain of MmmSC. Clinical signs, antibody response, IFNγ release and pathological changes at necropsy were analysed and compared with the events following in-contact infection of an equal number of animals kept under daily treatment with cyclosporine for the entire observation period of 84 days. Cyclosporine is a suppressor of the immune response related to the T-cell system. Under the conditions of the experiment, cyclosporine appeared to condition the pathogenesis of CBPP by delaying the events that follow infection, bringing further support to the possibility that the immune response may have an impact on the disease outcome.",2007

The disease was experimentally reproduced in zebu cattle by contact. Clinical signs, postmortem and microbiological findings were used to evaluate the degree of infection. Serum and bronchial lavage fluids (BAL) were collected sequentially, before contact and over a period of one year after contact. The kinetics of the different antibody isotypes to MmmSC was established. Based on the severity of the clinical signs, post mortem and microbiological findings, the animals were classified into three groups as acute form with deaths, sub-acute to chronic form and resistant animals. Seroconversion was never observed for the control animals throughout the duration of the experiment, nor for those classified as resistant. Instead, seroconversion was measured for all other cattle either with acute or sub-acute to chronic forms of the disease. For these animals, IgM, IgG1, IgG2 and IgA responses were detected in the serum and BAL samples. The kinetics of the IgM, IgG1 and IgG2 responses was nearly similar between both groups of animals. No evident correlation could thus be established between the levels of these isotypes and the severity of the disease. Levels of IgA were high in both BAL and serum samples of animals with sub-acute to chronic forms of the disease, and tended to persist throughout the entire experimental period. In contrast, animals with acute forms of the disease showed low levels of IgA in their BAL samples with none or very transient but low levels of IgA in the serum samples. Our results thus demonstrated that IgA is produced locally in MmmSC experimentally infected cattle by contact and may play a role in protection against contagious bovine pleuropneumonia. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2006.",2006

Previously, a marker vaccine (RPV-PPRFH) was produced for the control of peste des petits ruminants (PPR) disease, where the F and H genes of Rinderpest virus (RPV) were replaced with the equivalent genes from Peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV); however, this virus grew poorly in tissue culture. The poor growth of the RPV-PPRFH chimeric virus was thought to be due to non-homologous interaction of the surface glycoproteins with the internal components of the virus, in particular with the M protein. In contrast, replacement of the M gene of RPV with that from PPRV did not have an effect on the viability or replication efficiency of the recombinant virus. Therefore, in an effort to improve the growth of the RPV-PPRFH virus, a triple chimera (RPV-PPRMFH) was made, where the M, F and H genes of RPV were replaced with those from PPRV. As expected, the growth of the triple chimera was improved; it grew to a titre as high as that of the unmodified PPRV, although comparatively lower than that of the parental RPV virus. Goats infected with the triple chimera showed no adverse reaction and were protected from subsequent challenge with wild-type PPRV. The neutralizing-antibody titre on the day of challenge was ∼ 17 times higher than that in the RPV-PPRFH group, indicating RPV-PPRMFH as a promising marker-vaccine candidate. © 2006 SGM.",2006

With this aim in mind, we have identified M. mycoides SC-specific genetic loci and developed TaqMan-based PCR assays for the detection of M. mycoides SC. The TaqMan assay allows for real-time detection of specific, amplified PCR products using portable equipment, enabling testing to be performed in the field. These assays are specific for M. mycoides SC, failing to amplify DNA from other organisms belonging to the M. mycoides cluster or two phylogenetically unrelated bovine mycoplasma species. Standard curves were drawn based on the linear relationships measured between the threshold fluorescence (CT) values and a measured quantity of genomic DNA.

The viral genome is flanked at the 3′ and 5′ genome termini by the genome promoter (GP) and antigenome promoter (AGP), respectively. These promoters play essential roles in directing replication and transcription as well as RNA encapsidation and packaging. It has previously been shown that individual changes to the GP of RPV greatly affect promoter activity in a minigenome assay and it was therefore proposed that individual nucleotide changes in the GP and AGP might also have significant effects on the ability of the virus to replicate and cause disease in cattle. The Plowright vaccine strain of RPV has been derived by tissue-culture passage from the virulent Kabete 'O' isolate (KO) and is highly attenuated for all ruminant species in which it has been used. Here, it was shown that swapping the GP and the first 76 nt of the AGP between virulent and avirulent strains affected disease progression. In particular, it was shown that flanking the virulent strain with the vaccine GP and AGP sequences, while not appreciably affecting virus growth in vitro, led to attenuation in vivo. The reverse was not true, since the KO promoters did not alter the vaccine's attenuated nature. The GP/AGP therefore play a role in attenuation, but are not the only determinants of attenuation in this vaccine. © 2005 SGM.",2005

More than 86% (13 of 15) animals died between 9 and 13 days post inoculation at the height of temperature or when temperatures were declining. Necropsy findings included congestion of gastrointestinal tract (GIT), nasal sinuses, consolidation of antero-ventral lobes of lungs, engorged spleen, and occasionally oedematous lymph nodes. Histopathological examination of major organs of GIT revealed degeneration and necrosis of labial mucosa, severe mucosal and submucosal congestion, degeneration and necrosis of intestinal epithelium and lymphoid cell depletion from Peyer's patches along with presence of syncytia at times. Lungs showed broncho-interstitial changes and presence of intra-cytoplasmic and intranuclear eosinophilic inclusions in alveolar macrophages and syncytial cells. These changes in lungs were frequently complicated with serofibrinous pneumonia (57%, eight of 14). Lymphocytolysis and occasional syncytia formation were evident in the lymphoid tissues. Immunohistochemical (IHC) findings included presence of PPR virus antigen in the labial, intestinal, and bronchiolar epithelial cells, pneumocytes, macrophages and syncytial cells in lungs, and lymphoid (intact and necrotic) and reticular cells in lymphoid organs. The findings of the study indicated the highly virulent nature of the PPR virus isolate (PPR/Izatnagar/94), causing 100% mortality and characteristic pathological changes in the target organs such as lungs, intestines and lymphoid tissues.

The properties of this vaccine, including its heat stability, efficacy in short-term trials, safety and genetic stability, have been confirmed in an earlier report. In the present study, the duration of the protective immunity generated by the vaccine in cattle was examined for up to 3 years following the administration of a single vaccination dose of 108 p.f.u. The vaccinated cattle were kept for 2 (group I) or 3 years (group II) and then challenged with a highly virulent strain of RPV. Four of five vaccinated cattle in group I and all six cattle in group II survived the challenge, some showing solid immunity without any clinical signs of rinderpest. Neutralizing antibodies were maintained at a significant level for up to 3 years and they increased rapidly following challenge. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to RPV were examined in group II cattle and were observed in four of the six vaccinated cattle in this group. The long lasting protective immunity, in addition to the other properties confirmed previously, indicate the practical usefulness of this vaccine for field use.",2000

To improve on currently available vaccines against PPR, we have created cDNA copies of the RP virus genome in which either the fusion (F) or hemagglutinin (H) gene, or both, was replaced with the corresponding gene from PPR virus. It was necessary to develop a modified rescue system in which the T7 RNA polymerase was provided by a recombinant fowlpox virus and the entire rescue procedure took place in Veto cells before we could obtain live virus from these chimeric constructs. No virus was recovered when only one of the glycoprotein genes was changed, but a chimeric virus containing both F and H genes from PPR virus was reproducibly rescued from cDNA, indicating that a virus-specific functional interaction takes place between the F and H proteins. The rescued virus expressing the PPR glycoproteins grew more slowly in tissue culture than either parental virus and formed abnormally large syncytia. Goats infected with the chimera showed no adverse reaction, as assessed by clinical signs, temperature, leukocyte count, virus isolation, and serology, and were protected from subsequent challenge with wild-type PPR virus.",2000

The two specific oligonucleotide primer pairs were chosen to match those sequence segments of the P72 gene which differ most from the gene of the closely related lipoprotein P67 of Mycoplasma sp. bovine group 7 (strain PG50). The nested PCR reacted with all of the 34 different strains of M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC analysed, and gave no amplification product with any of the closely related mycoplasmas tested, showing its high specificity. In bronchial lavage fluid experimentally contaminated with M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC, the assay was able to detect as few as two viable cells per ml using a simple lysis procedure prior to the amplification step. With clinical samples, the sensitivity of the nested PCR was about 104-105 higher than that of single PCR amplifications performed under the same conditions.

No mortality was noticed in sheep, whereas one calf died on Day 10 post-infection. In the second phase of the experiment, virus recovered from the reactor calf was subinoculated into another calf and sheep. The calf showed classical signs of rinderpest. In sheep, anorexia and diarrhoea were the only two signs noticed. Duration of leukopenia associated with reduced lymphocytes was 3 days in sheep whereas in calves for 8 days.

Two sets of primers were designed; one set (MC323/MC358) to amplify a ∼1.5-kbp DNA fragment from all the members of the M. mycoides ‘Cluster’ and the other set (MM450/MM451) specifically amplified a 574-bp DNA fragment from M. mycoides subspecies. The PCR products could be differentiated further by digestion with the restriction enzyme AsnI. Enzyme digestion of amplification products from M. m. mycoides SC produced 2 fragments, whereas the other 2 M. mycoides subspecies, M. m. mycoides LC and M. m. capri, produced 3 fragments. This test was shown to be very sensitive, being able to detect between 10 and 100 organisms. Cattle were experimentally infected with the Gladysdale strain of M. m. mycoides SC, and samples of serum and mucus were taken periodically, as were postmortem samples of lung, lymph node, pleural fluid, synovial fluid, and tracheal swabs. Complement fixation test on serum samples, culture of postmortem tissues, and histopathologic examination confirmed disease. DNA was extracted from postmortem samples and amplified by PCR using primers MM450 and MM451. Digestion of products using AsnI allowed the specific identification of M. m. mycoides SC.

Three epidemiologically distinct events appear to have occurred: repeated outbreaks in West Pokot district related to cross-border movement of stock, an outbreak in Marsabit district in 1987 (thought to have been caused by illegal movement of cattle, possibly in vehicles, from countries further north) and a series of related outbreaks in and near Nairobi between 1988 and 1989 due to the unauthorized movement from abattoirs and holding grounds of slaughter stock possibly introduced from West Pokot or Marsabit. In West Pokot the disease affected unvaccinated calves and yearlings. In Marsabit cattle of all ages were affected. In August 1988, a major outbreak was confirmed in Kiambu and Kajiado districts in central Kenya, near Nairobi. At the same time a provisional diagnosis of rinderpest was made in a herd of cattle at a slaughterhouse in Nairobi. Rinderpest virus was isolated from sick cattle in all the outbreaks. Experimental infection of susceptible cattle with the Kiambu isolate demonstrated this to be of low virulence. Emergency vaccination and quarantine measures instituted immediately after confirmation eliminated clinical disease within three to four weeks in West Pokot, Kiambu and Nairobi. In Kajiado, however, the disease persisted for at least nine months, during which time a series of virus isolates was recovered. There was no evidence of infection in susceptible wildlife.

A great interest in developing an effective and safe vaccine against ASF virus (ASFV) infection has, therefore, recently appeared. The objective of the present study is to test an inactivated ASFV preparation under a vaccination strategy that has not previously been tested in order to improve its protective effect. The following have been considered: (i) virus inactivation by using a low binary ethyleneimine (BEI) concentration at a low temperature, (ii) the use of new and strong adjuvants; (iii) the use of very high doses (6 × 109 haemadsorption in 50% of infected cultures (HAD50 )), and (iv) simultaneous double inoculation by two different routes of administration: intradermal and intramuscular. Five groups of pigs were, therefore, inoculated with BEI-Pol16/DP/OUT21 in different adjuvant formulations, twice with a 4-week interval. Six weeks later, all groups were intramuscularly challenged with 10 HAD50 of the virulent Pol16/DP/OUT21 ASFV isolate. All the animals had clinical signs and pathological findings consistent with ASF. This lack of effectiveness supports the claim that an inactivated virus strategy may not be a viable vaccine option with which to fight ASF. © 2021 by the authors.

ASF is caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV) that consists of a large dsDNA genome that encodes for more than 160 genes; few of these genes have been studied in detail. ASFV contains four multi-gene family (MGF) groups of genes that have been implicated in regulating the immune response and host specificity; however, the individual roles of most of these genes have not been well studied. Here, we describe the evaluation of the previously uncharacterized ASFV MGF110-1L open reading frame (ORF) using a deletion mutant of the ASFV currently circulating throughout Eurasia. The recombinant ASFV lacking the MGF110-1L gene (ASFV-G-ΔMGF110-1L) demonstrated in vitro that the MGF110-1L gene is non-essential, since ASFV-G-ΔMGF110-1L had similar replication kinetics in primary swine macrophage cell cultures when compared to parental highly virulent field isolate Georgia2007 (ASFV-G). Experimental infection of domestic pigs with ASFV-G-ΔMGF110-1L produced a clinical disease similar to that caused by the parental ASFV-G, confirming that deletion of the MGF110-1L gene from the ASFV genome does not affect viral virulence.",2021

Although a number of vaccine candidates have been reported, none are commercially available yet. To explore the effect of unknown genes on the biological characteristics of ASFV and the possibility of a gene-deleted isolate as a vaccine candidate, the strain SY18ΔL7-11, with deletions of L7L-L11L genes from ASFV SY18, was constructed, and its biological properties were analyzed. The results show that deletion of genes L7L-L11L did not affect replication of the virus in vitro. Virulence of SY18△L7-11 was significantly reduced, as 11 of the 12 pigs survived for 28 days after intramuscular inoculation with a low dose (103 TCID50) or a high dose (106 TCID50) of SY18ΔL7-11. All 11 surviving pigs were completely protected against challenge with the parental ASFV SY18 on 28 days postinoculation (dpi). Transient fever and/or irregularly low levels of genomic DNA in the blood were monitored in some pigs after inoculation. No ASF clinical signs or viremia were monitored after challenge. Antibodies to ASFV were induced in all pigs from 14 to 21 days postinoculation. IFN-γ was detected in most of the inoculated pigs, which is usually inhibited in ASFV-infected pigs. Overall, the results demonstrate that SY18ΔL7-11 is a candidate for further constructing safer vaccine(s), with better joint deletions of other gene(s) related to virulence.",2021

The current continent-wide pandemic has persisted for over 10 years, and its economy-devastating effect was highlighted after spreading to China, which possesses half of the world pig industry. So far, development of an effective and safe vaccine has not been finished largely due to the knowledge gaps in pathogenesis and immunology, particularly the role of cytokines in the host's immune response. Therefore, we performed experiments in domestic pigs to analyze the kinetics of representative circulating interferons (IFNs), interleukins (ILs), growth factors, tumor necrosis factors (TNFs), and chemokines induced by infection of type II virulent ASFV SY18. Pigs infected with this Chinese prototypical isolate developed severe clinical manifestations mostly from 3 days post inoculation (dpi) and died from 7 to 8 dpi. Serum analysis revealed a trend of robust and sustained elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IFN-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IL-18, RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), and IFN-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10) from 3 dpi, but not the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Moreover, secondary drastic increase of the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, as well as elevated IL-10, was observed at the terminal phase of infection. This pattern of cytokine secretion clearly drew an image of a typical cytokine storm characterized by delayed and dysregulated initiation of the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine and imbalanced pro- and anti-inflammatory response, which paved a way for further understanding of the molecular basis of ASFV pathogenesis. © Copyright © 2021 Wang, Zhang, Zhang, Yang, Wang, Qi, Han, Zhou, Miao, Chen, Wang, Zhang, Zhang and Hu.",2021

Specifically, the highly virulent ASFV strain Georgia 2010 (ASFV-G) is producing disease outbreaks in this large geographical region. The ASFV genome encodes for over 150 genes, most of which are still not experimentally characterized. I8L is a highly conserved gene that has not been studied beyond its initial description as a virus ORF. Transcriptional analysis of swine macrophages infected with ASFV-G demonstrated that the I8L gene is transcribed early during the virus replication cycle. To assess the importance of I8L during ASFV-G replication in vitro and in vivo, as well as its role in virus virulence in domestic swine, we developed a recombinant virus lacking the I8L gene (ASFV-G-ΔI8L). Replication of ASFV-G-ΔI8L was similar to parental ASFV-G replication in primary swine macrophage cultures, suggesting that the I8L gene is not essential for ASFV-G replication in vitro. Similarly, replication of ASFV-G-ΔI8L in swine intramuscularly inoculated with 102 HAD50 displayed replication kinetics similar to ASFV-G. In addition, animals inoculated with ASFV-G-ΔI8L presented with a clinical disease indistinguishable from that induced by the same dose of the virulent parental ASFV-G isolate. We conclude that deletion of the I8L gene from ASFV-G does not affect virus replication in vitro or in vivo, nor changes the disease outcome in swine.",2020

ASF emerged in China in August 2018 and has since rapidly spread into many areas of the country. The disease has caused a significant impact on China’s pig and related industries. A safe and effective vaccine is needed to prevent and control the disease. Several gene-deleted ASFVs have been reported; however, none of them is safe enough and commercially available. In this study, we report the generation of a double gene-deleted ASFV mutant, ASFV-SY18-∆CD2v/UK, from a highly virulent field strain ASFV-SY18 isolated in China. The results showed that ASFV-SY18-∆CD2v/UK lost hemadsorption properties, and the simultaneous deletion of the two genes did not significantly affect the in vitro replication of the virus in primary porcine alveolar macrophages. Furthermore, ASFV-SY18-∆CD2v/UK was attenuated in pigs. All the ASFV-SY18-∆CD2v/UK-inoculated pigs remained healthy, and none of them developed ASF-associated clinical signs. Additionally, the ASFV-SY18-∆CD2v/UK-infected pigs developed ASFV-specific antibodies, and no virus genome was detected in blood and nasal discharges at 21 and 28 days post-inoculation. More importantly, we found that all the pigs inoculated with 104 TCID50 of ASFV-SY18-∆CD2v/UK were protected against the challenge with the parental ASFV-SY18. However, low-level ASFV DNA was detected in blood, nasal swabs, and lymphoid tissue after the challenge. The results demonstrate that ASFV-SY18-∆CD2v/UK is safe and able to elicit protective immune response in pigs and can be a potential vaccine candidate to control ASF. © 2020 by the authors.

In addition, several natural ASFV isolates showing decreased virulence in swine has been shown to be non-hemadsorbing suggesting an association between altered or deleted forms of 8DR and virus attenuation. Here we demonstrate that deletion of 8DR gene from the genome of ASFV Georgia2010 isolate (ASFV-G-Δ8DR) does not significantly alter the virulence of the virus. ASFV-G-Δ8DR inoculated intramuscularly or intranasally (in a range of 102 to 104 TCID50) produced a clinical disease in domestic pigs indistinguishable from that induced by the same doses of the virulent parental ASFV Georgia2010 isolate. In addition, viremia values in ASFV-G-Δ8DR do not differ from those detected in animals infected with parental virus. Therefore, deletion of 8DR gene is not associated with a noticeable decrease in virulence of the ASFV Georgia isolate. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020

We aimed to identify suitable sample matrices for use in ASF surveillance programs. Six pigs inoculated with ASFV were sampled at postmortem.

Ct values provided by the rtPCR assays were correlated, and ASFV was detected in all oral, nasal, and rectal swabs and in all ear biopsy samples irrespective of the location from which they were taken. The LAMP assay had lower sensitivity, and detected ASFV in 54 of 66 positive samples, but delivered positive results within 17 min. We identified additional sample matrices that can be considered depending on the sampling situation: bone marrow had a high probability of detection, which could be useful for decomposed carcasses. However, ear biopsies provide an appropriate, high-throughput sample matrix to detect ASFV and may be useful during surveillance programs. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020

AHS causes serious losses in developing countries where horses play a central role in draft power and transportation. There are nine AHSV serotypes inducing no or low cross-neutralizing antibodies. AHSV is spread by biting Culicoides midges. AHS is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, and a serious threat outside Africa, since Culicoides species in moderate climate conditions are spreading the closely related bluetongue virus. AHS outbreaks will be devastating for the equestrian industry in developed countries. Live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs) are licensed, marketed and in use in Africa. Their application is controversial with regard to safety issues. LAVs are not allowed in AHS-free countries. We here studied inactivated AHSV with different adjuvants in guinea pigs and horses. Subcutaneous and intramuscular vaccination were studied in horses. Local reactions were observed after prime and boost vaccination. In general, neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) titres were very low after prime vaccination, whereas boost vaccination resulted in high nAb titres for some adjuvants. Vaccinated horses were selected based on local reactions and nAb titres to study efficacy. Unfortunately, not all vaccinated horses survived virulent AHSV infection. Further, most survivors temporarily developed clinical signs and viremia. Further, the current prototype inactivated AHS vaccine is not suitable as emergency vaccine, because onset of protection is slow and requires boost vaccinations. On the other hand, inactivated AHS vaccine is completely safe with respect to virus spread, and incorporation of the DIVA principle based on NS3/NS3a serology and exploring a vaccine production platform for other serotypes is feasible. A superior adjuvant increasing the protective response without causing local reactions will be required to develop payable and acceptable inactivated AHS vaccines. © 2020 The Authors",2020

Here, we presented the previously uncharacterized ASFV gene MGF360-1L, the first gene in the genome. The kinetic studies of virus RNA transcription demonstrated that the MGF360-1L gene was transcribed as a late virus protein. The essentiality of MGF360-1L to virus replication was evaluated by developing a recombinant ASFV lacking the gene (ASFV-G-∆MGF360-1L). In primary swine macrophage cell cultures, ASFV-G-∆MGF360-1L showed similar replication kinetics as the parental highly virulent field isolate Georgia2007 (ASFV-G). Domestic pigs experimentally infected with ASFV-G-∆MGF360-1L presented with a clinical disease indistinguishable from that caused by ASFV-G, demonstrating that MGF360-1L was not involved in virulence in swine, the natural host of ASFV. © 2020 by the authors.

There is no commercial vaccine available, making the culling of infected animals the current solution to control outbreaks. Effective experimental vaccines have been developed by deleting virus genes associated with virulence. Deletion of the ASFV 9GL gene (∆9GL) has resulted in the attenuation of different ASFV strains, although the degree of attenuation varies across isolates. Here, we investigated the possibility of the increased safety of the experimental vaccine strain ASFV-G-∆9GL by deleting two additional virus genes involved in pathogenesis, CD2v, a CD2 like viral encoded gene from the EP402R open reading frame (ORF), and C-type lectin-like viral gene, encoded from the EP153R ORF. Two new recombinant viruses were developed, ASFV-G-∆9GL/∆CD2v and ASFV-G-∆9GL/∆CD2v/∆EP153R, harboring two and three gene deletions, respectively. ASFV-G-∆9GL/∆CD2v/∆EP153R, but not ASFV-G-∆9GL/∆CD2v, had a decreased ability to replicate in vitro in swine macrophage cultures when compared with parental ASFV-G-∆9GL. Importantly, ASFV-G-∆9GL/∆CD2v and ASFV-G-∆9GL/∆CD2v/∆EP153R induced almost undetectable viremia levels when inoculated into domestic pigs and failed to protect them against challenge with parental virulent ASFV-Georgia, while ASFV-G-∆9GL offered robust protection during challenge. Therefore, the deletion of CD2-like and C-type lectin-like genes significantly decreased the protective potential of ASFV-G-∆9GL as a vaccine candidate. This study constitutes an example of the unpredictability of genetic manipulation involving the simultaneous deletion of multiple genes from the ASFV genome. © 2020 by the authors.

ASFV-G is highly virulent and continues to be maintained in these outbreak areas, apparently without suffering significant genomic or phenotypic changes. When comparing the genome of ASFV-G to other isolates, a thus-far uncharacterized gene, X69R, is highly conserved and, interestingly, is similar to another ASFV uncharacterized gene, J64R. All sequenced ASFV isolates have one or both of these genes, X69R or J64R, suggesting that the presence of at least one of these genes may be necessary for ASFV replication and or virulence. The X69R gene is present in the ASFV-G genome while J64R is absent. To assess the importance of X69R in ASFV-G functionality, we developed a recombinant virus by deleting the X69R gene from the ASFV-G genome (ASFV-G-∆X69R). ASFV-G-∆X69R had the same replication kinetics in primary swine macrophage cultures as the parental ASFV-G, indicating that the X69R gene is not essential for ASFV-G viability or efficient replication in the main target cell during in vivo infection. In addition, swine intramuscularly inoculated with a low dose (102 HAD50) of ASFV-G-∆X69R developed a clinical disease indistinguishable from that induced by the same dose of the virulent parental ASFV-G isolate. Viremia values of ASFV-G-∆X69R did not significantly differ from those detected in animals infected with parental virus. Therefore, deletion of the X69R gene from ASFV-G does not affect virus replication or virulence in swine. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2020

The results obtained in the present study show that a single intramuscular immunization of domestic pigs with OURT88/3 or BeninΔMGF followed by a challenge with the virulent Benin 97/1 isolate at day 130 postimmunization did not trigger the mechanisms necessary to generate immunological memory able to induce long-term protection against disease. All pigs developed acute forms of acute swine fever (ASF). Gamma interferon-producing cells peaked at day 24 postimmunization, declining thereafter. Surprisingly, the levels of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were elevated at the end of the experiment, suggesting that regulatory components of the immune system may inhibit effective protection. IMPORTANCE The duration of immunity for any vaccine candidate is crucial. In the case of African swine fever virus vaccine candidates, this issue has received little attention. Attenuated viruses have proven protective following short immunization protocols in which pigs were challenged a few weeks after the first immunization. Here, the duration of immunity and the immune responses induced over a duration of 130 days were studied during prechallenge and after challenge of pigs immunized with the naturally attenuated isolate OURT88/3 and an attenuated gene-deleted isolate, BeninΔMGF. After a single intramuscular immunization of domestic pigs with the OURT88/3 isolate or BeninΔMGF virus, animals were not protected against challenge with the virulent Benin 97/1 ASFV genotype I isolate at day 130 postimmunization.

Over the last decade, the disease has spread to several European and Asian countries and is now one of the major threats to profitable pig production worldwide. One of the more recently affected western countries is Belgium. To date, only wild boar are affected in a rather defined area in the Luxembourg region close to France, Luxembourg and Germany. While detailed sequence analyses were recently performed, biological characterization was still pending. Here, we report on the experimental inoculation of four sub-adult wild boar to further characterize the virus and its distribution in different tissues. After oronasal inoculation with the virus strain ‘Belgium 2018/1’, all animals developed an acute and severe disease course with typical pathomorphological and histopathological lesions. Organs and blood samples were positive in qPCR, haemadsorption test and antigen lateral flow devices (LFD). Virus and viral genome were also detected in genitals and accessory sex glands of two boars. There were no antibodies detectable in commercial antibody ELISAs, antibody LFDs and indirect immunoperoxidase tests. Thus, the genotype II ASF virus isolate ‘Belgium 2018/1’ showed a highly virulent phenotype in European wild boar similar to parental viruses like Armenia 2007 and other previously characterized ASFV strains. The study also provided a large set of well-characterized sample materials for test validation and assay harmonization. © 2020 The Authors.

A recombinant ASFV lacking the C962R gene (ASFV-G-ΔC962R) demonstrates in vivo that the C962R gene is non-essential, since ASFV-G-ΔC962R has similar replication kinetics in primary swine macrophage cell cultures when compared to parental highly virulent field isolate Georgia2007 (ASFV-G). Experimental infection of domestic pigs with ASFV-G-ΔC962R produced a clinical disease similar to that caused by the parental ASFV-G, confirming that deletion of the C962R gene from the ASFV genome does not impact virulence. © 2020 by the authors.",2020

Infection with the naturally attenuated OURT88/3 strain induces protection against challenge with virulent isolates from the same or closely related genotypes. However, adverse clinical signs following immunisation have been observed. Here, we attempted to increase the OURT88/3 safety profile by deleting I329L, a gene previously shown to inhibit the host innate immune response. The resulting virus, OURT88/3ΔI329L, was tested in vitro to evaluate the replication and expression of type I interferon (IFN) and in vivo by immunisation and lethal challenge experiments in pigs. No differences were observed regarding replication; however, increased amounts of both IFN-β and IFN-α were observed in macrophages infected with the deletion mutant virus. Unexpectedly, the deletion of I329L markedly reduced protection against challenge with the virulent OURT88/1 isolate. This was associated with a decrease in both antibody levels against VP72 and the number of IFN-γ-producing cells in the blood of non-protected animals. Furthermore, a significant increase in IL-10 levels in serum was observed in pigs immunised with OURT88/3ΔI329L following challenge.

The disease is devastating the swine industry in Central Europe and East Asia, with current outbreaks caused by circulating strains of ASFV derived from the 2007 Georgia isolate (ASFV-G), a genotype II ASFV. In the absence of any available vaccines, African swine fever (ASF) outbreak containment relies on the control and culling of infected animals. Limited cross-protection studies suggest that in order to ensure a vaccine is effective, it must be derived from the current outbreak strain or at the very least from an isolate with the same genotype. Here, we report the discovery that the deletion of a previously uncharacterized gene, I177L, from the highly virulent ASFV-G produces complete virus attenuation in swine. Animals inoculated intramuscularly with the virus lacking the I177L gene, ASFV-G-ΔI177L, at a dose range of 102 to 106 50% hemadsorbing doses (HAD50), remained clinically normal during the 28-day observational period. All ASFV-G-ΔI177Linfected animals had low viremia titers, showed no virus shedding, and developed a strong virus-specific antibody response; importantly, they were protected when challenged with the virulent parental strain ASFV-G. ASFV-G-ΔI177L is one of the few experimental vaccine candidate virus strains reported to be able to induce protection against the ASFV Georgia isolate, and it is the first vaccine capable of inducing sterile immunity against the current ASFV strain responsible for recent outbreaks. IMPORTANCE Currently, there is no commercially available vaccine against African swine fever. Outbreaks of this disease are devastating the swine industry from Central Europe to East Asia, and they are being caused by circulating strains of African swine fever virus derived from the Georgia 2007 isolate. Here, we report the discovery of a previously uncharacterized virus gene, which when deleted completely attenuates the Georgia isolate. Importantly, animals infected with this genetically modified virus were protected from developing ASF after challenge with the virulent parental virus. Interestingly, ASFV-G-ΔI177L confers protection even at low doses (102 HAD50) and remains completely attenuated when inoculated at high doses (106 HAD50), demonstrating its potential as a safe vaccine candidate. At medium or higher doses (104 HAD50), sterile immunity is achieved. Therefore, ASFV-G-ΔI177L is a novel efficacious experimental ASF vaccine protecting pigs from the epidemiologically relevant ASFV Georgia isolate. Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

This article also attempts to indicate risk, related to virus load and shedding, and present possible difficulties with proper disease recognition at the farm level. The results revealed that even a very low dose (5 HAU) may initiate the infection. Various forms of the disease (acute, subacute, and chronic), mainly with prodromal clinical signs like fever, apathy, and reduced feed intake were observed. The most frequently observed lesions (82%) were: hyperemia and enlargement of lymph nodes and splenomegaly. The minimal incubation period was estimated at five days post-infection (dpi). Mortality ranged from 80–100%. Two pigs survived the infection. Some viremic animals presented delayed fever. In some cases, the fever was not detectable. Shortly after viremia, the virus was secreted ion the urine, feces, and saliva. The highest levels of virus were found in the internal organs and blood; however in the case of one pig (chronic form), viral DNA was not detected in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and brain.

To determine if such oral ingestion is an alternative pathway of transmission, O. erraticus ticks were infected by blood-feeding on a viremic pig infected with the European African swine fever virus strain Georgia2007/1, then frozen at zero and two months post-engorgement, then after, were embedded in the food to pigs.

Erraticus and O. Verrucosus, for African swine fever virus strains circulating in Eurasia","African swine fever (ASF) is a lethal hemorrhagic disease in domestic pigs and wild suids caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV), which threatens the swine industry globally. In its native African enzootic foci, ASFV is naturally circulating between soft ticks of the genus Ornithodoros, especially in the O. moubata group, and wild reservoir suids, such as warthogs (Phacochoerus spp.) that are bitten by infected soft ticks inhabiting their burrows. While the ability of some Afrotropical soft ticks to transmit and maintain ASFV is well established, the vector status of Palearctic soft tick species for ASFV strains currently circulating in Eurasia remains largely unknown. For example, the Iberian soft tick O. erraticus is a known vector and reservoir of ASFV, but its ability to transmit different ASFV strains has not been assessed since ASF re-emerged in Europe in 2007. Little is known about vector competence for ASFV in other species, such as O. verrucosus, which occurs in southern parts of Eastern Europe, including Ukraine and parts of Russia, and in the Caucasus. Therefore, we conducted transmission trials with two Palearctic soft tick species, O. erraticus and O. verrucosus, and the Afrotropical species O. moubata. We tested the ability of ticks to transmit virulent ASFV strains, including one of direct African origin (Liv13/33), and three from Eurasia that had been involved in previous (OurT88/1), and the current epizooties (Georgia2007/1 and Ukr12/Zapo). Our experimental results showed that O. moubata was able to transmit the African and Eurasian ASFV strains, whereas O. erraticus and O. verrucosus failed to transmit the Eurasian ASFV strains. However, naïve pigs showed clinical signs of ASF when inoculated with homogenates of crushed O. erraticus and O. verrucosus ticks that fed on viraemic pigs, which proved the infectiousness of ASFV contained in the ticks. These results documented that O. erraticus and O. verrucosus are unlikely to be capable vectors of ASFV strains currently circulating in Eurasia. Additionally, the persistence of infection in soft ticks for several months reaffirms that the infectious status of a given tick species is only part of the data required to assess its vector competence for ASFV.

For this, we used pigs that had survived an ASFV infection, had recovered from disease, and had become carriers of ASFV. These clinically healthy carriers were put together one-by-one with naive contact pigs. Two of the twelve contact pigs developed an acute ASFV infection. Using the results of the experiment we quantified the transmission parameters βcarrier (0.039/day) and Tcarrier (25.4 days). With the survival rate of 0.3 for our ASFV isolate, these parameter values translate into the contribution of carriers to R0 in groups of pigs being 0.3. Further, we placed naive contact pigs in an ASFV contaminated environment. Here, no contact infections were observed. Our findings show that clinically healthy carriers can be a source of acute new infections, which can contribute to the persistence of ASFV in swine populations.

In August 2018, there was an outbreak in China and in April 2019, ASFV was reported in Vietnam and Cambodia. Since no vaccine or treatment exists, a vaccine is needed to safeguard the swine industry. Previously, we evaluated immunogenicity of two adenovirus-vectored cocktails containing ASFV antigens and demonstrated induction of unprecedented robust antibody and T cell responses, including cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In the present study, we evaluated protective efficacy of both cocktails by intranasal challenge of pigs with ASFV-Georgia 2007/1. A nine antigen cocktail-(I) formulated in BioMize adjuvant induced strong IgG responses, but when challenged, the vaccinees had more severe reaction relative to the controls. A seven antigen cocktail-(II) was evaluated using two adjuvants: BioMize and ZTS-01. The BioMize formulation induced stronger antibody responses, but 8/10 vaccinees and 4/5 controls succumbed to the disease or reached experimental endpoint at 17 days post-challenge. In contrast, the ZTS-01 formulation induced weaker antibody responses, but 4/9 pigs succumbed to the disease while the 5 survivors exhibited low clinical scores and no viremia at 17 days post-challenge, whereas 4/5 controls succumbed to the disease or reached experimental endpoint.

We demonstrated that deletion of the UK gene from the ASFV-G genome did not decrease virulence when compared to the parental virus. Conversely, deletion of the NL gene produced a heterogeneous response, with early death in one of the animals and transient fever in the other animals. With this knowledge, we attempted to increase the safety profile of the previously reported experimental vaccine ASFV-G∆9GL/∆UK by deleting the NL gene. A triple gene-deletion virus was produced, ASFV-G∆9GL/∆NL/∆UK. Although ASFV-G∆9GL/∆NL/∆UK replicated in primary cell cultures of swine macrophages, it demonstrated a severe replication deficiency in pigs, failing to induce protection against challenge with parental ASFV-G. © 2019 by the authors.

In this study, an ASFV isolate, Pig/Heilongjiang/2018 (Pig/HLJ/18), was isolated in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) from a pig sample from an ASF outbreak farm. The isolate was characterized by using the haemadsorption (HAD) test, Western blotting and immunofluorescence, and electronic microscopy. Phylogenetic analysis of the viral p72 gene revealed that Pig/HLJ/18 belongs to Genotype II. Infectious titres of virus propagated in primary PAMs and pig marrow macrophages were as high as 107.2 HAD50/ml. Specific-pathogen-free pigs intramuscularly inoculated with different virus dosages at 103.5–106.5 HAD50 showed acute disease with fever and haemorrhagic signs. The incubation periods were 3–5 days for virus-inoculated pigs and 9 days for contact pigs. All virus-inoculated pigs died between 6–9 days post-inoculation (p.i.), and the contact pigs died between 13–14 days post-contact (p.c.). Viremia started on day 2 p.i. in inoculated pigs and on day 9 p.c. in contact pigs. Viral genomic DNA started to be detected from oral and rectal swab samples on 2–5 days p.i. in virus-inoculated pigs, and 6–10 days p.c. in contact pigs. These results indicate that Pig/HLJ/18 is highly virulent and transmissible in domestic pigs. Our study demonstrates the threat of ASFV and emphasizes the need to control and eradicate ASF in China. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Therefore, feeding of swill to pigs is regulated or prohibited in many swine-rearing countries. African swine fever is one of the major porcine diseases recognized as significant in this transmission pathway. Assessment of disease risks associated with pork products requires knowledge about the viral load in the original material and for how long infectious virus can be recovered from the resulting product. In this work, we present the effect of the dry curing process on the inactivation of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in three different Italian dry-cured meat products prepared from experimentally infected pigs slaughtered at the peak of viremia. The meat products were processed using commercial methods and industrial procedures currently being followed in Italy. Samples collected at predetermined intervals during processing were analyzed for virus survival by virus isolation and animal inoculation. ASFV was detected by in vivo experiments for up to 18, 60, and 83 days of curing in Italian salami, pork belly, and loin, respectively.

Recent outbreaks of the virus in Trans-Caucasus countries, Eastern Europe, Belgium and China highlight the urgent need to develop effective vaccines against ASFV. Previously, we evaluated the immunogenicity of a vaccination strategy designed to test various combinations of ASFV antigens encoded by DNA plasmids and recombinant proteins with the aim to activate both humoral and cellular immunity. Based on our previous results, the objective of this study was to test the combined DNA-protein vaccine strategy using a cocktail of the most immunogenic antigens against virulent ASFV challenge. Pigs were vaccinated three times with a cocktail that included ASFV plasmid DNA (CD2v, p72, p32, +/−p17) and recombinant proteins (p15, p35, p54, +/−p17). Three weeks after the third immunization, all pigs were challenged with the virulent ASFV Armenia 2007 strain. The results showed that vaccinated pigs were not protected from ASFV infection or disease. Compared to the non-vaccinated controls, earlier onset of clinical signs, viremia, and death were observed for the vaccinated animals following virulent ASFV challenge. ASFV induced pathology was also enhanced in the vaccinated pigs. Furthermore, while the vaccinated pigs developed antigen-specific antibodies, immunized pig sera at the time of challenge lacked the capacity to neutralize virus, and instead was observed to enhance ASFV infection in vitro. The results of this work points to a putative immune enhancement mechanism involved in ASFV pathogenesis that warrants further investigation. This pilot study provides insight for the selection of appropriate combinations of ASFV antigens for the development of a rationally-designed, safe, and efficacious vaccine for ASF. © 2019 by the authors.

The discovery of virus specific miRNAs has increased both in number and importance in the past few years. We have recently described the differential expression of several porcine miRNAs during in vivo infection with attenuated and virulent ASFV strains. Here, we have extended these studies trying to identify the presence of viral miRNAs encoded by ASFV in an in vivo infection in pigs. Results: Sixteen small RNA libraries were analyzed from spleen and submandibular lymph nodes obtained from eight pigs, seven infected with either the virulent E75 ASFV strain or its attenuated counterpart E75CV1, or from pigs surviving E75CV1-infection and challenged with BA71 (heterologous challenge) and one non infected as negative control. Samples were recovered at different times post-infection. Libraries were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. Some viral miRNA candidates were initially identified, which did not correspond to porcine miRNAs. Further structural analyses were carried out in order to confirm if they met the conformational requirements to be considered a viral miRNA. Conclusions: The analysis of sixteen small RNA libraries prepared from two different tissues obtained from pigs experimentally infected with E75, E75CV1 or with E75CV1 plus BA71, revealed the presence of six potential miRNA sequences but none of them met the requirements to be considered as viral miRNAs. Thus, we can conclude that ASFV does not express miRNAs in vivo, at least under the experimental conditions described here. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018

In 2017, the virus spread further west and the first cases of disease were reported in the Czech Republic and Romania, in wild boar and domestic pigs, respectively. To control further spread, knowledge of different modes of transmission, including indirect transmission via a contaminated environment, is crucial. Up until now, such an indirect mode of transmission has not been demonstrated. In this study, transmission via an environment contaminated with excretions from ASFV-infected pigs was investigated. Following euthanasia of pigs that were infected with an isolate of ASFV from Poland (POL/2015/Podlaskie/Lindholm), healthy pigs were introduced into the pens, in which the ASFV-infected pigs had been housed. Introduction was performed at 1, 3, 5 or 7 days, following euthanasia of the infected pig groups. Pigs, that were introduced into the contaminated environment after 1 day, developed clinical disease within 1 week, and both ASFV DNA and infectious virus were isolated from their blood. However, pigs introduced into the contaminated pens after 3, 5 or 7 days did not develop any signs of ASFV infection and no viral DNA was detected in blood samples obtained from these pigs within the following 3 weeks. Thus, it was shown that exposure of pigs to an environment contaminated with ASFV can result in infection. However, the time window for transmissibility of ASFV seems very limited, and, within our experimental system, there appears to be a rapid decrease in the infectivity of ASFV in the environment. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2018

The ever-increasing evidence of seropositive wild boar in certain areas suggests that some animals may be surviving for some time or could even be recovering from the disease. This could be due to acquired immunity after the primary infection and/or the presence of related viruses of reduced virulence. To assess these hypotheses, two ASFV field strains from Estonia were studied in vivo in two groups of domestic pigs. After an incubation period of 4 ± 1.6 days, the pigs inoculated intramuscularly with Es15/WB-Tartu 14 ASFV (group 2) developed clinical signs associated with acute disease and succumbed 7 and 11 days post infection (dpi). Pigs inoculated with Es15/WB-Valga-14 ASFV (group 1) had longer incubation times (8 days) than those in group 2 and developed variable clinical signs and lesions compatible with subacute and chronic forms of ASF; they succumbed at 11 and 25 dpi. The in-contact pigs in both groups became infected 7–14 days after exposure and exhibited variable clinical manifestations and pathological findings ranging from acute to chronic disease. Two animals per group recovered completely after infection and were protected against a subsequent homologous virus challenge-exposure performed at 78 dpi. Under experimental conditions, no transmission occurred from the survivors to susceptible sentinel pigs housed together with the survivors 137 days after the primary infection. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018

Results demonstrated a strong correlation between both doses and routes of immunisation of BeninΔMFG and the percentage of protection achieved, the onset of clinical signs, the viremia levels reached and the onset of death in non-protected pigs. The results show that the intramuscular route using high doses (104 TCID50) is the best option for immunisation.

HPAIV detection from feathers had been evaluated for H5N1 or H7N1 HPAIVs. It was suggested that viral RNA loads could be equivalent or higher in samples of immature feather compared to tracheal (TS) or cloacal swabs (CS). We investigated the suitability of feathers for the detection of clade 2.3.4.4b H5N8 HPAIV in ducks and geese field samples. In the six H5N8 positive flocks that were included in this study, TS, CS and immature wing feathers were taken from at least 10 birds. Molecular loads were then estimated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) targetting H5 and M genes. In all flocks, viral loads were at least equivalent between feather and swab samples and in most cases up to 103 higher in feathers. Bayesian modelling confirmed that, in infected poultry, RT-qPCR was much more likely to be positive when applied on a feather sample only (estimated sensitivity between 0.89 and 0.96 depending on the positivity threshold) than on a combination of a tracheal and a cloacal swab (estimated sensitivity between 0.45 and 0.68 depending on the positivity threshold). Viral tropism and lesions in feathers were evaluated by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Epithelial necrosis of immature feathers and follicles was observed concurrently with positive viral antigen detection and leukocytic infiltration of pulp. Accurate detection of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAIVs in feather samples were finally confirmed with experimental H5N8 infection on 10-week-old mule ducks, as viral loads at 3, 5 and 7 days post-infection were higher in feathers than in tracheal or cloacal swabs. However, feather samples were associated with lower viral loads than tracheal swabs at day 1, suggesting better detectability of the virus in feathers in the later course of infection. These results, based on both field cases and experimental infections, suggest that feather samples should be included in the toolbox of samples for detection of clade 2.3.4.4b HPAI viruses, at least in ducks and geese. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021

Here, we tested experimental vector herpesvirus of turkey (vHVT)-H5 vaccines containing either wild-type clade 2.3.4.4A-derived H5 inserts or computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) inserts with challenge by homologous and genetically divergent H5 HPAI Gs/GD lineage viruses in chickens. Direct assessment of protection was confirmed for all the tested constructs, which provided clinical protection against the homologous and heterologous H5 HPAI Gs/GD challenge viruses and significantly decreased oropharyngeal shedding titers compared to the sham vaccine. The cross reactivity was assessed by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) and focus reduction assay against a panel of phylogenetically and antigenically diverse H5 strains. The COBRA-derived H5 inserts elicited antibody responses against antigenically diverse strains, while the wild-type-derived H5 vaccines elicited protection mostly against close antigenically related clades 2.3.4.4A and 2.3.4.4D viruses. In conclusion, the HVT vector, a widely used replicating vaccine platform in poultry, with H5 insert provides clinical protection and significant reduction of viral shedding against homologous and heterologous challenge.

This virus, A/chicken/Kagawa/11C/2020 (Kagawa11C2020), was the first HPAI poultry isolate in Japan in 2020 and had multiple basic amino acids-a motif conferring high pathogenicity to chickens-at the hemagglutinin cleavage site. Mortality of chickens was 100% through intravenous inoculation tests performed according to World Organization for Animal Health criteria. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the hemagglutinin of Kagawa11C2020 belongs to clade 2.3.4.4B of the H5 Goose/Guangdong lineage and clusters with H5N8 HPAIVs isolated from wild bird feces collected in Hokkaido (Japan) and Korea in October 2020. These H5N8 HPAIVs are closely related to H5N8 HPAIVs isolated in European countries during the winter of 2019-2020. Intranasal inoculation of chickens with 106 fifty-percent egg infectious doses of Kagawa11C2020 revealed that the 50% chicken lethal dose was 104.63 and the mean time to death was 134.4 h. All infected chickens demonstrated viral shedding beginning on 2 dpi-before clinical signs were observed.

Emergency vaccination could be an alternative as vaccination is one of the most efficient and cost-effective measures to protect poultry from HPAI infection, preventing spreading to other poultry and greatly reducing the potential transmission to humans. Current conventional inactivated AI vaccines may be useful for combating AI outbreaks, but do not fulfil all targets of an ideal AI vaccine, including mass applicability and rapid onset of immunity. We aimed to further investigate the potential of Herpesvirus of Turkeys (HVT) as a vector containing a recombinant H5 hemagglutinin of HPAI H5N1. This HVT-H5 vector was analysed in vitro, tested for onset of immunity against AI challenge, breadth of protection, reduction of virus shedding, and induction of both antibody and cellular responses in SPF layers or broiler chicks containing maternal derived antibodies (MDA+). In SPF layers HVT-H5 provided full protection to lethal challenges with 4 antigenically diverse HPAI H5N1 strains from 2 weeks post vaccination (w.p.v.), while in MDA+ birds full protection was provided from 3 w.p.v. to homologous challenge. Also shedding of challenge virus was reduced in both SPF and MDA+ birds. HVT-H5 induced a protective HI titre (≥4) to 11 HPAI H5N1 strains at 3 w.p.v. in 3-week-old SPF layers and to HPAI H5N8 A/ch/Neth/14015531/2014. Besides inducing a protective antibody response HVT-H5 also induced an influenza-specific T cell response. This data demonstrates that HVT-H5 vaccine appears to fulfil many of the criteria for an ideal AI vaccine including early onset of immunity, a broad protection, reduced virus shedding, protection in presence of AI-MDA and could be a useful tool in the combat of AI outbreaks worldwide. © 2021 The Authors",2021

The safety of both vaccines was evaluated in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens. To evaluate the efficacy of the prepared vaccines, 2-week-old SPF chickens were vaccinated with 0.5 mL of a vaccine formula containing 108/EID50 /dose from each strain via the subcutaneous route. Vaccinated birds were challenged with either wild-type HPAI-H5N8 or H5N1 viruses separately at 3 weeks post-vaccine. Results revealed that both vaccines induced protective hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibody titers as early as 2 weeks PV (≥5.0 log2). Vaccinated birds were protected clinically against both subtypes (100 % protection). HPAI-H5N1 virus shedding was significantly reduced in birds that were vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine; meanwhile, HPAI-H5N8 virus shedding was completely neutralized in both tracheal and cloacal swabs after 3 days post-infection in birds that had been vaccinated with either vaccine. In conclusion, the developed bivalent vaccine proved to be efficient in protecting chickens clinically and reduced virus shedding via the respiratory and digestive tracts.

Available data indicate that pigeons play a minimum role in the epidemiology of AI. However, a degree of variation exists in the susceptibility of pigeons to highly pathogenic AI viruses (HPAIVs), especially since the emergence of the goose/Guangdong H5 lineage. Here, the pathogenesis of H5N8 HPAIV in comparison with a H7N1 HPAIV and the role of pigeons in the epidemiology of these viruses were evaluated. Local and urban pigeons (Columba livia var. domestica) were intranasally inoculated with 105 ELD50 of A/goose/Spain/IA17CR02699/2017 (H5N8) or A/Chicken/Italy/5093/1999 (H7N1) and monitored during 14 days. Several pigeons inoculated with H5N8 or H7N1 seroconverted. However, clinical signs, mortality, microscopic lesions and viral antigen were only detected in a local pigeon inoculated with H5N8 HPAIV. This pigeon presented prostration and neurological signs that correlated with the presence of large areas of necrosis and widespread AIV antigen in the central nervous system, indicating that the fatal outcome was associated with neurological dysfunction. Viral RNA in swabs was detected in some pigeons inoculated with H7N1 and H5N8, but it was inconsistent, short-term and at low titres. The present study demonstrates that the majority of pigeons were resistant to H5N8 and H7N1 HPAIVs, despite several pigeons developing asymptomatic infections. The limited viral shedding indicates a minimum role of pigeons as amplifiers of HPAIVs, regardless of the viral lineage, and suggests that this species may represent a low risk for environmental contamination. RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS H7N1 and H5N8 HPAIVs can produce subclinical infections in pigeons. The mortality caused by H5N8 HPAIV in one pigeon was associated with neurological dysfunction.

Vaccines are important in HPAIV control both for poultry and in prepandemic preparedness for humans. This study assessed inactivated prepandemic vaccine strains in a One Health framework across human and agricultural and wildlife animal health, focusing on the genetic and antigenic diversity of field H5N1 Gs/GD viruses from the agricultural sector and assessing cross-protection in a chicken challenge model. Nearly half (47.92%) of the 48 combinations of vaccine and challenge viruses examined had bird protection of 80% or above. Most vaccinated groups had prolonged mean death times (MDT), and the virus-shedding titers were significantly lower than those of the sham-vaccinated group (P ≤ 0.05). The antibody titers in the prechallenge sera were not predictive of protection. Although vaccinated birds had higher titers of hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) antibodies against the homologous vaccine antigen, most of them also had lower or no antibody titer against the challenge antigen. The comparison of all parameters and homologous or closely related vaccine and challenge viruses gave the best prediction of protection. Through additional analysis, we identified a pattern of epitope substitutions in the hemagglutinin (HA) of each challenge virus that impacted protection, regardless of the vaccine used. These changes were situated in the antigenic sites and/or reported epitopes associated with virus escape from antibody neutralization. As a result, this study highlights virus diversity, immune response complexity, and the importance of strain selection for vaccine development to control H5N1 HPAIV in the agricultural sector and for human prepandemic preparedness. We suggest that the engineering of specific antigenic sites can improve the immunogenicity of H5 vaccines. IMPORTANCE The sustained circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 A/goose/Guangdong/1996 (Gs/GD) lineage in the agricultural sector and some wild birds has led to the evolution and selection of distinct viral lineages involved in escape from vaccine protection. Our results using inactivated vaccine candidates from the human pandemic preparedness program in a chicken challenge model identified critical antigenic conformational epitopes on H5 hemagglutinin (HA) from different clades that were associated with antibody recognition and escape. Even though other investigators have reported epitope mapping in the H5 HA, much of this information pertains to epitopes reactive to mouse antibodies. Our findings validate changes in antigenic epitopes of HA associated with virus escape from antibody neutralization in chickens, which has direct relevance to field protection and virus evolution. Therefore, knowledge of these immunodominant regions is essential to proactively develop diagnostic tests, improve surveillance platforms to monitor AIV outbreaks, and design more efficient and broad-spectrum agricultural and human prepandemic vaccines. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

This is of particular concern in Bangladesh, where highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of the A(H5N1) subtype are endemic and cocirculate with other influenza viruses. Active surveillance of avian influenza viruses in Bangladeshi live poultry markets detected three A(H5) genotypes, designated H5N1-R1, H5N1-R2, and H5N2-R3, that arose from reassortment of A(H5N1) clade 2.3.2.1a viruses. The H5N1-R1 and H5N1-R2 viruses contained HA, NA, and M genes from the A(H5N1) clade 2.3.2.1a viruses and PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and NS genes from other Eurasian influenza viruses. H5N2-R3 viruses contained the HA gene from circulating A(H5N1) clade 2.3.2.1a viruses, NA and M genes from concurrently circulating A(H9N2) influenza viruses, and PB2, PB1, PA, NP, and NS genes from other Eurasian influenza viruses. Representative viruses of all three genotypes and a parental clade 2.3.2.1a strain (H5N1-R0) infected and replicated in mice without prior adaptation; the H5N2-R3 virus replicated to the highest titers in the lung. All viruses efficiently infected and killed chickens. All viruses replicated in inoculated ferrets, but no airborne transmission was detected, and only H5N2-R3 showed limited direct-contact transmission. Our findings demonstrate that although the A(H5N1) viruses circulating in Bangladesh have the capacity to infect and replicate in mammals, they show very limited capacity for transmission. However, reassortment does generate viruses of distinct phenotypes. Copyright © 2020 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.",2020

The currently available avian influenza H5N1 vaccines for poultry are clade-specific. Therefore, an effective vaccine for preventing and controlling H5N1 viruses belonging to different clades needs to be developed. Results: Recombinant L. lactis/pNZ8148-Spax-HA was generated, and the influenza virus haemagglutinin (HA) protein of A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) was displayed on the surface of Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis). Spax was used as an anchor protein. Chickens vaccinated orally with unadjuvanted L. lactis/pNZ8148-Spax-HA could produce significant humoral and mucosal responses and neutralizing activities against H5N1 viruses belonging to different clades. Importantly, unadjuvanted L. lactis/pNZ8148-Spax-HA conferred cross-clade protection against lethal challenge with different H5N1 viruses in the chicken model. Conclusion: This study provides insights into the cross-clade protection conferred by unadjuvanted L. lactis/pNZ8148-Spax-HA, and the results might help the establishment of a promising platform for the development of a safe and effective H5N1 cross-clade vaccine for poultry. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020

Besides culling measures in infected farms in endemic areas, vaccination is the major tool against HPAIV. However, the mainly used inactivated preparations have several limitations, like application to the individual animal by injection and a reduced efficiency. Here we present a modified live influenza vaccine prototype, which is based on the H17N10 bat influenza virus. The new chimeric vaccine strain R65mono/H17N10 was able to provide full protection against a lethal challenge infection with HPAIV H5N1 of juvenile and subadult chickens, as well as ferrets after oronasal immunization. In addition, the H5 vaccine prototype cannot reassort with avian influenza viruses and therefore is a promising tool against HPAIV H5 infection, allowing new vaccination strategies for efficient disease control. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020

Dabbling ducks play a recognized role in the maintenance and transmission of AIVs. Furthermore, the pathogenesis of highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) in dabbling ducks is well characterized. In contrast, the role of diving ducks in HPAIV maintenance and transmission remains unclear. In this study, the pathogenesis of a North American A/Goose/1/Guangdong/96-lineage clade 2.3.4.4 group A H5N2 HPAIV, A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014, in diving sea ducks (surf scoters, Melanitta perspicillata) was characterized. Results: Intrachoanal inoculation of surf scoters with A/Northern pintail/Washington/40964/2014 (H5N2) HPAIV induced mild transient clinical disease whilst concomitantly shedding high virus titers for up to 10 days post-inoculation (dpi), particularly from the oropharyngeal route. Virus shedding, albeit at low levels, continued to be detected up to 14 dpi. Two aged ducks that succumbed to HPAIV infection had pathological evidence for co-infection with duck enteritis virus, which was confirmed by molecular approaches. Abundant HPAIV antigen was observed in visceral and central nervous system organs and was associated with histopathological lesions. Conclusions: Collectively, surf scoters, are susceptible to HPAIV infection and excrete high titers of HPAIV from the respiratory and cloacal tracts whilst being asymptomatic. The susceptibility of diving sea ducks to H5 HPAIV highlights the need for additional research and surveillance to further understand the contribution of diving ducks to HPAIV ecology. © 2020 The Author(s).",2020

However, the severity of infection varies depending of the viral strain and the genetic background of the host. In this study, we evaluated the pathogenesis of two HPAIVs (H7N1 and H5N8) and assessed the susceptibility to the infection of local and commercial chicken breeds from Spain. Eight chicken breeds were intranasally inoculated with 105 ELD50 of A/Chicken/Italy/5093/1999 (H7N1) or A/Goose/Spain/IA17CR02699/2017 (H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4. B) and monitored during 10 days. Chickens were highly susceptible to both HPAIVs, but H7N1 was considerably more virulent than H5N8 as demonstrated by the highest mortality rates and shortest mean death times (MDT). Both HPAIVs produced severe necrosis and intense viral replication in the central nervous system, heart and pancreas; however, the lesions and replication in other tissues were virus-dependent. High levels of viral RNA were detected by the oral route with both viruses. In contrast, a low number of H5N8-inoculated chickens shed by the cloacal route, demonstrating a different pattern of viral shedding dependent of the HPAIV. We found a high variation in the susceptibility to HPAIVs between the different chicken breeds. The birds carrying the genotype AA and AG at position 2032 in chicken Mx gene presented a slightly higher, but not significant, percentage of survival and a statistically significant longer MDT than GG individuals.

One explanation for tenacity of H5N2 LPAI in Mexico is the antigenic divergence of circulating field viruses compared to licensed vaccines due to antigenic drift. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that the H5N2 LPAI viruses circulating in Mexico and neighboring countries since 1994 have undergone antigenic drift away from vaccine seed strains. Here we evaluated the efficacy of a new recombinant fowlpox virus vector containing an updated H5 insert (rFPV-H5/2016), more relevant to the current strains circulating in Mexico. We tested the vaccine efficacy against a closely related subcluster 4 Mexican H5N2 LPAI (2010 H5/LP) virus and the historic H5N2 HPAI (1995 H5/HP) virus in White Leghorn chickens. The rFPV-H5/2016 vaccine provided hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers pre-challenge against viral antigens from both challenge viruses in almost 100% of the immunized birds, with no differences in number of birds seroconverting or HI titers among all tested doses (1.5, 2.0, and 3.1 log10 mean tissue culture infectious doses/bird). The vaccine conferred 100% clinical protection and a significant decrease in oral and cloacal virus shedding from 1995 H5/HP virus challenged birds when compared to the sham controls at all tested doses. Virus shedding titers from vaccinated 2010 H5/LP virus challenged birds significantly decreased compared to sham birds especially at earlier time points. Our results confirm the efficacy of the new rFPV-H5/2016 against antigenic drift of LPAI virus in Mexico and suggest that this vaccine would be a good candidate, likely as a primer in a prime-boost vaccination program. © 2019",2020

In this present study, we assessed the pathogenicity of the clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 HPAIV in American kestrels (Falco sparverius) with a view to prevent future outbreaks in raptors. The kestrels were intranasally inoculated with the virus or fed the meat of chicks that had died from viral infection. Kestrels in both groups initially reduced food intake, showed clinical signs such as depression and neurologic manifestations, and succumbed to the infection within six days. The kestrels primarily shed the virus orally one day post-inoculation until death, with an average titer of 104.5—5.7 EID50/mL, which is comparable to the inoculum titer. The viruses replicated in almost all tested tissues; notably, the feather calamuses also contained infectious virions and/or viral genes. Pancreatic lesions were present in several infected birds, as shown in previous cases of HPAIV infection in raptors. These results indicate that kestrels are highly susceptible to infection by clade 2.3.2.1 H5 HPAIVs, which readily occurs through the consumption of infected animal carcasses. Early detection and removal of HPAIV infected carcasses in the field is essential for preventing outbreaks in raptors.

The objective of the study presented in this paper was to test the efficacy of the commercially available HVT-based recombinant H5 vaccine against antigenically drifted H5N1, H5N8 and H5N2 HPAI virus circulating in Egypt recently. Groups of SPF chicks vaccinated at day-old with the HVT-based recombinant H5 vaccine were challenged, along with non-vaccinated controls, with 106 EID50 each of H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8 HPAI virus at 28 days of age. The animals were monitored for clinical protection and virus shedding during a 10 days post-challenge period. Clinical protection was 90%, 90% and 80% following challenge with the H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8 field isolates, respectively. Challenge virus shedding was significantly reduced in vaccinated groups, with up to 40%, 30% and 20% of non-shedders and 3.8, 3.3 and 2.8 log10 reduction in the amount of excreted virus following challenge with H5N1, H5N2 and H5N8 viruses, respectively. Analyses of the amino acid sequences of the HA proteins of challenge viruses and serological relatedness with the vaccine insert revealed significant antigenic divergences between the vaccine and the challenge viruses. These results provide further evidence on the potential of HVT-based recombinant H5 vaccine to provide cross-protection against antigenically drifted HPAI H5Nx viruses with strong control on virus shedding. © 2020, © 2020 Houghton Trust Ltd.",2020

To analyse the role of mallards in the spatiotemporal dynamics of global HPAIV H5N8B dispersal, mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), naturally exposed to various AIV and therefore seropositive, were challenged with H5N8B. All experiments were controlled by infection and co-housing of seronegative juvenile Pekin ducklings. All ducks that survived the first infection were re-challenged 21 dpi with the homologous H5N8B strain. After the first H5N8B infection, seropositive mallards showed only mild clinical symptoms. Moderate to low viral shedding, occurring particularly from the oropharynx and lasting for 7 days maximum, led to severe clinical disease of all contact ducklings. All challenged seronegative Pekin ducks and contact ducklings died or had to be euthanized. H5-specific antibodies were detected in surviving birds within 2 weeks. Virus and viral RNA could be isolated from several water samples until 6 and 9 dpi, respectively. Conversely, upon re-infection with homologous H5N8B neither inoculated nor contact ducklings showed any clinical symptoms, nor was an antibody titer increase of seropositive mallards or any seroconversion of contact ducklings observed. Mallard ducks naturally pre-exposed to LPAIV can play a role as a clinically unsuspicious virus reservoir for H5N8B effective in virus transmission. Mallards with homologous immunity did not contribute to virus transmission. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The effectivity of IgY anti-Hemagglutinin Protein (anti-HA) of High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) clade 2.1 (A/Chicken/Blitar/2003) was tested against infection of High Pathogenic Avian Influenza clade 2.3.2 (A/Duck/Sidoarjo/2012). The inhibiting activity was observed through Immunohistochemistry. Sixty chickens were infected with 105 EID50/ml of HPAI clade 2.3.2 (A/Duck/Sidoarjo/2012). Yolk Immunoglobulin with different amounts (0 μg, 100 μg, 200 μg and 400 μg) were administered at three different times which were 24 hours before infection, at the time of infection, and 24 hours after infection. The observation was conducted for 7 days. During post infection observation, death chickens were managed for immunohistochemistry assay to observe the present of virion and IgY sialic acid 2,3-alfa galactosa (SA α 2,3 gal) blocking activity in septa alveoli. By the end of observation all chickens were euthanized for immunohistochemistry assay. The result showed that anti-HA IgY obtained from HPAI clade 2.1 could protecting infection of HPAI clade 2.3.2. According to immunohistochemistry assay, the administration of IgY can neutralize the infecting virus marked by the number of virions observed in septa alveoli of the lungs. Regarding the assay, the dose of 200 μg and 400 μg of IgY applied 24 hours before the infection, can reduce clinical signs and mortality of infected chicken (80-100%). The best dose of the IgY to protect them from infection of clade 2.3.2 (A/Duck/Sidoarjo/2012) was 400 μg administered 24 hours before infection. It could be concluded that administration of IgY anti-Haemaglutinin Protein (anti-HA) of High Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) clade 2.1 (A/Chicken/Blitar/2003) could protect chickens against the infection of HPAI clade 2.3.2 (A/Duck/Sidoarjo/2012), even though they belong different clades.

The H7N9 low pathogenic influenza virus was inserted into four amino acids in the HA protein cleavage site to mutate into the H7N9 highly pathogenic virus. This emerging virus caused 15 outbreaks in chickens from the end of 2016 to date. Two H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) strains, A/chicken/Guangdong/A46/2013 (LPAIV) and A/chicken/Guangdong/Q29/2017 (HPAIV), were selected to compare the pathogenicity and transmissibility between H7N9 LPAIVs and HPAIVs in chickens. We inoculated 3- to 4-week-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens with 6 log10EID50/0.1 mL viruses via the ocular-nasal route and co-housed four chickens in each group. The inoculated chicken mortality rate in the A46 and Q29 groups was 1/5 and 5/5, respectively. Q29 virus replication was more efficient compared to the A46 virus in inoculated chickens. Infected chickens initiated viral shedding to naïve contact chickens through respiratory and digestive routes. Both viruses transmitted between chickens by naïve contact, but the Q29 virus had a higher pathogenicity in contact chickens than the A46 virus. Compared with early H7N9 LPAIVs, the pathogenicity and transmissibility of the emerging H7N9 HPAIV was stronger in chickens, indicating that H7N9 influenza virus may continue to threaten human and poultry health. © 2019 by the authors.",2019

In comparison with the virus inoculum, viral sequences obtained from the chickens had a higher number of nucleotide changes but lower intra-host genomic diversity than viral sequences obtained from the mallards. These observations are consistent with population bottlenecks occurring when viruses infect and replicate in a host that it is not well adapted to. Whether these observations apply to influenza viruses in general remains to be determined. © 2019",2019

This has caused huge losses in the poultry industry. In this study, we analysed the genetic characteristics of seven H5N6 HPAIVs of clade 2.3.4.4 that infected birds in Southern China in 2016. Phylogenetic analysis grouped the HA, PB2, PA, M and NS genes as MIX-like, and the NA genes grouped into the Eurasian lineage. The PB1 genes of the GS24, GS25, CK46 and GS74 strains belonged to the VN 2014-like group and the others were grouped as MIX-like. The NP genes of GS24 and GS25 strains belonged to the ZJ-like group, but the others were MIX-like. Thus, these viruses came from different genotypes, and the GS24, GS25, CK46 and GS74 strains displayed genotype recombination. Additionally, our results showed that the mean death time of all chickens inoculated with 105 EID50 of CK46 or GS74 viruses was 3 and 3.38 days, respectively. The viruses replicated at high titers in all tested tissues of the inoculated chickens. They also replicated in all tested tissues of naive contact chickens, but their replication titers in some tissues were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05). Thus, the viruses displayed high pathogenicity and variable transmission in chickens. Therefore, it is necessary to focus on the pathogenic variation and molecular evolution of H5N6 HPAIVs in order to prevent and control avian influenza in China. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2019

We showed that the A/tundra swan/Tottori/C6nk/2014 (H5N8) (Tottori P0) strain required 10 days to kill all chickens via the intranasal route. However, Tottori P1-B, a strain recovered from the brain of a chicken infected with parental Tottori P0, showed enhanced pathogenicity; Tottori P1-B replicated significantly in the lung and liver, and killed all infected birds within 6 days, which was comparable to a chicken farm isolate obtained in the same season, A/environment/Miyazaki/11/2014 (H5N8). Tottori P1-B showed more marked proliferation in MDCK and chicken fibroblast cells, especially during the early phase of infection. Sequence analysis revealed a single mutation, M374 V, in nucleoprotein (NP) of the passaged virus, and this substitution was conserved after a further inoculation study. Position 374 in NP is located in the functional domain interacting with polymerase protein, PB2, indicating that viral polymerase activity was involved in the rapid growth of Tottori P1-B in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that HPAIV, which originally had comparatively low pathogenicity to chickens, can increase its pathogenicity through the infection from migratory birds to domestic chickens. © 2019",2019

As part of a long-term, 36-week study, chickens were challenged at seven weeks of age after receiving a single vaccination, at 18 weeks of age following a vaccine prime-single boost, and at 36 weeks of age after a prime- double-boost. All vaccine programmes reduced virus oropharyngeal and cloacal shedding and mortality compared to the non-vaccinated control birds; however, chickens receiving at least one administration of the RP vaccine generally had diminished viral shedding especially from the cloacal swabbings. A detectable serum antibody response and protection were observed through 18 weeks post-vaccination. Our data suggest that, in conjunction with a comprehensive eradication, enhanced biosecurity and controlled marketing plan, vaccination programmes of commercial layer chickens with novel RP vaccines may represent an important tool for preventing HPAI-related mortalities and decreasing viral load during a catastrophic influenza outbreak.

In order to determine changes in virus pathogenicity and adaptation in avian species, three H7N3 HPAI viruses from 2012, 2015, and 2016 were evaluated in chickens and mallards. All three viruses caused high mortality in chickens when given at medium to high doses and replicated similarly. No mortality or clinical signs and similar infectivity were observed in mallards inoculated with the 2012 and 2016 viruses. However, the 2012 H7N3 HPAI virus replicated well in mallards and transmitted to contacts, whereas the 2016 virus replicated poorly and did not transmit to contacts, which indicates that the 2016 virus is less adapted to mallards. In vitro, the 2016 virus grew slower and to lower titers than did the 2012 virus in duck fibroblast cells. Full-genome sequencing showed 115 amino acid differences between the 2012 and the 2016 viruses, with some of these changes previously associated with changes in replication in avian species, including hemagglutinin (HA) A125T, nucleoprotein (NP) M105V, and NP S377N. In conclusion, as the Mexican H7N3 HPAI virus has passaged through large populations of chickens in a span of several years and has retained its high pathogenicity for chickens, it has decreased in fitness in mallards, which could limit the potential spread of this HPAI virus by waterfowl.

Here, we analyzed the genetic properties of 10 H5N6 subtypes AIVs from geese in 2015–2016 in Guangdong province. Phylogenic analysis showed that all HA genes of the 10 viruses belonged to clade 2.3.4.4, and their genes including HA, PA, PB1, M, NP, and NS all derived from Mix-like 1 (CH, VN, LS). Their PB2 genes come from Mix-like 2 (CH, VN, JP). The NA genes were classified into a Eurasian lineage. Therefore, the 10 viruses likely originate from the same ancestor and were all recombinant viruses between different genotypes. We selected A/Goose/Guangdong/GS144/2015(H5N6) (GS144) and A/Goose/Guangdong/GS148/2016(H5N6) (GS148) viruses to inoculate 5-week-old chickens intranasally with 104 EID50 /0.1 mL dose intranasally to assess their pathogenicity and transmissibility. Inoculated chickens showed that the GS144 virus caused systematic infection with a lethality of 100%, but the lethality of GS148 virus was 0%. The two viruses were efficiently transmitted to contact chickens. The lethality of GS144 and GS148 virus in contact with chickens was 87.5% and 0%, respectively, which suggests that the transmissibility of GS144 virus was stronger than GS148 virus in chickens. Thus, different H5N6 viruses from the same waterfowl can show different pathogenicity and transmissibility in chickens. Continued surveillance and characteristic analysis of the H5N6 viruses will help us to keep abreast of evolution and variation in avian influenza viruses in the future. © 2019 by the authors.

Here, the virulence of HPAIV H7N1 (designated H7N1-FPV34 and H7N1-It99) and H7N7 (designated H7N7-FPV27) was assessed in Pekin and/or Muscovy ducklings after intrachoanal (IC) or intramuscular (IM) infection. Results: The morbidity rate ranged from 60 to 100% and mortality rate from 20 to 80% depending on the duck species, virus strain and/or challenge route. All Muscovy ducklings inoculated IC with H7N7-FPV27 or H7N1-FPV34 exhibited mild to severe clinical signs resulting in the death of 2/10 and 8/10 ducklings, respectively. Also, 2/10 and 6/9 of inoculated Muscovy ducklings died after IC or IM infection with H7N1-It99, respectively. Moreover, 5/10 Pekin ducklings inoculated IC or IM with H7N1-It99 died. The level of virus detected in the oropharyngeal swabs was higher than in the cloacal swabs. Conclusion: Taken together, HPAIV H7 cause mortality and morbidity in Muscovy and Pekin ducklings. The severity of disease in Muscovy ducklings depended on the virus strain and/or route of infection. Preferential replication of the virus in the respiratory tract compared to the gut merits further investigation. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019

In the present study, chickens were vaccinated with two different recombinant fowlpox virus vaccines (rFPV-H7/3002 with 2015 H7 hemagglutinin [HA] gene insert, and rFPV-H7/2155 with 2002 H7 HA gene insert), and were then challenged three weeks later with H7N3 HPAI virus (A/chicken/Jalisco/CPA-37905/2015). The rFPV-H7/3002 vaccine conferred 100% protection against mortality and morbidity, and significantly reduced virus shed titers from the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. In contrast, 100% of sham and rFPV-H7/2155 vaccinated birds shed virus at higher titers and died within 4 days. Pre- (15/20) and post- (20/20) challenge serum of birds vaccinated with rFPV-H7/3002 had antibodies detectable by hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay using challenge virus antigen. However, only a few birds (3/20) in the rFPV-H7/2155 vaccinated group had antibodies that reacted against the challenge strain but all birds had antibodies that reacted against the homologous vaccine antigen (A/turkey/Virginia/SEP-66/2002) (20/20). One possible explanation for differences in vaccines efficacy is the antigenic drift between circulating viruses and vaccines. Molecular analysis demonstrated that the Mexican H7N3 strains have continued to rapidly evolve since 2012. In addition, we identified in silico three potential new N-glycosylation sites on the globular head of the H7 HA of A/chicken/Jalisco/CPA-37905/2015 challenge virus, which were absent in 2012 H7N3 outbreak virus. Our results suggested that mutations in the HA antigenic sites including increased glycosylation sites, accumulated in the new circulating Mexican H7 HPAIV strains, altered the recognition of neutralizing antibodies from the older vaccine strain rFPV-H7/2155. Therefore, the protective efficacy of novel rFPV-H7/3002 against recent outbreak Mexican H7N3 HPAIV confirms the importance of frequent updating of vaccines seed strains for long-term effective control of H7 HPAI virus. © 2019",2019

In the present study, we characterized age-related differences in terms of pathology in commercial white broad breasted turkeys inoculated with A/turkey/Minnesota/12582/2015 (H5N2) HPAIV clade 2.3.4.4A, a virus from the largest HPAI poultry outbreak that affected the Unites States in 2014–2015. Turkeys infected at 6-weeks of age showed inapparent to little clinical signs with rapid disease progression, reaching 100% mortality at 3 days post infection (dpi). In contrast, turkeys infected at 16-weeks of age developed ataxia and lethargy and reached 100% mortality by 5 dpi. Infection in the 6-weeks old turkeys resulted in peracute lesions consistent of extensive hemorrhages, edema and necrosis, but inflammation was not prominent. In the 16-weeks old turkeys, necrosis and hemorrhages in tissues were accompanied by a more prominent subacute inflammatory infiltrate. Both age groups showed presence of avian influenza virus (AIV) nucleoprotein (NP) in multiple cell types including neurons, glial cells, ependymal cells, respiratory epithelial cells, air capillary epithelium and pulmonary macrophages, cardiac myocytes, smooth muscle fibers, pancreatic acini and ductal cells. Cells of the vascular walls stained strongly positive for viral antigens, but no positivity was found in the endothelial cells of any organs.

Challenged SPF chickens showed significant decreases in the virus shedding titers up to &lt;3log10 compared to challenge control chickens. No virus shedding was detected 6 “days post-challenge” in all vaccinated challenged groups. Conclusion: Our results indicate that the trivalent H5ND vaccine provides significant clinical protection against different clades of the HPAI viruses including the newly emerging H5N8 HPAI virus. Availability of such potent multivalent oil-emulsion vaccine offers an effective tool against HPAI control in endemic countries and promises simpler vaccination programs. Copyright: Ali, et al.

Forty SPF chicks were divided into four groups of 10 birds each, in which group I served as negative control. Group II was challenged with H5N1 avian influenza virus (positive control) at day 31. Group III was given inactivated vaccine at day 10, then challenged with H5N1 virus at day 31. Group IV was vaccinated with recombinant fowlpox vaccine at day old and boosted with inactivated vaccine at day 10, then challenged with HPAIV at day 31. Quantitative RRT-PCR was carried out on tracheal swabs of living birds and organs of dead birds to evaluate viral load. In addition, specimens from trachea, lungs, bursa of Fabricius, spleen and brain were collected from all birds for histopathologic, immunohistologic and electron microscopic examination. Viral RNA and antigen were demonstrated in examined organs in group II only using indirect immunoperoxidase and quantitative RRT-PCR. The pathological lesions detected were severe in group II, far less in group III and mild in groups I and IV. In conclusion, vaccination regime involving the use of two different vaccines resulted in much alleviation of the pathological alterations and conferred a better protection of chicken against highly pathogenic avian influenza than the use of one vaccine. © 2018 PVJ.

In this study, HPAIVs were administered via intranasal instillation to juvenile and adult domestic ducks, consisting of inoculation and contact groups, for comparative contagiousness. Oropharyngeal (OP) and cloacal (CL) swab analysis showed the overall virus shedding to be higher in OP than in CL. In addition, OP virus titer was higher in adults than in juveniles in the contact group. Our results indicate that adult susceptibility to AIV infection was greater than juvenile susceptibility, in case of samples from inoculated OP swab 2 days past inoculation (dpi) and contact OP swab 7 dpi. AIV distribution in the pancreas in juveniles was higher than that in adults; however, the virus was not detected in the trachea of either adults or juveniles. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that differences in infectivity and prevalence of viruses in adults and juveniles may be influenced by the species of birds and neuraminidase enzymatic activity of the virus. © 2019, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.",2019

We report the identification of novel HPAIV A(H5N8) clade 2.3.4.4 virus that was isolated from sick domestic duck at commercial farm during the second wave of spread that began in October and affected poultry (ducks; chickens) in several European regions of Russia and Western Siberia in 2016. The strain was highly lethal in experimental infection of chickens and mice with IVPI = 2.34 and MLD50 = 1.3log10 = EID50, accordingly. Inoculation of chickens with the HPAIV A/H5N8 demonstrated neuroinvasiveness, multiorgan failure, and death of chickens on the 3rd day post inoculation. Virus replicated in all collected organ samples in high viral titers with the highest titer in the brain (6.75±0.1 log10 TCID50/ml). Effective virus replication was found in the following cells: neurons and glial cells of a brain; alveolar cells and macrophages of lungs; epithelial cells of a small intestine; hepatocytes and Kupffer cells of a liver; macrophages and endothelial cells of a spleen; and the tubular epithelial cells of kidneys. These findings advance our understanding of histopathological effect of A(H5N8) HPAIV infection. © 2019 Elena A. Prokopyeva et al.",2019

In order to determine whether the virus is adapting to wild waterbirds, we experimentally inoculated the HPAI H5N8 virus clade 2.3.4.4 group A from 2014 into four key waterbird species-Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), common teal (Anas crecca), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), and common pochard (Aythya ferina)-and compared virus excretion and disease severity with historical data of the HPAI H5N1 virus infection from 2005 in the same four species. Our results showed that excretion was highest in Eurasian wigeons for the 2014 virus, whereas excretion was highest in common pochards and mallards for the 2005 virus. The 2014 virus infection was subclinical in all four waterbird species, while the 2005 virus caused clinical disease and pathological changes in over 50% of the common pochards.

Vaccination based on commercial H5 vaccines is used as an essential control strategy in Egyptian poultry. Here, we studied the efficacy of the eight most common commercial H5 poultry vaccines in the Egyptian market and compared them with an experimental vaccine based on the Egyptian LPAI H5N8 virus that was prepared by using reverse genetics. The experimental vaccine and Re-5 commercial vaccine were able to completely protect chickens and significantly reduce virus shedding. Our results indicate that most of the commercial poultry H5 vaccines used in the present study were ineffective because the seed viruses in these vaccines are genetically distinct from the H5N8 viruses currently circulating in Egypt. Although some of the commercial vaccines protected chickens from mortality, they failed to prevent chickens from shedding the virus. Accordingly, we recommend updating and reinforcing the H5N8 prevention and control strategies in Egypt. The vaccination strategy should be reconsidered based on currently circulating viruses. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018

HPAIV of subtypes H5 and H7 emerge from precursor viruses of low pathogenicity (LP) by spontaneous mutation associated with a shift in the susceptibility of the endoproteolytic cleavage site of the viral hemagglutinin protein from trypsin- to furin-like proteases. A recently described natural pair of LP/HP H7N7 viruses derived from two spatio-temporally linked outbreaks in layer chickens was used to study how a minority of mutated HP virions after de novo generation in a single host might gain primacy. Co-infection experiments in embryonated eggs and in chickens were conducted to investigate amplification, spread and transmissionof HPAIV within a poultry population that experiences concurrent infection by an antigenically identical LP precursor virus. Simultaneous LPAIV co-infection (inoculum dose of 10 6 egg-infectious dose 50% endpoint (EID 50 )/0.5 mL) withincreasing titers of HPAIV from 10 1 to 10 5.7 EID 50 /0.5 mL) had a significant impeding impact on HP H7 replication, viral excretion kinetics, clinical signs and histopathological lesions (in vivo) and on embryo mortality (in ovo). LP/HP co-infected chickens required a hundredfold higher virus dose (HPAIV inoculum of 10 5 EID 50 ) compared to HPAIV mono-infection (HPAIV inoculum of 10 3 EID 50 ) to develop overt clinical signs, mortality and virus spread to uninfected sentinels. Escape and spread of HP phenotypes after de novo generation in an index host may therefore be highly precarious due to significant competition with co-circulating LP precursor virus. © 2018, The Author(s).",2018

In highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV)-enzootic countries, broiler chickens typically have MDA to Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and H5 HPAIV, and their impact on active immunity from recombinant vectored vaccines is unclear. We assessed the effectiveness of a spray-applied recombinant NDV vaccine with H5 AIV insert (rNDV-H5) and a recombinant turkey herpesvirus (HVT) vaccine with H5 AIV insert (rHVT-H5) in commercial broilers with MDA to NDV alone (MDA:AIV−NDV+) or to NDV plus AIV (MDA:AIV+NDV+) to provide protection against homologous HPAIV challenge. In Experiment 1, chicks were spray-vaccinated with rNDV-H5 at 3 weeks (3w) and challenged at 5 weeks (5w). All sham-vaccinated progeny lacked AIV antibodies and died following challenge. In rNDV-H5 vaccine groups, AIV and NDV MDA had completely declined to non-detectable levels by vaccination, enabling rNDV-H5 spray vaccine to elicit a protective AIV antibody response by 5w, with 70–78% survival and significant reduction of virus shedding compared to shams. In Experiment 2, progeny were vaccinated with rHVT-H5 and rNDV-H5 at 1 day (1d) or 3w and challenged at 5w. All sham-vaccinated progeny lacked AIV antibodies and died following challenge. In rHVT-H5(1d) vaccine groups, irrespective of rNDV-H5(3w) boost, AIV antibodies reached protective levels pre-challenge, as all progeny survived and virus shedding significantly decreased compared to shams. In contrast, rNDV-H5-vaccinated progeny had AIV and/or NDV MDA at the time of vaccination (1d and/or 3w) and failed to develop a protective immune response by 5w, resulting in 100% mortality after challenge. Our results demonstrate that MDA to AIV had minimal impact on the effectiveness of rHVT-H5, but MDA to AIV and/or NDV at the time of vaccination can prevent development of protective immunity from a primary or booster rNDV-H5 vaccine. © 2018",2018

In December 2014, an H5N8 HPAI clade 2.3.4.4 Group A (2.3.4.4A) virus was introduced to North America. Long-distance migratory wild aquatic birds between East Asia and North America, such as Northern Pintail (Anas acuta), were strongly suspected of being a source of intercontinental transmission. In this study, we evaluated the pathogenicity, infectivity and transmissibility of an H5N8 HPAI clade 2.3.4.4A virus in Northern Pintails and compared the results to that of an H5N1 HPAI clade 2.3.2.1 virus. All of Northern Pintails infected with either H5N1 or H5N8 virus lacked clinical signs and mortality, but the H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 virus was more efficient at replicating within and transmitting between Northern Pintails than the H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1 virus. The H5N8-infected birds shed high titre of viruses from oropharynx and cloaca, which in the field supported virus transmission and spread. This study highlights the role of wild waterfowl in the intercontinental spread of some HPAI viruses. Migratory aquatic birds should be carefully monitored for the early detection of H5 clade 2.3.4.4 and other HPAI viruses. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2018

Subsequent surveillance detected the low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus precursor in multiple broiler breeder farms and backyard poultry in Tennessee and neighboring states. The pathogenesis of the H7N9 LPAI virus was investigated in commercial broiler breeders, the bird type mostly affected in this outbreak. Infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenesis of the H7N9 HPAI and LPAI viruses were also studied in 4-week-old specific pathogen free (SPF) leghorn chickens. The mean bird infectious doses (BID50) for the LPAI isolate was 5.6 log10 mean egg infectious dose (EID50) for broiler breeders and 4.3 log10 EID50 for SPF layer chickens, and no transmission to contact-exposed birds was observed. In both bird types, virus shedding was almost exclusively from the oropharyngeal route. These findings suggest sub-optimal adaptation for sustained transmission with the H7N9 LPAI isolate, indicating that factors other than the birds genetic background may explain the epidemiology of the outbreak. The BID50 for the HPAI isolate in SPF layer chickens was more than 2 logs lower (&lt;2 log10 EID50) than the LPAI isolate. Also, the HPAI virus was shed by both the oropharyngeal and cloacal routes and transmitted to contacts. Greater susceptibility and easier transmission of the H7N9 HPAI virus are features of the HP phenotype that could favor the spread of HPAI over LPAI viruses during outbreaks. © 2018 The Author(s).",2018

The objective of this study was to examine differences in microRNA expression profiles derived from the lungs of beagle dogs infected with the avian-origin H3N2 canine influenza virus (CIV) or the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus (canine-origin isolation strain). After dogs were infected with H3N2 or H5N1, microRNA expression in the lungs was assessed using a deep-sequencing approach. To identify the roles of microRNAs in viral pathogenicity and the host immune response, microRNA target genes were predicted, and their functions were analyzed using bioinformatics software. A total of 229 microRNAs were upregulated in the H5N1 infection group compared with those in the H3N2 infection group, and 166 microRNAs were downregulated. MicroRNA target genes in the H5N1 group were more significantly involved in metabolic pathways, such as glycerolipid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism, than those in the H3N2 group.

Wild waterfowl play a major role in the maintenance and transmission of HPAI. Highly pathogenic avian influenza subtype H5N6 and H5N8 viruses simultaneously emerged in South Korea. In this study, the comparative pathogenicity and infectivity of Clade 2.3.4.4 Group B H5N8 and Group C H5N6 viruses were evaluated in Mandarin duck (Aix galericulata). None of the ducks infected with H5N6 or H5N8 viruses showed clinical signs or mortality. Serological assays revealed that the HA antigenicity of H5N8 and H5N6 viruses was similar to each other. Moreover, both the viruses did not replicate after cross-challenging with H5N8 and H5N6 viruses, respectively, as the second infection. Although both the viruses replicated in most of the internal organs of the ducks, viral replication and shedding through cloaca were higher in H5N8-infected ducks than in H5N6-infected ducks. The findings of this study provide preliminary information to help estimate the risks involved in further evolution and dissemination of Clade 2.3.4.4 HPAI viruses among wild birds. © 2017 The Authors.

Being enzootic in domestic poultry, Egyptian isolates are continuously evolving, and novel clades vary in their pathogenicity in avian hosts. Considering the importance of domestic ducks as natural hosts of HPAI H5N1 viruses and their likelihood of physical contact with other avian hosts and humans, it is of utmost importance to characterize the pathogenicity of newly emerged HPAI strains in the domestic duck. The most recently identified Egyptian clade 2.2.1.2 HPAI H5N1 viruses have been isolated from naturally infected pigeons, turkeys and humans. However, essentially nothing is known about their pathogenicity in domestic ducks. We therefore characterized the pathogenicity of an Egyptian HPAI H5N1 isolate A/chicken/Faquos/amn12/2011 (clade 2.2.1.2) in Sudani duck, a domestic duck breed commonly reared in Egypt. While viral transcription (HA mRNA) was highest in lung, heart and kidney peaking between 40 and 48 hpi, lower levels were detected in brain. Weight loss of infected ducks started at 16 hpi and persisted until 120 hpi. The first severe clinical signs were noted by 32 hpi and peaked in severity at 72 and 96 hpi. Haematological analyses showed a decline in total leucocytes, granulocytes, platelets and granulocyte/lymphocyte ratio, but lymphocytosis. Upon necropsy, lesions were obvious in heart, liver, spleen and pancreas and consisted mainly of necrosis and petechial haemorrhage. Histologically, lungs were the most severely affected organs, whereas brain only showed mild neuronal degeneration and gliosis at 48 hpi despite obvious neurological clinical signs. Taken together, our results provide first evidence that this HPAI H5N1 isolate (clade 2.2.1.2) is highly pathogenic to Sudani ducks and highlight the importance of this breed as potential reservoir and disseminator of HPAI strains from this clade. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2018

In this study, the duck IFN-α gene was cloned, expressed, and purified. The antiviral effects of the resulting rDuIFN-α were further evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that rDuIFN-α inhibited the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and AIV in duck embryo fibroblasts in vitro, with antiviral activities against VSV and AIV of 2.1 × 105 and 4.1 × 105 U/mg, respectively. We next investigated the anti-H5N1 AIV effect of intramuscular injection of rDuIFN-α in vivo. rDuIFN-α reduced viral titers in the brains, lungs, and spleens of 2-day-old (2D) ducks compared with that in the virus-challenged control group, and pretreatment with rDuIFN-α reduced mortality from 60% to 10% in 2D ducks. Moreover, rDuIFN-α increased the expression of IFN-stimulated genes in the brains and spleens of 2D ducks.

Although the causes are multifactorial and complex, one contributing factor may be prior infection with immunosuppressive viruses. In an effort to evaluate the role of immunosuppressive agents on AIV pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy, the effect of prior infection with infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a ubiquitous immunosuppressive virus of chickens, was evaluated. Specific-pathogen-free white Plymouth Rock chickens were exposed to variant E IBDV at 1 day of age and were subsequently vaccinated with an inactivated H7 AIV vaccine 2 wk later. Vaccinated chickens exposed to IBDV had a geometric mean antibody titer to AIV of 1:1.7 by hemagglutination inhibition assay compared to a geometric mean titer of 1:47.5 from chickens that were vaccinated but not exposed to IBDV. Three weeks postvaccination, the chickens were challenged with one of six different doses of highly pathogenic (HP) AIV homologous to the vaccine. Within challenge virus dose groups, vaccinated chickens exposed to IBDV had similar mortality rates to nonvaccinated chickens that were not exposed to IBDV. In contrast, vaccinated chickens that were not exposed to IBDV were protected from mortality. Exposure to IBDV also decreased the mean death time (2.3-3.7 days depending on dose) compared with vaccinated birds not exposed to IBDV (4-7 days depending on dose). Neither vaccination nor IBDV infection had an effect on mean bird infection dose with HPAIV, but the 50% bird lethal dose was reduced from &gt;106 50% egg infective dose (EID50) in the vaccinated, IBDV-nonexposed group to 103.3 EID50 in the vaccinated group exposed to IBDV.

Export of poultry products, such as chicken and duck meat, is a known source for the cross-boundary spread of HPAI H5N1 viruses. Humans get infected with HPAI H5N1 viruses either by close contact with infected poultry or through consumption of fresh/undercooked poultry meat. Skeletal muscle is the largest soft tissue in chicken that has been shown to contain virus during systemic HPAIV infection and supports productive virus infection. However, the time between infection of a chicken with H5N1 virus and presence of virus in muscle tissue is not yet known. Further, it is also not clear whether chicken infected with low doses of H5N1 virus that cause non-fatal subclinical infections continue to accumulate virus in skeletal muscle. We investigated the amount and duration of virus detection in skeletal muscle of chicken experimentally infected with different doses (102, 103 and 104 EID50) of a HPAI H5N1 virus. Influenza viral antigen could be detected as early as 6 hr after infection and live virus was recovered from 48 hr after infection. Notably, chicken infected with lower levels of HPAI H5N1 virus (i.e., 102 EID50) did not die acutely, but continued to accumulate high levels of H5N1 virus in skeletal muscle until 6 days post-infection. Our data suggest that there is a potential risk of human exposure to H5N1 virus through meat from clinically healthy chicken infected with a low dose of virus. Our results highlight the need to implement rigorous monitoring systems to screen poultry meat from H5N1 endemic countries to limit the global spread of H5N1 viruses. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2018

Extensive control efforts have not eradicated them. Vaccination prevents such viruses infecting poultry and reduces the number lost to compulsory slaughter. The study showed the efficacy of inactivated H5 vaccine from the H5N8 virus against highly pathogenic H5N8 and H5N6 avian influenza viruses in chickens. Material and Methods: Reverse genetics constructed an H5 vaccine virus using the HA gene of the 2014 H5N8 avian influenza virus and the rest of the genes from A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). The vaccine viruses were grown in fertilised eggs, partially purified through a sucrose gradient, and inactivated with formalin. Chickens were immunised i.m. with 1 µg of oil-adjuvanted inactivated H5 antigens. Results: Single dose H5 vaccine recipients were completely protected from lethal infections by homologous H5N8 avian influenza virus and shed no virus from the respiratory or intestinal tracts but were not protected from lethal infections by heterologous H5N6. When chickens were immunised with two doses and challenged with homologous H5N8 or heterologous H5N6, all survived and shed no virus. Conclusion: Our results indicate that two-dose immunisations of chickens with H5 antigens with oil adjuvant are needed to provide broad protection against different highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza viruses. © 2018 M.

A novel H7N9 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) variant possessing multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein was first reported in two cases of human infection in January 2017. More seriously, those novel H7N9 HPAIV variants have been transmitted and caused outbreaks on poultry farms in eight provinces in China. Herein, we demonstrate the presence of three different amino acid motifs at the cleavage sites of these HPAIV variants which were isolated from chickens and humans and likely evolved from the preexisting LPAIVs. Animal experiments showed that these novel H7N9 HPAIV variants are both highly pathogenic in chickens and lethal to mice. Notably, humanorigin viruses were more pathogenic in mice than avian viruses, and the mutations in the PB2 gene associated with adaptation to mammals (E627K, A588V, and D701N) were identified by next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing of the isolates from infected mice. No polymorphisms in the key amino acid substitutions of PB2 and HA in isolates from infected chicken lungs were detected by NGS. In sum, these results highlight the high degree of pathogenicity and the valid transmissibility of this new H7N9 variant in chickens and the quick adaptation of this new H7N9 variant to mammals, so the risk should be evaluated and more attention should be paid to this variant. © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.",2018

Efficacy of a recombinant HVTAI (H5) vaccine (rHVT-H5) to provide clinical protection as well as to significantly reduce the shedding of an H5N8 challenge virus has already been demonstrated in SPF chickens. The aim of our studies was to test the efficacy of the same rHVT-H5 vaccine in controlling the transmission of a recent Hungarian HPAIV H5N8 challenge virus in commercial chickens. Broilers and layers were vaccinated at day old according to the manufacturer's recommendation and then challenged with a 2017 Hungarian HPAIV H5N8 (2.3.4.4b) isolate at 5 or 7 weeks of age, respectively. Evaluation of clinical protection, reduction of challenge virus shedding, and transmission to vaccinated contact birds was done on the basis of clinical signs/mortality, detection, and quantitation of challenge virus in oronasal and cloacal swabs (regularly between 1 and 14 days postchallenge). Measurement of seroconversion to AIV nucleoprotein was used as an indicator of infection and replication of challenge virus. Our results demonstrated that rHVT-H5 vaccination could prevent the development of clinical disease and suppress shedding very efficiently, resulting in the lack of challenge virus transmission to vaccinated contact chickens, regardless the type of birds. Single immunization with the tested rHVT-H5 vaccine proved to be effective to stop HPAIV H5N8 (2.3.4.4b) transmission within vaccinated poultry population under experimental conditions.

Virus transmission and pathologic changes in HPAI clade 1.1.2 (H5N1)-, 2.3.2.1c (H5N1)- and 2.3.4.4 (H5N6)-infected dogs were investigated. Mild respiratory signs and antibody response were shown in dogs intranasally infected with the viruses. Lung histopathology showed lesions that were associated with moderate interstitial pneumonia in the infected dogs. In this study, HPAI H5N6 virus replication in dogs was demonstrated for the first time. Dogs have been suspected as a “mixing vessel” for reassortments between avian and human influenza viruses to occur. The replication of these three subtypes of the H5 lineage of HPAI viruses in dogs suggests that dogs could serve as intermediate hosts for avian–human influenza virus reassortment if they are also co-infected with human influenza viruses. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2017

Clade 2.3.4.4 represents a genetic cluster within the Asian HPAIV H5 Goose/Guangdong lineage that has transmitted through migratory birds and spread throughout the world. In 2014, clade 2.3.4.4 strains entered the U.S. via the Pacific flyway, reassorted with local strains of the North American lineage, and produced novel HPAIV strains of the H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8 subtypes. By 2015, the H5N2 HPAIVs disseminated eastwards within the continental U.S. and Canada and infected commercial poultry, causing the largest animal health outbreak in recent history in the U.S. The outbreak was controlled by traditional mass depopulation methods, but the outbreak was of such magnitude that it led to the consideration of alternative control measures, including vaccination. In this regard, little information is available on the long-term protection of turkeys vaccinated against avian influenza. In this report, a vaccination study was carried out in turkeys using 3 prime-boost approaches with a combination of 2 different vaccines, an alphavirus-based replicon vaccine and an adjuvanted-inactivated reverse genetics vaccine. Vaccine efficacy was assessed at 6 and 16 weeks of age following challenge with a prototypic novel clade 2.3.4.4 H5N2 HPAIV. All three vaccines protocols were protective with significantly reduced virus shedding and mortality after challenge at 6 weeks of age. In contrast, significant variations were seen in 16-week old turkeys after challenge: priming with the alphavirus-based replicon followed by boost with the adjuvanted-inactivated vaccine conferred the best protection, whereas the alphavirus-based replicon vaccine given twice provided the least protection. Our study highlights the importance of studying not only different vaccine platforms but also vaccination strategies to maximize protection against HPAIV especially with regards to the longevity of vaccine-induced immune response. © 2017 The Author(s)",2017

Historically, surveillance and research efforts for AIV in waterfowl have focused on dabbling ducks. The role of diving ducks in AIV ecology has not been well characterized. In this study, we examined the relative susceptibility and pathogenicity of clade 2.3.4.4 H5 highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) in two species of diving ducks. Juvenile and adult Ruddy Duck (Oxyura jamaicensis) and juvenile Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) were intranasally inoculated with A/Northern Pintail/WA/40964/2014 H5N2 HPAIV. Additional groups of juvenile Lesser Scaups were inoculated with A/Gyrfalcon/WA/41088/2014 H5N8 HPAIV. The approximate 50% bird infectious doses (BID50) of the H5N2 isolate for adult Ruddy Ducks was &lt;102 50% egg infectious doses (EID50) and for the juvenile Lesser Scaups it was &lt;104 EID50. There were insufficient juvenile Ruddy Ducks to calculate the BID50. The BID50 for the juvenile Lesser Scaups inoculated with the H5N8 isolate was 103 EID50. Clinical disease was not observed in any group; however, mortality occurred in the juvenile Ruddy Ducks inoculated with the H5N2 virus (three of five ducks), and staining for AIV antigen was observed in numerous tissues from these ducks. One adult Ruddy Duck also died and although it was infected with AIV (the duck was positive for virus shedding and AIV antigen was detected in tissues), it was also infected with coccidiosis. The proportion of ducks shedding virus was related to the dose administered, but the titers were similar among dose groups. The group with the fewest ducks shedding virus was the adult Ruddy Ducks. There was a trend for the Lesser Scaups to shed higher titers of virus than the Ruddy Ducks. No virus shedding was detected after 7 d postinoculation in any group. Similar to dabbling ducks, Lesser Scaups and Ruddy Ducks are susceptible to infection with this H5 HPAIV lineage, although they excrete lower titers of virus. © Wildlife Disease Association 2017.",2017

Two vaccines were examined, derived from H5N1 AI virus strains A/Ck/WJava/Sukabumi/006/2008 and A/Ck/CJava/Karanganyar/051/2009. Transmission experiments were carried out in four vaccine and two control groups, with six sets of 16 specified pathogen free (SPF) layer chickens. Birds were vaccinated at 4 weeks of age with one strain and challenge-infected with the homologous or heterologous strain at 8 weeks of age. No transmission or virus shedding occurred in groups challenged with the homologous strain. In the group vaccinated with the Karanganyar strain, high cross-HI responses were observed, and no transmission of the Sukabumi strain occurred. However, in the group vaccinated with the Sukabumi strain, cross-HI titres were low, virus shedding was not reduced, and multiple transmissions to contact birds were observed. This study showed large differences in cross-protection of two vaccines based on two different highly pathogenic H5N1 virus strains. This implies that extrapolation of in vitro data to clinical protection and reduction of virus transmission might not be straightforward. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017

The virus exhibited high pathogenicity and a high replication capacity in chickens, whereas virus growth was slightly lower in ducks compared with that of an H5N8 HPAIV isolate collected in Japan in 2014. Comprehensive analyses of Japanese isolates, including those from central, western, and southern Japan, as well as rapid publication of this information are essential for facilitating greater control of HPAIVs. © 2017 The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",2017

Soon after the epizootic began, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) began testing the efficacy of different vaccines as a possible future control strategy. The aim of these studies were to evaluate the efficacy three H5 vaccines to aid in control of HPAI in commercial turkeys. Three different vaccine technologies were evaluated for efficacy: 1) inactivated reverse genetic laboratory-generated virus encoding a clade 2.3.4.4 H5 hemagglutinin (HA) gene (rgH5), 2) recombinant turkey herpesvirus encoding a clade 2.2. H5 HA (rHVT-AI), and 3) recombinant replication-deficient alphavirus RNA particle vaccine encoding a clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HA (RP-H5). All vaccines tested significantly (P < 0.01) increased survival rates between vaccinated and sham vaccinated groups of poults challenged with A/turkey/Minnesota/12582/2015 clade 2.3.4.4 H5N2 HPAI. The rgH5 vaccine had detectable serum hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody against the challenge virus, and significantly reduced the frequency and level of viral shedding from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs at days 2 and 4 post-challenge. Vaccination with only rHVT-AI or RP-H5 was not 100% protective, and failed to significantly reduce viral shedding post-challenge. A combined prime and boost strategy with the rHVT-AI and RP-H5, or rHVT-AI and rgH5, was 100% protective against lethal H5N2 HPAI challenge. Results of these studies led to USDA conditional approval of commercially available recombinant vaccines for use in turkeys as a control measure for clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAI epizootics. © 2017",2017

Objectives: Assess the susceptibility of pigs to HPAI H5N1, H5N2, and H5N8 clade 2.3.3.3 from North America. Methods: Pigs and trachea explants were inoculated with a representative panel of H5NX clade 2.3.4.4 HPAI viruses from North America. Nasal swabs, BALF, and sera were collected to assess replication and transmission in challenged and direct contact pigs by RRT-PCR, virus isolation, hemagglutination inhibition, and ELISA. Results: Limited virus replication was restricted to the lower respiratory tract of challenged pigs, though absent in the nasal passages and trachea cultures, as determined by RRT-PCR in all samples. Seroconversion of inoculated pigs was detected by NP ELISA but was not reliably detected by antigen-specific hemagglutination inhibition. Boost with adjuvanted virus was required for the production of neutralizing antibodies to assess cross-reactivity between wild-type avian strains. All RRT-PCR and serology tests were negative for contact animals indicating a failure of transmission from primary inoculated pigs. Conclusions: H5NX clade 2.3.4.4 strains can replicate in the lower respiratory tract of swine upon high titer inoculation, though appear to be incapable of replication in swine nasal epithelium in vivo or ex vivo in trachea explants in culture. Infected pigs did not produce high levels of serum antibodies following infection. Collectively, our data show HPAI H5NX clade 2.3.4.4 viruses to be poorly adapted for replication and transmission in swine. © 2017 The Authors.

The carcass or tissues derived from infected birds may present the risk of the virus spreading to humans, animals, and the surrounding environment. In this study, we investigated the survival of the virus in feather, muscle, and liver tissues collected from six chickens (Gallus gallus) experimentally infected with HPAI H5N1 virus. The tissues were stored at +4°C or +20°C, and viral isolation was performed at different times for 360 days. The maximum periods for viral survival were observed in samples stored at +4°C in all tissue types and were 240 days in feather tissues, 160 days in muscle, and 20 days in liver. The viral infectivity at +20°C was maintained for a maximum of 30 days in the feather tissues, 20 days in muscle, and 3 days in liver. The viral inactivation rates partly overlapped in the feather and muscle tissues at the two temperatures. The virus was inactivated rapidly in the liver. Our experimental results indicate that the tissue type and temperature can greatly influence the survival of HPAI H5N1 virus in the tissues of infected chickens. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.",2017

Rapid and accurate diagnosis is one of the key strategies for the control of H5 HPAIVs. However, the sensitivity of the diagnosis of H5 HPAIVs has gradually reduced due to extensive antigenic variation during their evolution. Particularly, the previously developed immunochromatographic diagnosis kit for H5 viruses, Linjudge Flu A/H5, exhibits reduced detection of H5 HPAIVs isolated in recent years. In the present study, we established a new advanced H5 rapid immunochromatographic detection kit (New Linjudge Flu A/H5) by a combination of two anti-H5 hemagglutinin monoclonal antibodies, A64/1 previously applied in the Linjudge Flu A/H5 and A32/2, a novel monoclonal antibody generated from a clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIV. The new kit broadly detected all classical and recent H5 influenza viruses and showed a higher specificity and sensitivity than the original Linjudge Flu A/H5 with recently circulating H5 HPAIVs. Furthermore, the applicability of the New Linjudge Flu A/H5 was demonstrated by detecting antigens from the swabs and tissue homogenates of naturally infected birds and experimentally infected chickens with H5N6 HPAIVs belonging to the genetic clade 2.3.4.4. Our study, therefore, can provide an effective point-of-care rapid antigen detection kit for the surveillance of H5 avian influenza viruses and as a prompt countermeasure against the current widespread of the clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIVs in domestic and wild birds. © 2017 Nguyen et al.

Based on whole-genome sequences, we divided the viruses into four genotypes. The DKE26, GSE43, and DKE53 viruses belonged to Genotypes 1–3, respectively. The CKE93 and CKE96 viruses were classified into Genotype 4. Genotypes 1–3 correspond to the viruses containing the HA gene of clade 2.3.2, and Genotype 4 is the virus that bears the HA gene of clade 7.2. To better understand the pathogenicity and transmission of the viruses, we infected chickens with 103 EID50 /0.1 ml GSE43 (clade 2.3.2) or CKE93 (clade 7.2) virus. Our results revealed that 6 of 7 specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens inoculated with GSE43 virus were dead before 7-day post-infection, but all the SPF chickens inoculated with CKE93 virus survived the infection. Both the GSE43 and CKE93 viruses replicated systemically in chickens. The virus titers of GSE43 virus in tested organs were obviously higher than those of CKE93 virus. Our results revealed that the pathogenicity and replication of GSE43 in chickens was much higher than those of CKE93. The GSE43 virus could transmit between chickens, but the CKE93 could not transmit between chickens by naïve contact. Therefore, different clades of H5N1 AIVs possessed variable pathogenicities and transmission abilities among chickens.

Vaccination is utilized as a component of control programs for both high pathogenicity (HP) and low pathogenicity (LP) AIV. Over 95% of all AIV vaccine used in poultry are inactivated, adjuvanted products. To identify the best formulations for chickens, vaccines were prepared with beta-propiolactone (BPL) inactivated A/British Columbia/314514-1/2004 H7N3 LP AIV using ten commercially available or experimental adjuvants. Each vaccine formulation was evaluated for immunogenicity in chickens. Challenge studies with an antigenically homologous strain of HPAIV were conducted to compare protection against mortality and measure reductions in virus levels in oral swabs. The four best adjuvants from the studies with BPL inactivated antigen were selected and tested identically, but with vaccines prepared from formalin inactivated virus. Mineral and vegetable oil based adjuvants generally induced the highest antibody titers with 100% seroconversion by 3 weeks post vaccination. Chitosan induced positive antibody titers in 100% of the chickens, but the titers were significantly lower than those of most of the oil based adjuvants. Antibody levels from calcium phosphate and alginate adjuvanted groups were similar to those of non-adjuvanted virus. All groups that received adjuvanted vaccines induced similar levels of protection against mortality (0–20%) except the groups vaccinated with calcium phosphate adjuvanted vaccines, where mortality was similar (70%) to groups that received non-adjuvanted inactivated virus or no vaccine (60–100% mortality). Virus shedding in oral swabs was variable among the treatment groups. Formalin inactivated vaccine induced similar antibody titers and protection against challenge compared to BPL inactivated vaccine groups. These studies support the use of oil adjuvanted vaccines for use in the poultry industry for control for AIV. © 2017",2017

Since domestic waterfowl are common backyard poultry frequently in contact with wild waterfowl, the infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity of the United States H5 HPAI index viruses (H5N8 and H5N2) was investigated in domestic ducks and geese. Ducks infected with the viruses had an increase in body temperature but no or mild clinical signs. Infected geese did not show increase in body temperature and most only had mild clinical signs; however, some geese presented severe neurological signs. Ducks became infected and transmitted the viruses to contacts when inoculated with high virus doses [(104 and 106 50% embryo infective dose (EID50)], but not with a lower dose (102 EID50). Geese inoculated with the H5N8 virus became infected regardless of the virus dose given, and transmitted the virus to direct contacts. Only geese inoculated with the higher doses of the H5N2 and their contacts became infected, indicating differences in infectivity between the two viruses and the two waterfowl species. Geese shed higher titers of virus and for a longer period of time than ducks. In conclusion, the H5 HPAI viruses can infect domestic waterfowl and easily transmit to contact birds, with geese being more susceptible to infection and disease than ducks. The disease is mostly asymptomatic, but infected birds shed virus for several days representing a risk to other poultry species. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017

However, currently available inactivated influenza vaccines are less efficacious against viruses that display antigenic drift. In this study, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus (BV-HMNN) expressing four conserved antigen epitopes: H5N1 hemagglutinin stem area amino acids 76–130 (HA2 76–130); three tandem repeats from the ectodomain of the conserved influenza matrix protein M2 (3M2e); nucleoprotein amino acids 55–69 (NP55–69); and nucleoprotein amino acids 380–393 (NP380–393). We evaluated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of coimmunization with an inactivated avian influenza virus vaccine (Re6) and the recombinant baculovirus (BV-HMNN) against heterologous viral infection in specific-pathogen-free chickens. The chickens immunized with both vaccines (Re6 + BV-HMNN) achieved complete protection, was significantly greater than that of chickens vaccinated with Re6 alone. BV-HMNN-supplemented vaccination also reduced viral shedding more effectively than nonsupplemented vaccination. We conclude that coimmunization with both vaccines was superior to immunization with the inactivated vaccine alone in inducing cross-protection against heterologous H5N1 virus. © 2017",2017

An H5 antigen encoded by a recombinant baculovirus and expressed in insect cells was used for oil-emulsion-based vaccine prototypes. In several experiments, vaccination was performed at 10 days of age, followed by challenge infection on day 21 post vaccination (PV) with HPAI-H5N1 clades 2.2, 2.2.1, and 2.3.2. A further challenge infection with HPAI-H5N1 clade 2.2.1 was performed at day 42 PV. High haemagglutination inhibition titres were observed for the recH5 vaccine antigen, and lower haemagglutination inhibition titres for the challenge virus antigens. Nevertheless, the rate of protection from mortality and clinical signs was 100% when challenged at 21 days PV and 42 days PV, indicating protection over the entire broiler chicken rearing period without a second vaccination. The unvaccinated control chickens mostly died between two and five days after challenge infection. A low level of viral RNA was detected by reverse transcription followed by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction in a limited number of birds for a short period after challenge infection, indicating a limited spread of HPAI-H5N1 at flock level. Furthermore, it was observed that the vaccine can be used in a differentiation infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) approach, based on the detection of nucleoprotein antibodies in vaccinated/challenged chickens. The vaccine fulfilled all expectations of an inactivated vaccine after one vaccination against challenge with different clades of H5N1-HPAI and is suitable for a DIVA approach. © 2017 Houghton Trust Ltd.",2017

These viruses, which were reported to be highly virulent in chickens by intravenous inoculation, have a consensus HPAI motif PLRERRRKR at the HA cleavage site. However, two-clade 2.3.4.4 H5N8 viruses which we isolated from wild migratory birds in late 2014 in Japan possessed atypical HA cleavage sequences. A swan isolate, Tottori/C6, had a novel polybasic cleavage sequence, PLGERRRKR, and another isolate from a dead mandarin duck, Gifu/01, had a heterogeneous mixture of consensus PLRERRRKR and variant PLRERRRRKR sequences. The polybasic HA cleavage site is the prime virulence determinant of AIVs. Therefore, in the present study, we examined the pathogenicity of these H5N8 isolates in chickens by intravenous inoculation. When 106 EID50 of these viruses were intravenously inoculated into chickens, the mean death time associated with Tottori/C6 was substantially longer (&gt;6.1 days) than that associated with Gifu/01 (2.5 days). These viruses had comparable abilities to replicate in tissue culture cells in the presence and absence of exogenous trypsin, but the growth of Tottori/C6 was hampered. These results indicate that the novel cleavage motif of Tottori/C6 did not directly affect the infectivity of the virus, but Tottori/C6 caused attenuated pathogenicity in chickens because of hampered replication efficiency. It is important to test for the emergence of diversified HPAIVs, because introduction of HPAIVs with a lower virulence like Tottori/C6 might hinder early detection of affected birds in poultry farms. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",2017

Attempts to obtain effective vaccines against H5N1 HPAIVs have focused on hemagglutinin (HA), an immunodominant viral antigen capable of eliciting neutralizing antibodies. The vast majority of vaccine projects have been performed using eukaryotic expression systems. In contrast, we used a bacterial expression system to produce vaccine HA protein (bacterial HA) according to our own design. The HA protein with the sequence of the H5N1 HPAIV strain was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli, recovered in the form of inclusion bodies and refolded by dilution between two chromatographic purification steps. Antigenicity studies showed that the resulting antigen, referred to as rH5-E. coli, preserves conformational epitopes targeted by antibodies specific for H5-subtype HAs, inhibiting hemagglutination and/or neutralizing influenza viruses in vitro. The proper conformation of this protein and its ability to form functional oligomers were confirmed by a hemagglutination test. Consistent with the biochemical characteristics, prime-boost immunizations with adjuvanted rH5-E. coli protected 100% and 70% of specific pathogen-free, layer-type chickens against challenge with homologous and heterologous H5N1 HPAIVs, respectively. The observed protection was related to the positivity in the FluAC H5 test (IDVet) but not to hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titers. Due to full protection, the effective contact transmission of the homologous challenge virus did not occur. Survivors from both challenges did not or only transiently shed the viruses, as established by viral RNA detection in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs. Our results demonstrate that vaccination with rH5-E. coli could confer control of H5N1 HPAIV infection and transmission rates in chicken flocks, accompanied by reduced virus shedding. © 2017 Saczyńska et al.

Viral replication and shedding were greater in H5N8-infected ducks than in H5N1-infected ducks.

The chimeric H9/H5N2 virus showed in vitro and in vivo growth properties and virulence that were similar to those of the low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H9 virus. An inactivated vaccine based on this chimeric virus induced serum neutralizing (SN) antibodies against both H9 and H5 viruses but induced cross-reactive hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody only against H9 viruses. Thus, this suggests its compatibility for use in the DIVA strategy against H5 strains. Furthermore, the chimeric H9/H5N2 recombinant vaccine protected immunized chickens against lethal challenge by HPAI H5N8 viruses and significantly attenuated virus shedding after infection by both H9N2 and HPAI H5N8 viruses. In mice, serological analyses confirmed that HA1- and HA2 stalk-specific antibody responses were induced by vaccination and that the DIVA principle could be employed through the use of an HI assay against H5 viruses. Furthermore, each HA1- and HA2 stalk-specific antibody response was sufficient to inhibit viral replication and protect the chimeric virusimmunized mice from lethal challenge with both mouse-adapted H9N2 and wild-type HPAI H5N1 viruses, although differences in vaccine efficacy against a homologous H9 virus (HA1 head domain immune-mediated protection) and a heterosubtypic H5 virus (HA2 stalk domain immune-mediated protection) were observed.

In order to examine changes in adaptation of this viral lineage, the infectivity, pathogenicity and transmission of poultry H5N2 viruses were investigated in chickens and mallards in comparison to the wild duck 2014 U.S. index H5N2 virus. The four poultry isolates examined had a lower mean bird infectious dose than the index virus but still transmitted poorly to direct contacts. In mallards, two of the H5N2 poultry isolates had similar high infectivity and transmissibility as the index H5N2 virus, the H5N8 U.S. index virus, and a 2005 H5N1 clade 2.2 virus. Mortality occurred with the H5N1 virus and, interestingly, with one of two poultry H5N2 isolates. Increased virus adaptation to chickens was observed with the poultry H5N2 viruses; however these viruses retained high adaptation to mallards but pathogenicity was differently affected. © 2016",2016

Most cases in commercial poultry were caused by an H5N2 strain which was a reassortant with 5 Eurasian lineage genes, including a clade 2.3.4.4 goose/Guangdong/1996 lineage hemagglutinin, and 3 genes from North American wild waterfowl low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses. The outbreak primarily affected turkeys and table-egg layer type chickens. Three isolates were selected for characterization in turkeys: the US index isolate from December 2014 (A/northern pintail/WA/40964/2014), and two poultry isolates from April 2015 (A/chicken/IA/13388/2015 and A/turkey/MN/12528/2015). Results: Four week old broad-breasted white turkeys were inoculated with one of three doses (102, 104 or 106 50% egg infectious doses [EID50] per bird) of each of the isolates to evaluate infectious dose and pathogenesis. The mean bird infectious dose of A/northern pintail/WA/40964/2014 and A/turkey/MN/12528/2015 was 105 EID50 per bird, but was 103 EID50 per bird for A/chicken/IA/13388/2015, suggesting the latter had greater adaptation to gallinaceous birds. All three isolates had unusually long mean death time of 5.3-5.9 days post challenge, and the primary clinical signs were severe lethargy and neurological signs which started no more than 24 h before death (the average pre-clinical period was 4 days). Infected turkeys also shed high levels of virus by both the oropharyngeal and cloacal routes. Conclusions: The unusually long mean death times, high levels of virus in feces, and increased adaptation of the later viruses may have contributed to the rapid spread of the virus during the peak of the outbreak. © 2016 The Author(s).",2016

Vaccines have been widely used to control these diseases in the poultry industry in endemic countries. However, vaccination policy without differentiating infected animals from vaccinated animals (DIVA) makes the virus surveillance difficult. In this study, we developed a bivalent virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine that is composed of the hemagglutinin (HA) and matrix 1 (M1) proteins of the H5N1 HPAI virus (HPAIV) and a chimeric protein containing the ectodomain of the ND virus (NDV) fusion (F) protein fused with the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of the HPAIV HA protein. A single immunization of chickens with the chimeric VLP vaccine induced high levels of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers against H5N1 HPAI virus and anti-NDV antibody detected in ELISA and protected chickens against subsequent lethal HPAIV and NDV infections. Furthermore, we could easily perform DIVA test using the commercial NP-cELISA tests against HPAIV and HI assay against NDV. These results strongly suggest that utilization of chimeric VLP vaccine in poultry species would be a promising strategy for the better control of HPAI and ND simultaneously. © 2016 Noh et al.

In March 2014, a new reassortant H5N6 subtype highly pathogenic avian influenza virus emerged in Lao People's Democratic Republic.We have assessed the pathogenicity, pathobiology and immunological responses associated with this virus in chickens. Infection caused moderate to advanced disease in 6 of 6 chickens within 48 h of mucosal inoculation. High virus titers were observed in blood and tissues (kidney, spleen, liver, duodenum, heart, brain and lung) taken at euthanasia. Viral antigen was detected in endothelium, neurons, myocardium, lymphoid tissues and other cell types. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated compared to non-infected birds. Our study confirmed that this new H5N6 reassortant is highly pathogenic, causing disease in chickens similar to that of Asian H5N1 viruses, and demonstrated the ability of such clade 2.3.4-originH5 viruses to reassort with non-N1 subtype viruses while maintaining a fit and infectious phenotype. Recent detection of influenza H5N6 poultry infections in Lao PDR, China and Viet Nam, as well as six fatal human infections in China, demonstrate that these emergent highly pathogenic H5N6 viruses may be widely established in several countries and represent an emerging threat to poultry and human populations. © 2016 Butler et al.

Four groups (E1-E4) of SPF chickens (n = 6) prior inoculated with 106 EID50 of H9N2 virus were challenged with 106 EID50 of H5N1 natural reassortant (PB1-H9N2) virus at days 1 (group E1); 3 (group E2); 7 (group E3) and 14 (group E4) post H9N2 inoculation. The survival percentage in groups E1-E4 was 0, 100, 66.6 and 50%, respectively. Virus shedding periods for groups E1-E4 were 3, 4, 7 and 9 days, respectively post H5N1 challenge. Birds of group E1 and E2 were shedding both H9N2 and H5N1 viruses and mean viral RNA copy number was higher in oropharyngeal swabs than cloacal swabs. In group, E3 and E4 birds excreted only H5N1 virus and mean viral RNA copy number was higher in most cloacal swabs than oral swabs. These results indicate that prior infection with H9N2 virus could protect from lethal challenge of reassortant H5N1 virus as early as with three days prior H9N2 inoculation and protection decreased in groups E3 and E4 as time elapsed. However, prior infection with H9N2 did not prevent infection with H5N1 virus and birds continue to excrete virus in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs. Amino acid substitution K368E was found in HA gene of excreted H5N1 virus of group E3. Hence, concurrent infection can also cause emergence of viruses with mutations leading to virus evolution.

These viruses varied in the clinical symptoms they induced, including lethality, virus shedding, and replication in host tissues. A comparison of the host responses in the lung, brain, and spleen suggested that the differences in viral replication efficiency were related to the host cytokine response at the early phase of infection, especially variations in the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. Based on these findings, we inoculated the virus that showed the mildest pathogenicity among the five tested, A/pigeon/Thailand/VSMU-7-NPT/2004, into four breeds of Thai indigenous chicken, Phadu-Hung-Dang (PHD), Chee, Dang, and Luang-Hung-Khao (LHK), to explore effects of genetic background on host response. Among these breeds, Chee, Dang, and LHK showed significantly longer survival times than White Leghorns. Virus shedding from dead Thai indigenous chickens was significantly lower than that from White Leghorns. Although polymorphisms were observed in the Mx and MHC class I genes, there was no significant association between the polymorphisms in these loci and resistance to HPAIV. © 2016 Matsuu et al.

Recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) represent a promising novel vaccine approach to control avian influenza including HPAI strains. Influenza VLPs contain viral hemagglutinin (HA), which can be expressed in cell culture within highly immunogenic VLPs that morphologically and antigenically resemble influenza virions, except VLPs are non-infectious. Here we describe a recombinant VLP containing HA proteins derived from three distinct clades of H5N1 viruses as an experimental, broadly protective H5 avian influenza vaccine. A baculovirus vector was configured to co-express the H5 genes from recent H5N1 HPAI isolates A/chicken/Germany/2014 (clade 2.3.4.4), A/chicken/West Java/Subang/29/2007 (clade 2.1.3) and A/chicken/Egypt/121/2012 (clade 2.2.1). Co-expression of these genes in Sf9 cells along with influenza neuraminidase (NA) and retrovirus gag genes resulted in production of triple-clade H555 VLPs that exhibited hemagglutination activity and morphologically resembled influenza virions. Vaccination of chickens with these VLPs resulted in induction of serum antibody responses and efficient protection against experimental challenges with three different viruses including the recent U.S. H5N8 HPAI isolate. We conclude that these novel triple-clade VLPs represent a feasible strategy for simultaneously evoking protective antibodies against multiple variants of H5 influenza virus. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",2016

The underlying host immune responses counteracting these viruses in chickens remain not well understood. In the present study, the cytokine responses to a classic strain (C121) and those to a variant strain (V1063) were compared in naïve and vaccinated chickens. In naïve chickens, the C121 replicated more efficiently than the V1063. Both the C121 and the V1063 increased interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-10 gene expression at 48 h post inoculation (hpi) in the lung and spleen but the levels of these cytokines were lower in chickens infected with the C121 than those infected with the V1063. In contrast, in chickens vaccinated with inactivated C121-based vaccine, the C121 replicated less than the V1063. Both challenge with the C121 and that with the V1063 did not increase IFN-γ gene expression at 48 hpi; rather, the C121 increased IL-4 gene expression in the lung accompanied with lower viral titer and higher HI titers. These results suggested that the pathogenicity of HPAI viruses correlated with IFN-γ-producing helper and/or cytotoxic T cell responses in naïve chickens, whereas vaccine efficacy to HPAI viruses correlated with IL-4 producing helper T cell responses in the lung in vaccinated chickens. It implies that IL-4 in the lung, in addition to the traditional serum HI titers, could be used to screen novel vaccine strategies, such as strains, adjuvant, prime/boost protocols, against HPAI in chickens. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2016

The matrix 2 protein ectodomain (M2e) is considered a promising candidate for a universal cross-protective influenza vaccine that provides more effective control over HPAI H5 viruses harboring variant hemagglutinin (HA)-antigens. Here, we evaluated the protective efficacy of a tandem repeat construct of heterologous M2e presented on virus-like particles (M2e5x VLPs) either alone or as a supplement against HPAI H5 viruses in a chicken model. Chickens immunized with M2e5x VLPs alone induced M2e-specific antibodies but were not protected against HPAI H5. The homo- and cross-protective efficacy of M2e5x VLP-supplemented vaccination of chickens was also examined. Importantly, supplementation with M2e5x VLPs induced significantly higher levels of antibodies specific for M2e and different viruses as well as provided improved protection against homologous and heterologous HPAI H5 viruses. Considering the limited efficacy of inactivated vaccines, supplement vaccination with M2e5x VLPs may be an effective measure for preventing outbreaks of HPAI viruses that have the ability to constantly change their antigenic properties in poultry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2016

Remarkably, we demonstrate that the effect of antigenic distances between the vaccine and challenge strains used in this study is too small to influence the transmission dynamics of the strains used. This is because the effect of a sufficient vaccine dose on antibody levels against the challenge viruses is large enough to compensate for any decrease in antibody titres due to antigenic differences between vaccine and challenge strains. Our results showthat at least under experimental conditions, vaccination will remain effective even after antigenic changes as may be caused by the initial selection in vaccinated birds. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In recent years, new H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV) still emerged constantly, although all poultry in China were immunized with H5N1 vaccinations compulsorily. To better understand the pathogenicity and transmission of dominant clades of the H5N1 HPAIVs in chicken from Guangdong in 2012, we chose a clade 7.2 avian influenza virus named A/Chicken/China/G2/2012(H5N1) (G2) and a clade 2.3.2.1 avian influenza virus named A/Duck/China/G3/2012(H5N1) (G3) in our study. Our results showed that the chickens inoculated with 103 EID50 of G2 or G3 viruses all died, and the titers of virus replication detected in several visceral organs were high but different. In the naive contact groups, virus shedding was not detected in G2 group and all chickens survived, but virus shedding was detected in G3 group and all chickens died. These results showed that the two clades of H5N1 HPAIVs had high pathogenicity in chickens and the contact transmission of them was different in chickens. The results of cross reactive HI assay showed that antigens of G2 and G3 were very different from those of current commercial vaccines isolates (Re-4, Re-6, and D7). And to evaluate the protective efficacy of three vaccines against most isolates form Guangdong belonging to clade 2.3.2.1 in 2012, G3 was chosen to challenge the three vaccines such as Re-4, Re-6, and D7. First, chickens were immunized with 0.3 ml Re-4, Re-6, and D7 inactivated vaccines by intramuscular injection, respectively, and then challenged with 106 EID50 of G3 on day 28 post-vaccination. The D7 vaccine had 100% protection against G3 for chickens, the Re-6 vaccine had 88.9%, and the Re-4 vaccine only had 66.7%.

In Experiment 1, efficacy of rLemna-HA was tested on birds immunized with 0.2μg or 2.3μg HA and challenged with 106 mean chicken embryo infectious doses (EID50) of homologous virus strain. Both dosages of rLemna-HA conferred clinical protection and dramatically reduced viral shedding. Almost all the birds immunized with either dosage of rLemna-HA elicited HA antibody titers against Indo/03 antigen, suggesting an association between levels of anti-Indo/03 antibodies and protection. In Experiment 2, efficacy of rLemna-HA was tested on birds immunized with 0.9μg or 2.2μg HA and challenged with 106 EID50 of heterologous H5N1 virus strains A/chicken/Vietnam/NCVD-421/2010 (VN/10) or A/chicken/West Java/PWT-WIJ/2006 (PWT/06). Birds challenged with VN/10 exhibited 100% survival regardless of immunization dosage, while birds challenged with PWT/06 had 50% and 30% mortality at 0.9μg HA and 2.2μg HA, respectively. For each challenge virus, viral shedding titers from 2.2μg HA vaccinated birds were significantly lower than those from 0.9μg HA vaccinated birds, and titers from both immunized groups were in turn significantly lower than those from sham vaccinated birds. Even if immunized birds elicited HA titers against the vaccine antigen Indo/03, only the groups challenged with VN/10 developed humoral immunity against the challenge antigen. None (rLemna-HA 0.9μg HA) and 40% (rLemna-HA 2.2μg HA) of the immunized birds challenged with PWT/06 elicited pre-challenge antibody titers, respectively. In conclusion, Lemna-expressed HA demonstrated complete protective immunity against homologous challenge and suboptimal protection against heterologous challenge, the latter being similar to results from inactivated whole virus vaccines. Transgenic duckweed-derived HA could be a good alternative for producing high quality antigen for an injectable vaccine against H5N1 HPAI viruses. © 2015.",2015

In this study we infected domestic ducks with a virulent NDV virus (vNDV) and either a LPAIV or a HPAIV by giving the viruses individually, simultaneously, or sequentially two days apart. No clinical signs were observed in ducks infected or co-infected with vNDV and LPAIV, but co-infection decreased the number of ducks shedding vNDV and the amount of virus shed (P<. 0.01) at 4 days post inoculation (dpi). Co-infection did not affect the number of birds shedding LPAIV, but more LPAIV was shed at 2. dpi (P<. 0.0001) from ducks inoculated with only LPAIV compared to ducks co-infected with vNDV. Ducks that received the HPAIV with the vNDV simultaneously survived fewer days (P<. 0.05) compared to the ducks that received the vNDV two days before the HPAIV. Co-infection also reduced transmission of vNDV to naïve contact ducks housed with the inoculated ducks. In conclusion, domestic ducks can become co-infected with vNDV and LPAIV with no effect on clinical signs but with reduction of virus shedding and transmission.

For field use, the overwhelming majority of AI vaccines produced are inactivated whole virus formulated into an oil emulsion. However, recombinant vectored vaccines are gaining use for their ability to induce protection against heterologous isolates and ability to overcome maternal antibody interference. In these studies, we compared protection of chickens provided by a turkey herpesvirus (HVT) vector vaccine expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from a clade 2.2 H5N1 strain (A/swan/Hungary/4999/2006) against homologous H5N1 as well as heterologous H5N1 and H5N2 highly pathogenic (HP) AI challenge. The results demonstrated all vaccinated birds were protected from clinical signs of disease and mortality following homologous challenge. In addition, oral and cloacal swabs taken from challenged birds demonstrated that vaccinated birds had lower incidence and titers of viral shedding compared to sham-vaccinated birds. Following heterologous H5N1 or H5N2 HPAI challenge, 80-95% of birds receiving the HVT vector AI vaccine at day of age survived challenge with fewer birds shedding virus after challenge than sham vaccinated birds. In vitro cytotoxicity analysis demonstrated that splenic T lymphocytes from HVT-vector-AI vaccinated chickens recognized MHC-matched target cells infected with H5, as well as H6, H7, or H9 AI virus. Taken together, these studies provide support for the use of HVT vector vaccines expressing HA to protect poultry against multiple lineages of HPAI, and that both humoral and cellular immunity induced by live vaccines likely contributes to protection. © 2015 .",2015

To investigate whether the pathogenicity of a clade 2.3.2 virus was lower than that of clades previously occurring in free-living wild birds in Europe, four tufted ducks were inoculated with influenza A/duck/HongKong/1091/2011 (H5N1) clade 2.3.2 virus. The ducks were monitored and sampled for virus excretion daily during 4 days, followed by pathologic, immunohistochemical, and virological investigations. The virus produced severe disease as evidenced by clinical signs, presence of marked lesions and abundant viral antigen in several tissues, especially the central nervous system. The study shows that HPAI-H5N1 virus clade 2.3.2 is highly pathogenic for tufted ducks and thus, they are unlikely to maintain this clade in the free-living population or serve as long-distance vectors. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2015

H5N1 HPAI was first reported in Indonesia in 2003, and vaccination was initiated in 2004, but reports of vaccine failures began to emerge in mid-2005. This study investigated the role of Indonesian licensed vaccines, specific vaccine seed strains, and emerging variant field viruses as causes of vaccine failures. Eleven of 14 licensed vaccines contained the manufacturer's listed vaccine seed strains, but 3 vaccines contained a seed strain different from that listed on the label. Vaccines containing A/turkey/Wisconsin/ 1968 (WI/68), A/chicken/Mexico/28159-232/1994 (Mex/94), and A/turkey/England/N28/1973 seed strains had high serological potency in chickens (geometric mean hemagglutination inhibition [HI] titers, ≥1:169), but vaccines containing strain A/chicken/Guangdong/1/1996 generated by reverse genetics (rg; rgGD/96), A/chicken/Legok/2003 (Legok/03), A/chicken/Vietnam/ C57/2004 generated by rg (rgVN/04), or A/chicken/Legok/2003 generated by rg (rgLegok/03) had lower serological potency (geometric mean HI titers, ≤1:95). In challenge studies, chickens immunized with any of the H5 avian influenza vaccines were protected against A/chicken/West Java/SMI-HAMD/2006 (SMI-HAMD/06) and were partially protected against A/chicken/Papua/ TA5/2006 (Papua/06) but were not protected against A/chicken/West Java/PWT-WIJ/2006 (PWT/06). Experimental inactivated vaccines made with PWT/06 HPAI virus or rg-generated PWT/06 low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) virus seed strains protected chickens from lethal challenge, as did a combination of a commercially available live fowl poxvirus vaccine expressing the H5 influenza virus gene and inactivated Legok/03 vaccine. These studies indicate that antigenic variants did emerge in Indonesia following widespread H5 avian influenza vaccine usage, and efficacious inactivated vaccines can be developed using antigenic variant wild-type viruses or rg-generated LPAI virus seed strains containing the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes of wild-type viruses. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.",2015

However, the mechanism used by IAV to invade the brain has not been determined. In the current work, we used chickens infected with a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus as a model to elucidate the mechanism of entry of IAV into the brain. The permeability of the BBB was evaluated in fifteen-day-old H7N1-infected and non-infected chickens using three different methods: (i) detecting Evans blue (EB) extravasation into the brain, (ii) determining the leakage of the serum protein immunoglobulin Y (IgY) into the brain and (iii) assessing the stability of the tight-junction (TJ) proteins zonula occludens-1 and claudin-1 in the chicken brain at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 hours post-inoculation (hpi). The onset of the induced viremia was evaluated by quantitative real time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) at the same time points. Viral RNA was detected from 18 hpi onward in blood samples, whereas IAV antigen was detected at 24 hpi in brain tissue samples. EB and IgY extravasation and loss of integrity of the TJs associated with the presence of viral antigen was first observed at 36 and 48 hpi in the telencephalic pallium and cerebellum. Our data suggest that the mechanism of entry of the H7N1 HPAI into the brain includes infection of the endothelial cells at early stages (24 hpi) with subsequent disruption of the TJs of the BBB and leakage of virus and serum proteins into the adjacent neuroparenchyma. © 2014 Chaves et al.",2014

In naïve poultry, primarily gallinaceous birds, the virus induces fatal disease and the used inactivated vaccines occasionally are unable to provide efficient and early onset of protection. Therefore, optimized vaccines must be developed and evaluated in model systems. In our study, we tested a novel H5 neuraminidase-deleted influenza A virus variant to analyze the induction of a very early onset of immunity. Ferrets, mice and chickens were each immunized with a single vaccine dose seven, three and one day before lethal challenge infection, respectively. Sound protection was conferred in 100% of animals immunized seven days prior to challenge infection. In these animals, no clinical signs were observed, and no challenge virus RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR analyses of swabs, nasal washings, and organ samples. Moreover, the attenuated modified-live virus variant protected all chickens, mice, and ferrets as early as three days after vaccination against severe clinical signs. Chickens and ferrets developed hemagglutinin-specific antibodies after seven days, but no neuraminidase-specific antibodies, making this kind of neuraminidase-negative strain suitable for the DIVA (""differentiating vaccinated from infected animals"") strategy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014

To evaluate the pathogenicity of a 2012 H5N1 HPAIV isolate and to assess the utility of conjunctival swabs for viral detection and isolation in surveillance, an experimental infection with HPAIV subtype H5N1 was carried out in domestic ducks. Ducks were infected with 107.2 TCID50 of A/duck/Vietnam/QB1207/2012 (H5N1), which was isolated from a moribund domestic duck. In the infected ducks, clinical signs of disease, including neurological disorder, were observed. Ducks started to die at 3 days-post-infection (dpi), and the study mortality reached 67%. Viruses were recovered from oropharyngeal and conjunctival swabs until 7 dpi and from cloacal swabs until 4 dpi. In the ducks that died or were sacrificed on 3, 5, or 6 dpi, viruses were recovered from lung, brain, heart, pancreas and intestine, among which the highest virus titers were in the lung, brain or heart. Results of virus titration were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. Genetic and phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene revealed that the isolate belongs to clade 2.3.2.1 similarly to the H5N1 viruses isolated in Vietnam in 2012. The present study demonstrated that this recent HPAI H5N1 virus of clade 2.3.2.1 could replicate efficiently in the systemic organs, including the brain, and cause severe disease with neurological symptoms in domestic ducks. Therefore, this HPAI H5N1 virus seems to retain the neurotrophic feature and has further developed properties of shedding virus from the oropharynx and conjunctiva in addition to the cloaca, potentially posing a higher risk of virus spread through cross-contact and/or environmental transmission. Continued surveillance and diagnostic programs using conjunctival swabs in the field would further verify the apparent reliability of conjunctival samples for the detection of AIV. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",2014

A previous study indicated that persistence of H5N1 viruses in ducks after the development of humoral immunity may drive viral evolution following immune selection. As H5N1 HPAI is endemic in Indonesia, this mechanism may be important in understanding H5N1 evolution in that region. To determine the capability of domestic ducks to maintain prolonged shedding of Indonesian clade 2.1 H5N1 virus, two groups of Pekin ducks were inoculated through the eyes, nostrils and oropharynx and viral shedding and transmission investigated. Inoculated ducks (n = 15), which were mostly asymptomatic, shed infectious virus from the oral route from 1 to 8 days post inoculation, and from the cloacal route from 2-8 dpi. Viral ribonucleic acid was detected from 1-15 days post inoculation from the oral route and 1-24 days post inoculation from the cloacal route (cycle threshold <40). Most ducks seroconverted in a range of serological tests by 15 days post inoculation. Virus was efficiently transmitted during acute infection (5 inoculation-infected to all 5 contact ducks). However, no evidence for transmission, as determined by seroconversion and viral shedding, was found between an inoculation-infected group (n = 10) and contact ducks (n = 9) when the two groups only had contact after 10 days post inoculation. Clinical disease was more frequent and more severe in contact-infected (2 of 5) than inoculation-infected ducks (1 of 15). We conclude that Indonesian clade 2.1 H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus does not persist in individual ducks after acute infection. © 2014 Wibawa et al.",2014

A transmission experiment was carried out with pairs of chicken of which one was inoculated with H5N1 virus and the other contact-exposed. Results showed that the majority of the vaccinated birds developed haemagglutination inhibition (HI) titres below 4log2. No clinical signs were observed in the vaccinated birds and virus shedding was limited. However, nearly all vaccinated birds showed a four-fold or higher increase of HI titres after challenge or contact-exposure, which is an indication of infection. This implies that virus transmission most likely has occurred. This study showed that a single vaccination applied under field conditions induced clinical protection, but was insufficient to induce protection against virus transmission, suggesting that silent spread of virus in vaccinated commercial flocks may occur. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014

Susceptibility of pigeons to HPAIV (H5N1) and their role in avian influenza virus transmission to domestic birds and humans remain questionable. In this study, an outbreak in domestic pigeons (1 to 18 months old) with 50% mortality was investigated. Pigeons exhibited nervous manifestations and greenish diarrhoea. Necropsy of the naturally infected pigeons revealed congestion of the internal organs, particularly the lungs and brain. The HPAIV subtype H5N1 designated A/Pigeon/Egypt/SHAH-5803/2011 was isolated from a 40-day-old pigeon. Sequencing of the haemagglutinin gene showed it to be closely related to viruses in group 2.2.1/C. Intravenous inoculation of the isolate in chickens induced 100% mortality within 2 days post inoculation and the intravenous pathogenicity index was 2.7. Virus pathogenicity and transmissibility was determined experimentally in 6-week-old domestic pigeons. Thirty per cent of pigeons inoculated oronasally with 106 median embryo infective dose showed congested beak, conjunctivitis, depression, and greenish diarrhoea. A mortality rate of 10% was recorded preceded by severe neurologic signs consisting of torticollis, incoordination, tremors, and wing paralysis. Pathological examination revealed a friable brain tissue and congested meningeal blood vessels. The lungs appeared oedematous and severely haemorrhagic. Subepicardial and petechial haemorrhages on the coronary fat were observed. Both infected and contact pigeons shed virus via the oropharynx and cloaca. To our knowledge, this is the first description and characterization of HPAIV in naturally infected pigeons in Egypt. Our findings reveal that pigeons can indeed be susceptible to H5N1 HPAIVs and could be a source of infection to other birds and humans. © 2014 Houghton Trust Ltd.",2014

Most fatal human infections are caused by contact with infected poultry. Therefore, preventing the virus from entering the poultry population is a priority. This is, however, problematic in emergency situations, e.g. during outbreaks in poultry, as there are currently no mass application methods to effectively vaccinate large numbers of birds within a short period of time. To evaluate the suitability of needle-free pulmonary immunization for mass vaccination of poultry against HPAI H5N1, we performed a proof-of-concept study in which we investigated whether non-adjuvanted spray-freeze-dried (SFD) whole inactivated virus (WIV) can be used as a dry powder aerosol vaccine to immunize chickens. Our results show that chickens that received SFD-WIV vaccine as aerosolized powder directly at the syrinx (the site of the tracheal bifurcation), mounted a protective antibody response after two vaccinations and survived a lethal challenge with HPAI H5N1. Furthermore, both the number of animals that shed challenge virus, as well as the level of virus shedding, were significantly reduced. Based on antibody levels and reduction of virus shedding, pulmonary vaccination with non-adjuvanted vaccine was at least as efficient as intratracheal vaccination using live virus. Animals that received aerosolized SFD-WIV vaccine by temporary passive inhalation showed partial protection (22% survival) and a delay in time-to-death, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of the method, but indicating that the efficiency of vaccination by passive inhalation needs further improvement. Altogether our results provide a proof-of-concept that pulmonary vaccination using an SFD-WIV powder vaccine is able to protect chickens from lethal HPAI challenge. If the efficacy of pulmonary vaccination by passive inhalation can be improved, this method might be suitable for mass application. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2014

The main purpose of this work was to determine the correlation between known molecular determinants of virulence in different avian influenza virus (AIV) genes and the results of experimental infection of birds and mammals with AIV strain A/swan/Mangistau/3/06 (H5N1; SW/3/06). Methods and results: We examined the virulence of SW/3/06 in four species of birds (chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese) and five species of mammals (mice, guinea pigs, cats, dogs, pigs), and identified the molecular determinants of virulence in 11 genes (HA, NA, PB1, PB1-F2, PB2, PA, NS1, NS2, M1, M2 and NP). SW/3/06 does not possess the prime virulence determinant of HPAIV - a polybasic HA cleavage site - and is highly pathogenic in chickens. SW/3/06 replicated efficiently in chickens, ducks, turkeys, mice and dogs, causing 100% mortality within 1.6-5.2 days. In addition, no mortalities were observed in geese, guinea pigs, cats and pigs. The HI assay demonstrated all not diseased animals infected with the SW/3/06 virus had undergone seroconversion by 14, 21 and 28 dpi. Eleven mutations in the seven genes were present in SW/3/06. These mutations may play a role in the pathogenicity of this strain in chickens, ducks, turkeys, mice and dogs. Together or separately, mutations 228S-103S-318I in HA may play a role in the efficient replication of SW/3/06 in mammals (mice, dogs, pigs). Conclusions: This study provides new information on the pathogenicity of the newly-isolated swan derived H5N1 virus in birds and mammals, and explored the role of molecular determinants of virulence in different genes; such studies may help to identify key virulence or adaptation markers that can be used for global surveillance of viruses threatening to emerge into the human population. © 2014 Tabynov et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014

Vectored vaccines based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV) are very promising, but are so far licensed in only a few countries. In the present study, the immunogenicity and protection against a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza challenge were evaluated after vaccination with an enterotropic NDV vector expressing an H5 haemagglutinin (rNDV-H5) in 1-day-old specific pathogen free chickens inoculated once, twice or once followed by a heterologous boost with an inactivated H5N9 vaccine (iH5N9). The heterologous prime/boost rNDV-H5/iH5N9 combination afforded the best level of protection against the H5N1 challenge performed at 6 weeks of age. Two rNDV-H5 administrations conferred a good level of protection after challenge, although only a cellular H5-specific response could be detected. Interestingly, a single administration of rNDV-H5 gave the same level of protection as the double administration but without any detectable H5-specific immune response. In contrast to AI immunity, a high humoral, mucosal and cellular NDV-specific immunity could be detected up to 6 weeks post vaccination after using the three different vaccination schedules. NDV-specific mucosal and cellular immune responses were slightly higher after double rNDV-H5 vaccination when compared with single inoculation. Finally, the heterologous prime/boost rNDV-H5/iH5N9 combination induced a broader detectable immunity including systemic, mucosal and cellular AI and NDV-specific responses. © 2014 Houghton Trust Ltd.",2014

One dose of rHVT-H5 vaccine was administered at day 1 and birds were monitored serologically (haemagglutination inhibition test) and virologically for 19 weeks. Maternally-derived antibody and post-vaccination H5 antibody titres were measured using the Chinese (A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96(H5N1)) HA and the Egyptian (A/chicken/Egypt/128s/2012(H5N1)) HA as antigens. The challenge was conducted at 19 weeks of age and on six experimental groups: Groups I (WB) and II (BS), both vaccinated and challenged; Groups III (WB) and IV (BS), both vaccinated but not challenged; Groups V and VI, unvaccinated specific pathogen free chickens, serving respectively as positive and negative controls. The challenge virus was the clade 2.2.1 highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 A/chicken/Egypt/128s/2012 at a dose of 106median embryo infective dose. For both breeds, complete maternally-derived antibody waning occurred at the age of 4 weeks. The immune response to rHVT-H5 vaccination was detected from the sixth week. The seroconversion rates for both breeds reached 85.7 to 100% in the eighth week of age. Protection levels of 73.3%, 60% and 0% were respectively recorded in Groups I, II and V. No mortalities occurred in the unchallenged groups. Group I showed superior results for all measured post-challenge parameters. In conclusion, a single rHVT-H5 hatchery vaccination conferred a high level of protection for a relatively extended period. This vaccine could be an important tool for future A/H5N1 prevention/control in endemic countries. Further studies on persistence of immunity beyond 19 weeks, need for booster with inactivated vaccines, breed susceptibility and vaccinal response, and transmissibility are recommended. © 2014, © 2014 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).",2014

Protective antibodies, directed mainly against hemagglutinin (HA), are the primary means of protection against influenza outbreaks. A recombinant DNA vaccine based on the sequence of H5 HA from the H5N1/A/swan/Poland/305-135V08/2006 strain of HPAIV was prepared. Sequence manipulation included deletion of the proteolytic cleavage site to improve protein stability, codon usage optimization to improve translation and stability of RNA in host cells, and cloning into a commercially available vector to enable expression in animal cells. Naked plasmid DNA was complexed with a liposomal carrier and the immunization followed the prime-boost strategy. The immunogenic potential of the DNA vaccine was first proved in broilers in near-to-field conditions resembling a commercial farm. Next, the protective activity of the vaccine was confirmed in SPF layer-type chickens. Experimental infections (challenge experiments) indicated that 100% of vaccinated chickens were protected against H5N1 of the same clade and that 70% of them were protected against H5N1 influenza virus of a different clade. Moreover, the DNA vaccine significantly limited (or even eliminated) transmission of the virus to contact control chickens. Two intramuscular doses of DNA vaccine encoding H5 HA induced a strong protective response in immunized chicken. The effective protection lasted for a minimum 8 weeks after the second dose of the vaccine and was not limited to the homologous H5N1 virus. In addition, the vaccine reduced shedding of the virus. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",2014

In the current study, the antigenicity and pathogenicity of three clade 2.3.2.1 viruses (Ck/Kr/Gimje/08, Ws/Mongolia/1/09, and Ws/Mongolia/7/10) were investigated in domestic ducks and mice. The H5N1 influenza viruses in this study were antigenically similar to each other (r-values of 0.35-1.4). The three viruses replicated systemically in all tissues tested in domestic ducks, indicating high pathogenicity. However, the viruses produced different clinical signs and mortality rates: Ck/Kr/Gimje/08 and Ws/Mongolia/1/09 resulted in 100% mortality with severe neurological signs, whereas Ws/Mongolia/7/10 resulted in 50% mortality with relatively mild neurological signs. In mice, infection with Ck/Kr/Gimje/08 and Ws/Mongolia/7/10 resulted in weight loss that peaked at 4 days post-infection (22.3% and 20.8%, respectively), same MLD50 (2.2 Log10 EID50) and systemic replication. The three viruses had K deletion at the -2 position of the HA1-connecting peptide (PQRERRRK-R), which is associated with increased virulence in domestic ducks and harbored NA stalk deletion, NS1 deletion and mutation of P42S in NS1, and full length (90aa) in PB1-F2, which confer increased virulence in mice. Our study shows that clade 2.3.2.1 viruses from Korea and Mongolia are antigenically similar and highly pathogenic in both domestic ducks and mice.

However, the host immune response of ducks infected with those of H5N1 HPAIVs was unclear. Here, we compared viral distribution and mRNA expression of immune-related genes in ducks following infection with the two HPAIV (A/Duck/Guangdong/212/2004, DK212 and A/Duck/Guangdong/383/2008, DK383). DK383 could replicate in the tested tissue of ducks (brain, spleen, lungs, cloacal bursa, kidney, and pancreas) more rapid and efficiently than DK212 at 1 and 2 days post-inoculation. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of TLR3, IL-6, IL-8, and MHC class II in brains were higher than those of respective genes in lungs during the early stage of post infection. Furthermore, the expression levels of IL-6 and IL-8 in the brain of ducks following infection with DK383 were remarkably higher than those of ducks infected with DK212, respectively. Our results suggest that the shift in the H5N1 HPAIVs to increased virulence in ducks may be associated with effi{ligature}cient and rapid replication of the virus, accompanied by early destruction of host immune responses.

Ducks vaccinated with the Re-1 vaccine were protected after infection with the two H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated in 2008 (HA clades 1.1 and 2.3.4.3) showing no mortality and limited virus shedding. The Re-1 and Re-5 vaccines conferred 90-100% protection against mortality after challenge with the 2010 H5N1 HPAI viruses (HA clade 2.3.2.1.A); but vaccinated ducks shed virus for more than 7 days after challenge. Similarly, the Re-1 and Re-5 vaccines only showed partial protection against the 2011 H5N1 HPAI viruses (HA clade 2.3.2.1.A and 2.3.2.1.B), with a high proportion of vaccinated ducks shedding virus for more than 10 days. Furthermore, 50% mortality was observed in ducks vaccinated with Re-1 and challenged with the 2.3.2.1.B virus. The HA proteins of the 2011 challenge viruses had the greatest number of amino acid differences from the two vaccines as compared to the viruses from 2008 and 2009, which correlates with the lesser protection observed with these viruses.

However, pre-existing NDV antibodies may impair vector virus replication, resulting in an inefficient immune response against the foreign antigen. A chimeric NDV-based vector with functional surface glycoproteins unrelated to NDV could overcome this problem. Therefore, an NDV vector was constructed which carries the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) proteins of avian paramyxovirus type 8 (APMV-8) instead of the corresponding NDV proteins in an NDV backbone derived from the lentogenic NDV Clone 30 and a gene expressing HPAIV H5 inserted between the F and HN genes. After successful virus rescue by reverse genetics, the resulting chNDVFHN PMV8H5 was characterized in vitro and in vivo. Expression and virion incorporation of the heterologous proteins was verified by Western blot and electron microscopy. Replication of the newly generated recombinant virus was comparable to parental NDV in embryonated chicken eggs. Immunization with chNDVFHN PMV8H5 stimulated full protection against lethal HPAIV infection in chickens without as well as with maternally derived NDV antibodies.

Vaccination, used as an adjunct to improved bio-security and stamping-out policies, contributed to protecting poultry in Hong Kong from HPAI H5N1 infection in 2004-2008 although the virus was repeatedly detected in dead wild birds. The detection of clade 2.3.4 H5N1 viruses in poultry markets and a farm in Hong Kong in 2008 raised the question whether this virus has changed to evade protection from the H5 vaccines in use. We tested the efficacy of three commercial vaccines (Nobilis, Poulvac and Harbin Re-5 vaccine) in specific pathogen free white leghorn chickens against a challenge with A/chicken/Hong Kong/8825-2/2008 (clade 2.3.4) isolated from vaccinated poultry in Hong Kong and A/chicken/Hong Kong/782/2009 (clade 2.3.2). Harbin Re5 vaccine provided the best, albeit not complete protection against challenge with the clade 2.3.4 virus. All three vaccines provided good protection from death and significantly reduced virus shedding following challenge with the clade 2.3.2 virus. Only Harbin Re-5 was able to completely protect chickens from virus shedding as well as mortality. Sera from vaccinated chickens had lower geometric hemagglutination inhibition titers against A/chicken/Hong Kong/8825-2/08, as compared to two other clade 2.3.4 and one clade 0 virus. Alignment of amino-acid sequences of the haemagglutinin of A/chicken/Hong Kong/8825-2/08 and the other H5 viruses revealed several mutations in positions including 69, 71, 83, 95, 133,140, 162, 183, 189, 194 and 270 (H5 numbering) which may correlate with loss of vaccine protection.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the Mexican 2012 H7N3 HPAI virus (A/chicken/Jalisco/CPA1/2012) and determine the protection against the virus conferred by different H7 inactivated vaccines in chickens. Both adult and young chickens intranasally inoculated with the virus became infected and died at between 2 and 4 days postinoculation (p.i.). High virus titers and viral replication in many tissues were demonstrated at 2 days p.i. in infected birds. The virus from Jalisco, Mexico, had high sequence similarity of greater than 97% to the sequences of wild bird viruses from North America in all eight gene segments. The hemagglutinin gene of the virus contained a 24-nucleotide insert at the hemagglutinin cleavage site which had 100% sequence identity to chicken 28S rRNA, suggesting that the insert was the result of nonhomologous recombination with the host genome. For vaccine protection studies, both U.S. H7 low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses and a 2006 Mexican H7 LPAI virus were tested as antigens in experimental oil emulsion vaccines and injected into chickens 3 weeks prior to challenge. All H7 vaccines tested provided >90% protection against clinical disease after challenge and decreased the number of birds shedding virus and the titers of virus shed.

Domestic ducks have been recognized as one of the primary factors in the spread of H5N1 HPAI. In this study we examined the pathogenicity of H5N1 HPAI viruses in different species and breeds of domestic ducks and the effect of route of virus inoculation on the outcome of infection. We determined that the pathogenicity of H5N1 HPAI viruses varies between the two common farmed duck species, with Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) presenting more severe disease than various breeds of Anas platyrhynchos var. domestica ducks including Pekin, Mallard-type, Black Runners, Rouen, and Khaki Campbell ducks. We also found that Pekin and Muscovy ducks inoculated with two H5N1 HPAI viruses of different virulence, given by any one of three routes (intranasal, intracloacal, or intraocular), became infected with the viruses. Regardless of the route of inoculation, the outcome of infection was similar for each species but depended on the virulence of the virus used. Muscovy ducks showed more severe clinical signs and higher mortality than the Pekin ducks. In conclusion, domestic ducks are susceptible to H5N1 HPAI virus infection by different routes of exposure, but the presentation of the disease varied by virus strain and duck species. This information helps support the planning and implementation of H5N1 HPAI surveillance and control measures in countries with large domestic duck populations. © 2013 Pantin-Jackwood et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2013

Severe cases of HPAIV infections have been also reported in mammals, including humans. In both mammals and birds, the relationship between host cytokine response to the infection with HPAIVs and lethal outcome has not been well understood. In the present study, the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses A/turkey/Italy/4580/1999 (H7N1) (Ty/Italy) and A/chicken/Netherlands/2586/2003 (H7N7) (Ck/NL) and the low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) A/chicken/Ibaraki/1/2005 (H5N2) (Ck/Ibaraki) were intranasally inoculated into chickens. Ty/Italy replicated more extensively than Ck/NL in systemic tissues of the chickens, especially in the brain, and induced excessive mRNA expression of inflammatory and antiviral cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-α) in proportion to its proliferation. Using in situ hybridization, IL-6 mRNA was detected mainly in microglial nodules in the brain of the chickens infected with Ty/Italy. Capillary leakage assessed by Evans blue staining was observed in multiple organs, especially in the brains of the chickens infected with Ty/Italy, and was not observed in those infected with Ck/NL. In contrast, LPAIV caused only local infection in the chickens, with neither apparent cytokine expression nor capillary leakage in any tissue of the chickens. The present results indicate that an excessive cytokine response is induced by rapid and extensive proliferation of HPAIV and causes fatal multiple organ failure in chickens. © 2013 Kuribayashi et al.",2013

Forty out of 63 deceased wild birds belonged to the order Anseriformes, and mandarin duck was one of the dominant species. To estimate the risk of mandarin ducks as a source of virus infection in the environment, we examined the pathogenicity of a causal H5N1 HPAI virus to mandarin ducks. About half of the mandarin ducks died by inoculation with 107.0TCID50 of A/mandarin duck/ Miyazaki/22M807-1/2011 (H5N1). Viruses were mainly recovered from the trachea of the ducks sacrificed at three days post inoculation (d.p.i.). Viruses were recovered from the laryngopharyngeal swabs of the observation group until 5 d.p.i. In ducks that died at the late phase of infection, viruses were detected in the systemic organs, such as lung, kidney and colon. Together, these results showed that the H5N1 HPAI viruses, which belonged to clade 2.3.2.1 and are mainly circulating in East Asia, were lethal to mandarin ducks, indicating that mandarin ducks have the potential to disseminate the virus to other bird species.

In this study, we conducted experimental infections using wild-caught Eurasian tree sparrows (Passer montanus) to evaluate their possible epidemiological involvement in virus transmission. When tree sparrows were intranasally inoculated with the virus at a low or high dose, all sparrows excluding euthanatized birds died within 11 days after inoculation. Viruses were frequently isolated from the drinking water, oral swabs, and visceral organs of the sparrows. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the virus replicated strongly in the central nervous system, heart, and adrenal gland following primary infection in the upper respiratory tract and a probable subsequent viremic stage. In the contact infection study using virus-inoculated sparrows and untreated contact chickens, more than half of all chickens died from viral infection. In the virus transmission study in which chickens were given drinking water collected from virus-inoculated sparrows, mortality due to viral infection was observed in chickens. Our data suggest that Eurasian tree sparrows could be biological vectors of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus.

One hundred and fifty houseflies (Musca domestica L.) were equally allocated into three groups. Groups 2 and 3 were exposed to the HPAI-H5N1 virus by allowing the flies to consume food containing the virus for 15 min, while the flies in group 1 were allowed to consume H5N1-free food and would serve as a negative control group. Group 2 flies were euthanatized immediately after H5N1 exposure, while group 3 were held at room temperature for 24 hr and euthanatized. The houseflies in the transmission of the HPAI-H5N1 virus were examined by challenging three groups of housefly homogenates into layer chickens via the oral drop. Morbidity and mortality were observed for 14 days, and virus shedding monitored via oropharyngeal swabs (OS) and cloacal swabs (CS), which were collected daily and determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and virus titration. Experimental challenge showed that all the chickens of groups 2 and 3 died within 7 days of inoculation. The OS had higher concentrations of virus than CS. Moreover, the chickens of group 2 had higher concentrations of virus shedding than the chickens of group 3.

The viral load in quail PBMC was significantly lower than that in chickens. These results suggest that the induction of IFN-γ after HPAIV infection in quail is related to lower titer of HPAIV. In conclusion, the different clinical courses observed between quail and chicken infected with H5N1 HPAIV might be caused by different IFN-γ responses against the HPAIV infection. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.",2013

To develop effective vaccines for H5 HPAI in chickens, virus-like particles (VLP) were produced using a baculovirus expression system. The particles comprised hemagglutinin (HA) alone (HA-VLP) or HA in combination with a matrix protein (M1; HAM-VLP) derived from a recent clade 2.3.2.1 H5N1 HPAI virus. To compare the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of these VLPs, 10. μg HAM-VLP, the equivalent amounts of HA incorporated HA-VLP or whole inactivated virus (WIV), were emulsified with mineral oil and used to immunize chickens. The serum hemagglutination inhibition antibody levels induced by HA-VLP and HAM-VLP were comparable to WIV. Antibodies to nucleoprotein were detected only in the WIV group. Immunized chickens in each group survived and were protected against a lethal homologous virus challenge, showing no clinical signs of infection. The challenge virus was detected intermittently in some oropharyngeal swabs, but not in cloacal swabs or various organs, which means that VLPs and WIV provide protection against systemic but not local virus replication in chickens. After the challenge, the HA-VLP group showed significantly increased serum antibody levels compared to the HAM-VLP and WIV groups, and some chickens in the HA-VLP group seroconverted with respect to nucleoprotein. Taken together, these results suggest that VLPs may be an effective method for controlling HPAI in chickens. They could be applied to a differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) strategy. In addition, it is likely that HAM-VLP is more efficacious than HA-VLP in chickens. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..",2013

While some authors have clearly demonstrated that LPAIV can mutate to render highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIV), others have shown that their presence could provide the host with enough immunological memory to resist re-infections with HPAIV. In order to experimentally study the role of pre-existing host immunity, chickens previously infected with H7N2 LPAIV were subsequently challenged with H7N1 HPAIV. Pre-infection of chickens with H7N2 LAPIV conferred protection against the lethal challenge with H7N1 HPAIV, dramatically reducing the viral shedding, the clinical signs and the pathological outcome. Correlating with the protection afforded, sera from chickens primed with H7N2 LPAIV reacted with the H7-AIV subtype in hemagglutination inhibition assay and specifically with the N2-neuraminidase antigen. Conversely, subsequent exposure to H5N1 HPAIV resulted in a two days-delay on the onset of disease but all chickens died by 7 days post-challenge. Lack of protection correlated with the absence of H5-hemagglutining inhibitory antibodies prior to H5N1 HPAIV challenge. Our data suggest that in naturally occurring outbreaks of HPAIV, birds with pre-existing immunity to LPAIV could survive lethal infections with HA-homologous HPAIV but not subsequent re-infections with HA-heterologous HPAIV. These results could be useful to better understand the dynamics of AIV in chickens and might help in future vaccine formulations. © 2013 Vergara-Alert et al.",2013

Dust, produced in infected chicken flocks, has been hypothesized to be an important mechanical vector for between-flock transmission of HPAIv. Objectives The aim of our study was to quantify the amount of virus shed by infected birds and its relation to deposition of virus in the environment and the rate of dust-borne transmission between groups of chickens. Methods Four replicate experiments were performed, each replicate with two groups of 14 chickens housed in two separate rooms. In one group, chickens were inoculated with HPAIv. Ventilation forced the air from that room to the second (recipient) group through a tube. Deceased birds in the inoculated group were replaced with new susceptible birds up to day 10 p.i. Dust samples were collected daily. Trachea and cloaca swabs were collected daily to determine virus shedding and virus spread to the recipient group. Results The amount of virus detected in dust samples in the recipient room was, on average, 103·7 EID50/m3. Virus transmission from the inoculated to the recipient group occurred in two experiments. The transmission rate parameter for dust-borne transmission was estimated at 0·08 new infections/infectious chicken/day. Conclusions The results of this study are a first step to elucidate the importance of dust-borne transmission of HPAIv between flocks and help interpret environmental samples. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2013

Duck influenza, therefore, has been believed inapparent infection with influenza A viruses, including highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs) in chickens. In fact, ducks experimentally infected with an HPAIV strain, A/Hong Kong/483/1997 (H5N1) (HK483), did not show any clinical signs. Another HPAIV strain, A/whooper swan/Mongolia/3/2005 (H5N1) (MON3) isolated from a dead swan, however, caused neurological dysfunction and death in ducks. Method. To understand the mechanism whereby MON3 shows high pathogenicity in ducks, HK483, MON3, and twenty-four reassortants generated between these two H5N1 viruses were compared for their pathogenicity in domestic ducks. Results: None of the ducks infected with MON3-based single-gene reassortants bearing the PB2, NP, or NS gene segment of HK483 died, and HK483-based single-gene reassortants bearing PB2, NP, or NS genes of MON3 were not pathogenic in ducks, suggesting that multiple gene segments contribute to the pathogenicity of MON3 in ducks. All the ducks infected with the reassortant bearing PB2, PA, HA, NP, and NS gene segments of MON3 died within five days post-inoculation, as did those infected with MON3. Each of the viruses was assessed for replication in ducks three days post-inoculation. MON3 and multi-gene reassortants pathogenic in ducks were recovered from all of the tissues examined and replicated with high titers in the brains and lungs. Conclusion: The present results indicate that multigenic factors are responsible for efficient replication of MON3 in ducks. In particular, virus growth in the brain might correlate with neurological dysfunction and the disease severity. © 2013 Kajihara et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2013

Commonly used influenza vaccines are killed whole virus that protect against homologous and not heterologous virus. Using chickens we have explored the possibility of using live low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) A/goose/AB/223/2005 H1N1 or A/WBS/MB/325/2006 H1N2 to induce immunity against heterologous highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A/chicken/Vietnam/14/2005 H5N1. H1N1 and H1N2 replicated in chickens but did not cause clinical disease. Following infection, chickens developed nucleoprotein and H1 specific antibodies, and reduced H5N1 plaque size in vitro in the absence of H5 neutralizing antibodies at 21 days post infection (DPI). In addition, heterologous cell mediated immunity (CMI) was demonstrated by antigen-specific proliferation and IFN-γ secretion in PBMCs re-stimulated with H5N1 antigen. Following H5N1 challenge of both pre-infected and naïve controls chickens housed together, all naïve chickens developed acute disease and died while H1N1 or H1N2 pre-infected chickens had reduced clinical disease and 70-80% survived. H1N1 or H1N2 pre-infected chickens were also challenged with H5N1 and naïve chickens placed in the same room one day later. All pre-infected birds were protected from H5N1 challenge but shed infectious virus to naïve contact chickens. However, disease onset, severity and mortality was reduced and delayed in the naïve contacts compared to directly inoculated naïve controls. These results indicate that prior infection with LPAI virus can generate heterologous protection against HPAI H5N1 in the absence of specific H5 antibody. © 2012 Nfon et al.",2012

It has been shown that a recombinant fowlpox virus (FPV)-vectored vaccine can provide protection against HPAI in ducks. In this study, a recombinant fowlpox virus (rFPV-AIH5AIL6) coexpressing the haemagglutinin (HA) gene of the H5N1 subtype of the avian influenza virus (AIV) and chicken interleukin 6 gene was constructed and tested in Gaoyou and cherry valley ducks to evaluate the immune response in ducks. These animal studies demonstrated that rFPV-AIH5AIL6 induced a higher anti-AIV HI antibody response, an enhanced lymphocyte proliferation response, an elevated immune protection, and a reduction in virus shedding compared to a recombinant fowlpox virus expressing the HA gene alone (rFPV-SYHA).

In this study, we have analyzed the evolution and pathogenicity of 4 H5N2 avian influenza viruses isolated from apparently healthy poultry from H5N1 virus endemic areas in China. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that two of these viruses, A/duck/Eastern China/1111/2011 (DK/EC/1111/11) and A/goose/Eastern China/1112/2011 (GS/EC/1112/11) were derived from reassortment events in which clade 2.3.4 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses acquired novel neuraminidase and nonstructural protein genes. Another two isolates, A/chicken/Hebei/1102/2010 (CK/HB/1102/10) and A/duck/Hebei/0908/2009 (DK/HB/0908/09), possess hemagglutinin (HA) gene belong to clade 7 H5 viruses and other genes from endemic H9N2 viruses, or from viruses of various subtypes of the natural gene pool. All of these H5N2 isolates bear characteristic sequences of HPAI virus at the cleavage site of HA, and animal experiments indicated that all of these viruses but DK/HB/0908/09 is highly pathogenic to chickens. In particular, DK/EC/1111/11 and GS/EC/1112/11 are also highly pathogenic to ducks and moderately pathogenic to mice. All of these 4 viruses were able to replicate in domestic ducks and mice without prior adaptation. The emergence of these novel H5N2 viruses adds more evidence for the active evolution of H5 viruses in Asia. The maintenance of the highly pathogenic phenotype of some of these viruses even after reassortment with a new NA subtypes, their ability to replicate and transmit in domestic poultry, and the pathogenicity in the mammalian mouse model, highlight the potential threat posed by these viruses to both veterinary and public health. © 2012 Zhao et al.",2012

In 1999-2000 in Northern Italy, outbreaks of H7N1 low pathogenicity avian influenza virus (LPAI) were followed by the emergence of H7N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI). This study investigates the transmission dynamics in turkeys of representative HPAI and LPAI H7N1 virus strains from this outbreak in an experimental setting, allowing direct comparison of the two strains. The fitted transmission rates for the two strains are similar: 2.04 (1.5-2.7) per day for HPAI, 2.01 (1.6-2.5) per day for LPAI. However, the mean infectious period is far shorter for HPAI (1.47 (1.3-1.7) days) than for LPAI (7.65 (7.0-8.3) days), due to the rapid death of infected turkeys. Hence the basic reproductive ratio, R0 is significantly lower for HPAI (3.01 (2.2-4.0)) than for LPAI (15.3 (11.8-19.7)). The comparison of transmission rates and R0 are critically important in relation to understanding how HPAI might emerge from LPAI. Two competing hypotheses for how transmission rates vary with population size are tested by fitting competing models to experiments with differing numbers of turkeys. A model with frequency-dependent transmission gives a significantly better fit to experimental data than density-dependent transmission. This has important implications for extrapolating experimental results from relatively small numbers of birds to the commercial poultry flock size, and for how control, including vaccination, might scale with flock size. © 2012 Saenz et al.",2012

In experiment 1, when 20 pigeons were intranasally inoculated with high or low viral doses, no inoculated pigeon exhibited clinical signs for 14 days. Drinking water and almost all swab samples were negative for virus isolation. Virus isolation was positive in 3 oral swab samples from 2 pigeons from day 2 through 4 postinoculation, but viral titers of positive samples were extremely low. Immunohistochemical analysis for virus detection was negative in all tissue samples. Along with seroconversion in a limited number of pigeons postinoculation, these results suggest that pigeons have limited susceptibility to the virus used for experimental infection. In experiment 2, when uninoculated chickens were housed with virus-inoculated pigeons, all pigeons and contact chickens survived for 14 days without exhibiting any clinical signs. According to serological analysis, the chickens did not exhibit seroconversion after close contact with inoculated pigeons. Our data suggest that the risk posed by pigeons with respect to the transmission of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus to poultry would be less than that for other susceptible avian species. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.",2012

The distribution pattern of influenza virus receptors was also assessed. Captive-reared gyr-saker (Falco rusticolus x Falco cherrug) hybrid falcons were challenged with a HPAI H5N1 virus (A/Great crested grebe/Basque Country/06.03249/2006) or a LPAI H7N2 virus (A/Anas plathyrhynchos/Spain/1877/2009), both via the nasochoanal route and by ingestion of previously infected specific pathogen free chicks. Infected falcons exhibited similar infection dynamics despite the different routes of exposure, demonstrating the effectiveness of in vivo feeding route. H5N1 infected falcons died, or were euthanized, between 5-7 days post-infection (dpi) after showing acute severe neurological signs. Presence of viral antigen in several tissues was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and real time RT-PCR (RRT-PCR), which were generally associated with significant microscopical lesions, mostly in the brain. Neither clinical signs, nor histopathological findings were observed in any of the H7N2 LPAI infected falcons, although all of them had seroconverted by 11 dpi. Avian receptors were strongly present in the upper respiratory tract of the falcons, in accordance with the consistent oral viral shedding detected by RRT-PCR in both H5N1 HPAI and H7N2 LPAI infected falcons. The present study demonstrates that gyr-saker hybrid falcons are highly susceptible to H5N1 HPAI virus infection, as previously observed, and that they may play a major role in the spreading of both HPAI and LPAI viruses. For the first time in raptors, natural infection by feeding on infected prey was successfully reproduced. The use of avian prey species in falconry husbandry and wildlife rehabilitation facilities could put valuable birds of prey and humans at risk and, therefore, this practice should be closely monitored. © 2012 Bertran et al.",2012

The dissemination of HPAIV H5N1 following intestinal entry and associated pathogenesis are largely unknown. To assess the route of spread of HPAIV H5N1 to other organs and to determine its associated pathogenesis, we inoculated infected chicken liver homogenate directly into the intestine of cats by use of entericcoated capsules. Intestinal inoculation of HPAIV H5N1 resulted in fatal systemic disease. The spread of HPAIV H5N1 from the lumen of the intestine to other organs took place via the blood and lymphatic vascular systems but not via neuronal transmission. Remarkably, the systemic spread of the virus via the vascular system was associated with massive infection of endothelial and lymphendothelial cells, resulting in widespread hemorrhages. This is unique for influenza in mammals and resembles the pathogenesis of HPAIV infection in terrestrial poultry. It contrasts with the pathogenesis of systemic disease from the same virus following entry via the respiratory tract, where lesions are characterized mainly by necrosis and inflammation and are associated with the presence of influenza virus antigen in parenchymal, not endothelial cells. The marked endotheliotropism of the virus following intestinal inoculation indicates that the pathogenesis of systemic influenza virus infection in mammals may differ according to the portal of entry. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",2012

Blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), nasal cavity and brain tissue samples were obtained from 1 to 4 days post-inoculation (dpi) of infected and control chickens. Viral antigen topographical distribution, presence of influenza A virus receptors in the brain, as well as, the role of the olfactory route in virus CNS invasion were studied using different immunohistochemistry techniques. Besides, viral RNA load in CSF and blood was quantified by means of a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Viral antigen was observed widely distributed in the CNS, showing bilateral and symmetrical distribution in the nuclei of the diencephalon, mesencephalon and rhombencephalon. Viral RNA was detected in blood and CSF at one dpi, indicating that the virus crosses the blood-CSF-barrier early during infection. This early dissemination is possibly favoured by the presence of Sia2,3 Gal and Sia2,6 Gal receptors in brain vascular endothelial cells, and Sia2,3 Gal receptors in ependymal and choroid plexus cells. No viral antigen was observed in olfactory sensory neurons, while the olfactory bulb showed only weak staining, suggesting that the virus did not use this pathway to enter into the brain. The sequence of virus appearance and the topographical distribution of this H7N1 HPAIV indicate that the viral entry occurs via the haematogenous route, with early and generalized spreading through the CSF. © 2011 Chaves et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2011

This mainly applies to layer and breeder flocks, but broilers are usually left unvaccinated. Here we investigate whether vaccination is able to reduce HPAI H5N1 virus transmission among broiler chickens. Four sets of experiments were carried out, each consisting of 22 replicate trials containing a pair of birds. Experiments 1-3 were carried out with four-week-old birds that were unvaccinated, and vaccinated at day 1 or at day 10 of age. Experiment 4 was carried out with unvaccinated day-old broiler chicks. One chicken in each trial was inoculated with H5N1 HPAI virus. One chicken in each trial was inoculated with virus. The course of the infection chain was monitored by serological analysis, and by virus isolation performed on tracheal and cloacal swabs. The analyses were based on a stochastic SEIR model using a Bayesian inferential framework. When inoculation was carried out at the 28 th day of life, transmission was efficient in unvaccinated birds, and in birds vaccinated at first or tenth day of life. In these experiments estimates of the latent period (∼1.0 day), infectious period (∼3.3 days), and transmission rate parameter (∼1.4 per day) were similar, as were estimates of the reproduction number (∼4) and generation interval (∼1.4 day). Transmission was significantly less efficient in unvaccinated chickens when inoculation was carried out on the first day of life. These results show that vaccination of broiler chickens does not reduce transmission, and suggest that this may be due to the interference of maternal immunity. © 2011 Poetri et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2011

Airborne transmission has often been suggested as a route of transmission between flocks, but knowledge of the rate of transmission via this route is sparse. In the current study, we quantified the rate of airborne transmission of an HPAI H5N1 virus strain between chickens under experimental conditions. In addition, we quantified viral load in air and dust samples. Sixteen trials were done, comprising a total of 160 chickens housed in cages, with three treatment groups. The first group was inoculated with strain A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005 H5N1, the second and third group were not inoculated, but housed at 0.2 and 1.1. m distance of the first group, respectively. Tracheal and cloacal swabs were collected daily of each chicken to monitor virus transmission. Air and dust samples were taken daily to quantify virus load in the immediate surroundings of the birds. Samples were tested by quantitative RRT-PCR and virus isolation. In 4 out of 16 trials virus was transmitted from the experimentally inoculated chickens to the non-inoculated chickens. The transmission rate was 0.13 and 0.10 new infections per infectious bird at 0.2. m and 1.1. m, respectively. The difference between these estimates was, however, not significant. Two air samples tested positive in virus isolation, but none of these samples originated from the trials with successful transmission. Five dust samples were confirmed positive in virus isolation. The results of this study demonstrate that the rate of airborne transmission between chickens over short distances is low, suggesting that airborne transmission over a long distance is an unlikely route of spread. Whether or not this also applies to the field situation needs to be examined. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011

However, host immune responses of pigeons inoculated with HPAIVs have not been well documented. To assess host responses of pigeons against HPAIV infection, we compared lethality, viral distribution and mRNA expression of immune related genes of pigeons infected with two HPAIVs (A/Pigeon/Thailand/VSMU-7-NPT/2004; Pigeon04 and A/Tree sparrow/Ratchaburi/VSMU-16-RBR/2005; T.sparrow05) isolated from wild birds in Thailand. The survival experiment showed that 25% of pigeons died within 2 weeks after the inoculation of two HPAIVs or medium only, suggesting that these viruses did not cause lethal infection in pigeons. Pigeon04 replicated in the lungs more efficiently than T.sparrow05 and spread to multiple extrapulmonary organs such as the brain, spleen, liver, kidney and rectum on days 2, 5 and 9 post infection. No severe lesion was observed in the lungs infected with Pigeon04 as well as T.sparrow05 throughout the collection periods. Encephalitis was occasionally observed in Pigeon04- or T.sparrow05-infected brain, the severity, however was mostly mild. To analyze the expression of immune-related genes in the infected pigeons, we established a quantitative real-time PCR analysis for 14 genes of pigeons. On day 2 post infection, Pigeon04 induced mRNA expression of Mx1, PKR and OAS to a greater extent than T.sparrow05 in the lungs, however their expressions were not up-regulated concomitantly on day 5 post infection when the peak viral replication was observed. Expressions of TLR3, IFNα, IL6, IL8 and CCL5 in the lungs following infection with the two HPAIVs were low. In sum, Pigeon04 exhibited efficient replication in the lungs compared to T.sparrow05, but did not induce excessive host cytokine expressions.

However, our current knowledge regarding the in vivo role of virus-encoded NS1 in chickens is much more limited. Here, we report that highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of subtypes H5N1 and H7N7 lacking fully functional NS1 genes were attenuated in 5-week-old chickens. Surprisingly, in diseased birds infected with NS1 mutants, the IFN levels were not higher than in diseased birds infected with wild-type virus, suggesting that NS1 cannot suppress IFN gene expression in at least one cell population of infected chickens that produces large amounts of the cytokine in vivo. To address the question of why influenza viruses are highly pathogenic in chickens although they strongly activate the innate immune system, we determined whether recombinant chicken alpha interferon (IFN-α) can inhibit the growth of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in cultured chicken cells and whether it can ameliorate virus-induced disease in 5-week-old birds. We found that IFN treatment failed to confer substantial protection against challenge with highly pathogenic viruses, although it was effective against viruses with low pathogenic potential. Taken together, our data demonstrate that preventing the synthesis of IFN is not the primary role of the viral NS1 protein during infection of chickens. Our results further suggest that virus-induced IFN does not contribute substantially to resistance of chickens against highly pathogenic influenza viruses. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.",2011

According to an early report, chicken Mx1 variants encoding Asn at position 631 have antiviral activity, whereas variants with Ser at 631 lack activity in experiments evaluating Mx1 complementary DNA (cDNA) expressed ectopically in a cell line. We evaluated whether the Mx1 631 dimorphism influenced pathogenesis of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) infection in chickens of two commercial broiler lines, each segregating for Asn631 and Ser631 variants. Following intranasal infection with HPAIV strain A/Chicken/Queretaro/14588-19/1995 H5N2, chickens homozygous for Asn631 allele were significantly more resistant to disease based on early mortality, morbidity, or virus shedding than Ser631 homozygotes. Higher amounts of splenic cytokine transcripts were observed in the Ser631 birds after infection, consistent with higher viral loads seen in this group and perhaps contributing to their higher morbidity. Nucleotide sequence determination of Mx1 cDNAs demonstrated that the Asn631 variants in the two chicken lines differed at several amino acid positions outside 631. In vitro experiments with a different influenza strain (low pathogenicity) failed to demonstrate an effect of Mx1 Asn631 on viral replication suggesting that in vivo responses may differ markedly from in vitro, or that choice of virus strain may be critical in demonstrating effects of chicken Mx1. Overall, these studies provide the first evidence that Mx1 has antiviral effects in chickens infected with influenza virus. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",2011

Viral RNA loads were also quantified in different tissues, blood, oropharyngeal swabs, and cloacal swabs using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Clinical signs of depression, apathy, listlessness, huddling and ruffled feathers were recorded in G1 and a few G2 birds, whilst neurological signs were only observed in chickens inoculated with the highest dose. Gross lesions of haemorrhages were observed in the unfeathered skin of the comb and legs, and skeletal muscle, lung, pancreas and kidneys of birds inoculated with 105.5 ELD50 and 103.5 ELD50 doses. Microscopic lesions and viral antigen were demonstrated in cells of the nasal cavity, lung, heart, skeletal muscle, brain, spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, liver, bone marrow, thymus, bursa of Fabricius, spleen, kidney, adrenal gland and skin. Viral RNA was detected by RT-qPCR in kidney, lung, intestine, and brain samples of G1 and G2 birds. However, in birds infected with the lowest dose, viral RNAwas detected only in brain and lung samples in low amounts at 5 and 7 days post infection. Interestingly, viral shedding was observed in oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs with proportionate decrease with the inoculation dose. We conclude that although an adequate infectious dose is critical in reproducing the clinical infection, chickens exposed to lower doses can be infected and shed virus representing a risk for the dissemination of the viral agent. © 2011 Houghton Trust Ltd.",2011

The aim of this study was to determine the probability of infection and to determine dose-dependent virus transmission (direct transmission) for various inoculation doses.Two transmission experiments with pair-wise housed layer type chickens were performed, in which one bird per pair was inoculated with an HPAI H5N1 virus and the other contact-exposed. Various inoculation doses were used to determine the susceptibility (ID50), and possible relation between ID50, and infectiousness, expressed as the amount of virus shedding and the probability of contact birds becoming infected.The infectious H5N1 dose (CID50) in this study was an estimated 102.5 egg infectious dose (EID50). Increasing the dose increased the probability of infection but survival from infection was independent of dose. In addition, increasing the dose decreased the mean latent period in the inoculated chickens significantly. This could be important for determining the time of onset of infection in a flock and thus allowing more accurate identification of the source of infection. Moreover, the amount of virus shed in trachea and cloaca by the inoculated chickens in the time between inoculation and contact infection, also differed between the various dose groups. Despite differences in latent period and virus shedding, the transmission rate parameter β and reproduction ratio R0 did not differ significantly between the various dose groups. This implies that in this experiment the amount of virus shedding is not a measure to predict transmission or the infectiousness of chickens. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",2011

However, engineering of a polybasic cleavage site into an avian influenza virus of low pathogenicity does not result in transformation into an HPAIV, indicating the importance of other adaptations. Here, the influence of amino acids adjacent to the HA cleavage site on virulence was studied. Most HPAIVs of subtype H5 carry serine or threonine at position 346 (corresponding to position 323 according to H3 numbering), whereas almost all low-pathogenic H5 viruses have valine. Moreover, all H5 low-pathogenic strains carry threonine at position 351 (corresponding to position 328 according to H3 numbering), suggesting that acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site involves several steps. This study generated a virus mutant derived from HPAIV A/Swan/Germany/R65/06 H5N1 (R65) with a monobasic cleavage site, R65mono-S-ER, and the following additional mutants: R65mono-V-ER with serine changed to valine at position 346, and R65mono-S-ETR and R65mono-V-ETR with threonine inserted at position 351. Moreover, in the R65 HA, serine was replaced with valine at position 346 (R65-V). Infection of chickens with R65 mono-S-ETR or R65mono-S-ER led to slight transient respiratory symptoms, whereas R65-infected animals died within 2 days. However, chickens infected with R65-V survived longer than R65-infected animals, indicating that serine 346 in R65 HA contributes to virulence. These data suggest that evolution of H5 HPAIVs from low-pathogenic precursors, besides acquisition of a polybasic cleavage site, involves adaptation of neighbouring regions. © 2011 SGM.",2011

Background Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 infections in felids have been reported in several countries. Feeding on infected birds has been suggested as potential source of infection. Objectives The study aimed to verify gastrointestinal infection as possible portal of entry for HPAIV H5N1 in cats. Methods Four cats were infected oculo-nasopharyngeally with 106 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) of HPAIV H5N1 A/cat/Germany/R606/2006. Two cats were infected intravenously with 106 EID50 and two cats were inoculated orally with 107 EID50 HPAIV embedded in gelatine capsules to mimic gastrointestinal exposure and to avoid virus contact to oropharyngeal or respiratory tissues. Cats were monitored for 6 days by physical examination, virus excretion, and peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. Blood chemical parameters (including AST, ALT, CPK, and TBIL) and viral excretion using pharyngeal and rectal swabs were analyzed. Results Infected cats showed elevated body temperature up to 41·3°C starting from day 1 or 2 p.i. All infected cats excreted virus in pharyngeal swabs within 2days p.i. co-inciding with the development of clinical signs (anorexia, depression, and labored breathing) irrespective of the infection route. Virus dissemination occurred through cell-free and cell-associated viremia. Infected cats developed lymphopenia, hepatic necrosis, pneumonia, and significantly elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and TBIL. Conclusions The experiments show that the gastrointestinal tract can serve as portal for the entry of HPAIV H5N1 into cats. Infection routes used did not influence viral tissue tropism and course of disease. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",2010

Rapid identification of infectious individuals or animals is crucial not only for avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance programmes, but also for treatment and containment strategies. This study used a combination of quantitative real-time RT-PCR with an internal positive control and a cell-titration system to examine the presence of virus in different samples during active experimental AIV infection and its persistence in the infected carcasses. Oropharyngeal/cloacal swabs as well as feather pulp and blood samples were collected from 15-day-old chicks infected with H7N1 highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) and the kinetics of virus shedding during active infection were evaluated. Additionally, several samples (muscle, skin, brain, feather pulp and oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs) were examined to assess the persistence of virus in the HPAIV-infected carcasses. Based on the results, feather pulp was found to be the best sample to detect and isolate HPAIV from infected chicks from 24 h after inoculation onwards. Kinetic studies on the persistence of virus in infected carcasses revealed that tissues such as muscle could potentially transmit infectious virus for 3 days post-mortem (p.m.), whilst other tissues such as skin, feather pulp and brain retained their infectivity for as long as 5-6 days p.m. at environmental temperature (22-23 °C). These results strongly favour feather as a useful sample for HPAIV diagnosis in infected chickens as well as in carcasses. © 2010 SGM.",2010

However, little is known about its persistence in contaminated tissues derived from infected birds. We investigated avian influenza virus (H5N1) persistence in feathers detached from bodies of infected ducks to evaluate their potential risk for environmental contamination. Four-week-old domestic ducks were inoculated with different clades of avian influenza virus (H5N1). Feathers, drinking water, and feces were collected on day 3 postinoculation and stored at 4°C or 20°C. Viral persistence in samples was investigated for 360 days by virus isolation and reverse transcription-PCR. Infectious viruses persisted for the longest period in feathers, compared with drinking water and feces, at both 4°C and 20°C. Viral infectivity persisted in the feathers for 160 days at 4°C and for IS days at 20°C. Viral titers of 104.3 50% egg infectious doses/ml or greater were detected for 120 days in feathers stored at 4°C. Viral RNA in feathers was more stable than the infectivity. These results indicate that feathers detached from domestic ducks infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) can be a source of environmental contamination and may function as fomites with high viral loads in the environment.

In mute swans, this virus had strong vascular endothelial cell tropism, producing acute severe disease and 100% mortality; the virus was detected in various parenchymal cells; and necrotic and inflammatory changes were noted in a range of organs, including pancreas, brain, spleen, heart, oral cavity, adrenal gland, lung, and liver. The ruddy shelducks had 100% mortality, but time to death was delayed, and the lesions were primarily restricted to the brain, heart, pancreas, and spleen. The mandarin ducks had only a single mortality, with lesions similar to those in ruddy shelducks. The greylag geese became infected, developed neurological signs, and had residual meningoencephalitis when examined at termination but lacked mortality. The mallards had asymptomatic infection.

Infection of felids by H5N1 HPAI virus is often fatal, and cat-to-cat transmission has been documented. Domestic cats may then be involved in the transmission of infection to other animals but also to humans. A particular concern is the hypothetical role of the cat in the adaptation of the virus to mammalian species, thus increasing the pandemic risk. Therefore, the development of a HPAI vaccine for domestic cats should be considered a veterinary and also a public health priority. Here we show that vaccination of cats with a recombinant canarypox (ALVAC®1) virus, expressing the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus A/chicken/Indonesia/03 (H5N1) confers protection against challenge infection with two antigenically distinct H5N1 virus isolates from humans. Despite low hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibody titers at the time of challenge, all vaccinated cats were protected against mortality and had reduced histopathological changes in the lungs. Importantly, viral shedding was reduced in vaccinated cats as compared to controls, suggesting that vaccination of cats could reduce the risk of viral transmission. In conclusion this study showed that the recombinant canarypox virus protected cats against homologous and heterologous H5N1 HPAI virus challenges. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2010

Objectives: To study the effect of host age on the shedding and tissue dissemination of a HPAI H5N1 virus in infected Pekin ducks. Methods: Pekin ducks in two age-matched groups (n = 18), 8 and 12 weeks old (wo) were each infected with 106 EID50/0·1 ml of HPAI A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (H5N1, clade 2·2). Each day for 5 days, birds were monitored clinically, and cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs collected, before three birds from each group were selected randomly for post-mortem examination. Tissue samples were collected for examination by real-time RT-PCR, histopathology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: Severe clinical signs, including incoordination and torticollis were observed in the 8 wo group resulting in 100% mortality by 4 dpi. Mild clinical signs were observed in the 12 wo group with no mortality. Real-time RT-PCR and IHC results demonstrated the systemic spread of H5N1 virus in birds of both age groups. Higher levels of virus shedding were detected in oropharyngeal swabs than in cloacal swabs, with similar levels of shedding detected in both age groups. Variations in level and temporal dissemination of virus within tissues of older ducks, and the presence of the virus in brain and heart were observed, which coincided with the appearance of clinical signs preceding death in younger birds. Conclusions: These results are consistent with reports of natural infections of wild waterfowl and poultry possibly indicating an age-related association with dissemination and clinical outcome in ducks following infection with H5N1 HPAI virus. © 2009 Crown copyright.",2010

Additionally, we compared the cell tropism of both viruses by immunohistochemistry and virus histochemistry. Three domestic cats were inoculated intratracheally with HPAIV H7N7. Virus excretion was restricted to the pharynx. At necropsy, 7 days post inoculation, lesions were restricted to the respiratory tract in all cats. Lesions consisted of diffuse alveolar damage and colocalized with virus antigen expression in type II pneumocytes and nonciliated bronchiolar cells. The attachment patterns of HPAIV H7N7 and H5N1 were similar: both viruses attached to nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells, type II pneumocytes, as well as alveolar macrophages. These data show for the first time that a non-H5 HPAIV is able to infect and cause respiratory disease in cats. The failure of HPAIV H7N7 to spread beyond the respiratory tract was not explained by differences in cell tropism compared to HPAIV H5N1.

The role of wild birds, which are the natural reservoirs for the virus, in the epidemiology of the H5N1 virus has raised great public health concern, but their role in the spread of the virus within the natural ecosystem of free-ranging terrestrial wild mammals remains unclear. In this study, we investigated H5N1 virus infection in wild pikas in an attempt to trace the circulation of the virus. Seroepidemiological surveys confirmed a natural H5N1 virus infection of wild pikas in their native environment. The hemagglutination gene of the H5N1 virus isolated from pikas reveals two distinct evolutionary clades, a mixed/Vietnam H5N1 virus sublineage (MV-like pika virus) and a wild bird Qinghai (QH)-like H5N1 virus sublineage (QH-like pika virus). The amino acid residue (glutamic acid) at position 627 encoded by the PB2 gene of the MV-like pika virus was different from that of the QH-like pika virus; the residue of the MV-like pika virus was the same as that of the goose H5N1 virus (A/GS/Guangdong [GD]/1/96). Further, we discovered that in contrast to the MV-like pika virus, which is nonpathogenic to mice, the QH-like pika virus is highly pathogenic. To mimic the virus infection of pikas, we intranasally inoculated rabbits, a species closely related to pikas, with the H5N1 virus of pika origin. Our findings first demonstrate that wild pikas are mammalian hosts exposed to H5N1 subtype avian influenza viruses in the natural ecosystem and also imply a potential transmission of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus from wild mammals into domestic mammalian hosts and humans.

Consecutive or simultaneous infections with different subtypes of influenza viruses of low pathogenicity (LPAIV) are very common in wild duck populations. To better understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of HPAIV H5N1 infections in natural ecosystems, we investigated the influence of prior infection of mallards with homo- (H5N2) and heterosubtypic (H4N6) LPAIV on exposure to HPAIV H5N1. In mallards with homosubtypic immunity induced by LPAIV infection, clinical disease was absent and shedding of HPAIV from respiratory and intestinal tracts was grossly reduced compared to the heterosubtypic and control groups (mean GEC/100 μl at 3 dpi: 3.0×102 vs. 2.3×104 vs. 8.7×104; p&lt;0.05). Heterosubtypic immunity induced by an H4N6 infection mediated a similar but less pronounced effect. We conclude that the epidemiology of HPAIV H5N1 in mallards and probably other aquatic wild bird species is massively influenced by interfering immunity induced by prior homo- and heterosubtypic LPAIV infections. © 2009 Fereidouni et al.",2009

In the present study, efficacy of this vectored vaccine (ILTV-ΔUL50IH5V) against different H5 HPAIV was evaluated in 6-week-old chickens. After a single ocular immunization all animals developed HA-specific antibodies, and were protected against lethal infection not only with the homologous HPAIV isolate A/duck/Vietnam/TG24-01/2005 (H5N1, clade 1, hemagglutinin amino acid sequence identity 100%), but also with heterologous HPAIV A/swan/Germany/R65/2006 (H5N1, clade 2.2, identity 96.1%) or HPAIV A/chicken/Italy/8/98 (H5N2, identity 93.8%). No symptoms of disease were observed after challenge with the H5N1 viruses, and only 20% of H5N2 challenged animals developed minimal clinical signs. Real-time RT-PCR analyses of oropharyngeal swabs revealed limited challenge virus replication, but the almost complete absence of HPAIV RNA from cloacal swabs indicated that no generalized infections occurred. Thus, unlike several previous vectors, ILTV-ΔUL50IH5V was able to protect chickens against different HPAIV isolates of the H5 subtype. Vaccination with HA-expressing ILTV also allowed differentiation of immunized from AIV-infected animals by serological tests for antibodies against influenza virus nucleoprotein. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Methodology/Principal Finding: Here, we constructed two recombinant NDVs (rNDVs) each of which expresses the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of HPAIV H5N1strain A/Vietnam/1203/2004 from an added gene. In one, rNDV (rNDV-HA), the open reading frame (ORF) of HA gene was expressed without modification. In the second, rNDV (rNDV-HAF), the ORF was modified so that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the encoded HA gene were replaced with those of the NDV F protein. The insertion of either version of the HA ORF did not increase the virulence of the rNDV vector. The HA protein was found to be incorporated into the envelopes of both rNDV-HA and rNDV-HAF.

To better understand the basis of the increased pathogenicity of recent Asian H5N1 HPAI viruses in chickens, we compared the fevers and mean death times (MDTs) of chickens infected with the Asian H5N1 A/chicken/Yamaguchi/7/04 (CkYM7) strain with those infected with the H5N1 Duck/Yokohama/aq10/03 (DkYK10) strain, using a wireless thermosensor. Asian H5N1 CkYM7 caused peracute death in chickens before fever could be induced, whereas DkYK10 virus induced high fevers and had a long MDT. Real-time PCR analyses of cytokine mRNA expressions showed that CkYM7 quickly induced antiviral and proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expressions at 24 h postinfection (hpi) that suddenly decreased at 32 hpi. In contrast, these cytokine mRNA expressions increased at 24 hpi in the DkYK10 group, but decreased from 48 hpi onward to levels similar to those resulting from infection with the low-pathogenicity H5N2 A/chicken/Ibaraki/1/2004 strain. Sequential titrations of viruses in lungs, spleens, and kidneys demonstrated that CkYM7 replicated rapidly and efficiently in infected chickens and that the viral titers were more than twofold higher than those of DkYK10. CkYM7 preferentially and efficiently replicated in macrophages and vascular endothelial cells, while DkYK10 grew moderately in macrophages. These results indicate that the increased pathogenicity in chickens of the recent Asian H5N1 HPAI viruses may be associated with extremely rapid and high replication of the virus in macrophages and vascular endothelial cells, which resulted in disruption of the thermoregulation system and innate immune responses.

In Indonesia the majority of local outbreaks have occurred in back yard flocks with native chickens, and it is therefore of interest to determine whether these birds can be protected against infection by vaccination. To this end two transmission experiments were carried out with H5N1 virus (A/chicken/Legok/2003) in vaccinated and unvaccinated native chickens. The vaccine contained an inactivated heterologous H5N2 strain (A/turkey/England/N28/73 H5N2). Birds were vaccinated at 4 and 7 weeks of age and challenged at 10 weeks of age. During 10 days post-challenge tracheal and cloacal swabs were taken for virus isolation, and serum blood was collected regularly to measure haemaglutinin inhibiting (HI) antibody responses. The results show that transmission of H5N1 virus was rapid and efficient in unvaccinated birds, that infection and transmission were completely prevented in vaccinated birds, and that vaccinated birds that were exposed to unvaccinated inoculated birds were still protected from infection.

The postmortem tissues collected from the chickens and quails on day 3 and days 4-5 and from clinically normal ducks that were euthanized on day 4 contained the virus. However, the ducks had significantly lower viral titers than the chickens or quails. Thus, the three avian species varied significantly in their clinical signs, mortality, tissue virus titers, and duration of virus shedding. Our observations suggest that duck and quail farms should be monitored particularly closely for the presence of HPAIV so that further virus transmission to other avian or mammalian hosts can be prevented.",2009

Currently commercially available vaccines often do not provide sufficient protection and do not allow easy discrimination between vaccinated and infected birds. Therefore, vaccination of domestic poultry against H5 and H7 HPAIV is not allowed in many countries, or is only possible after special permission has been provided. We generated a recombinant marker vaccine based on non-transmissible vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the HA antigen of HPAIV A/FPV/Rostock/34 (H7N1) in place of the VSV G gene. This virus, VSV*ΔG(HA), was propagated on a helper cell line providing VSV G in trans. Since no progeny virus was produced after infection of non-complementing cells, the vector was classified as biosafety level 1 organism (""safe""). Chickens were immunized via the intramuscular route. Following booster vaccination with the same replicons high titers of serum antibodies were induced, which neutralized avian influenza viruses of subtypes H7N1 and H7N7 but not H5N2. Vaccinated chickens were protected against a lethal dose of heterologous HPAIV A/chicken/Italy/445/99 (H7N1). Secretion of challenge virus was short-term and significantly reduced. Finally, it was possible to discriminate vaccinated chickens from infected ones by a simple ELISA assay. We propose that VSV replicons have the potential to be developed to high-quality vaccines for protection of poultry against different subtypes of avian influenza viruses. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In the first experiment, the triangular relationship among the antigen levels of test vaccines, the hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody response, and the protective effect against challenge with a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus, A/chicken/Yamaguchi/7/04 (H5N1), was confirmed. Then lasting immunity of chickens after a single-shot vaccination was confirmed in the second experiment. As a result, complete protection after the challenge was observed in chickens immunized by test vaccines with an antigen level of 160 HA units/dose or higher. Thus, it was ascertained that the minimum antigen level in the AI vaccine was 160 HA units/dose, and the minimum HI antibody titer that could protect chickens from HPAI virus infection-related death was considered to be 1:16. Dose-dependent HI antibody responses were observed in chickens after the vaccination. Thus, 640 HA units/dose was thought to be similar to the optimal antigen level.

Using reverse genetics, a set of experimental live attenuated vaccine strains based on recombinant H5N1 influenza virus A/Viet Nam/1203/04 was generated. Each virus was attenuated through expression of a hemagglutinin protein in which the polybasic cleavage site had been removed. Viruses were generated which possessed a full-length NS1 or a C-terminally truncated NS1 protein of 73, 99, or 126 amino acids. Viruses with each NS genotype were combined with a PB2 polymerase gene which carried either a lysine or a glutamic acid at position 627. We predicted that glutamic acid at position 627 of PB2 would attenuate the virus in mammalian hosts, thus increasing the safety of the vaccine. All recombinant viruses grew to high titers in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs but were attenuated in mammalian cell culture. Induction of high levels of beta interferon by all viruses possessing truncations in the NS1 protein was demonstrated by interferon bioassay. The viruses were each found to be highly attenuated in a mouse model. Vaccination with a single dose of any virus conferred complete protection from death upon challenge with a mouse lethal virus expressing H5N1 hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. In a chicken model, vaccination with a single dose of a selected virus encoding the NS1 1-99 protein completely protected chickens from lethal challenge with homologous HPAI virus A/Viet Nam/1203/04 (H5N1) and provided a high level of protection from a heterologous virus, A/egret/Egypt/01/06 (H5N1). Thus, recombinant influenza A/Viet Nam/1203/04 viruses attenuated through the introduction of mutations in the hemagglutinin, NS1, and PB2 coding regions display characteristics desirable for live attenuated vaccines and hold potential as vaccine candidates in poultry as well as in mammalian hosts.

This potential, however, varies between species and is dependent on several virus and host factors, including habitat utilization, susceptibility, and viral shedding patterns. To provide data on susceptibility and shedding patterns of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) and rock pigeons (Columba livia), 20 birds from each species were inoculated with decreasing concentrations of A/whooper swan/Mongolia/244/05 (H5N1) HPAI virus, and the birds were evaluated for morbidity, mortality, viral shedding, and seroconversion over a 14-day trial. The house sparrows were highly susceptible to the H5N1 HPAI virus as evidenced by low infectious and lethal viral doses. In addition, house sparrows excreted virus via the oropharynx and cloaca for several days prior to the onset of clinical signs. Based on these results, house sparrows could play a role in the dissemination of H5N1 HPAI virus in poultry. In contrast, pigeons were resistant to the HPAI virus, requiring a high concentration of virus to produce infection or death. When infection did occur, the duration of viral shedding was brief, and viral titers were low. The data suggests that pigeons would contribute little to the transmission and spread of H5N1 HPAI virus in poultry.",2009

In this study, we used 3 HPAI viruses isolated in Thailand in January 2004 from chicken, quail, and duck for genetic and pathogenetic studies. Sequence analysis of the entire genomes of these isolates revealed that they were genetically similar to each other. Chickens, quails, domestic ducks, and cross-bred ducks were inoculated with these isolates to evaluate their pathogenicity to different host species. A/chicken/Yamaguchi/7/04 (H5N1), an HPAI virus isolated in Japan, was also used in the chicken and quail studies for comparison. All four isolates were shown to be highly pathogenic to chickens and quails, with 100% mortality by 106 EID50 inoculants of the viruses. They caused sudden death in chickens and quails within 2-4 days after inoculation. The mean death times (MDT) of quails infected with the Thai isolates were shorter than those of chickens infected with the same isolates. Mortality against domestic and cross-bred ducks ranged from 50 to 75% by intranasal inoculation with the 106 EID50 viruses. Neurological symptoms were observed in most of the inoculated domestic ducks and appeared less severe in the cross-bred ducks. The MDTs of the ducks infected with the Thai isolates were 4.8-6 days post-inoculation. Most of the surviving ducks infected with the Thai isolates had sero-converted until 14 dpi. Our study illustrated the pathobiology of the Thai isolates against different poultry species and would provide useful information for improving control strategies against HPAI. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In addition, several HPAIV exhibit a zooanthroponotic potential and can cause fatal infections in humans. These attributes particularly apply to HPAIV H5N1 of Asian origin. Due to the absence of overt clinical symptoms, introduction and subsequent spread of HPAIV H5N1 in domestic waterfowl (especially ducks) may occur undetected, which increases the risk of transspecies transmissions to highly vulnerable gallinaceous poultry and mammals, including humans. Humans may also become infected with HPAIV H5N1 by food products from slaughtered, silently infected ducks. Vaccination against HPAIV can raise a protective barrier against an incursion of HPAIV since, at least under experimental conditions, the reproduction factor R0, is lowered to &lt;1, which ensures eradication of the virus. The objective of this study was to analyse whether these results can also be obtained under free-ranging field conditions in commercially reared flocks of goose parents and fattening ducks injected with a licensed, adjuvanted inactivated H5N2 vaccine. The time and labour required for the vaccination of these geese and duck flocks exceeded expected values, mainly due to animal sorting according to foot ring labels. No adverse effects directly associated with vaccination were observed. Serologically, a homogenous H5-specific antibody response was induced. Titres varied with temporal distance from the last application of vaccine. Geese parents were clinically protected against challenge with HPAIV A/Cygnus cygnus/Germany/R65/06 (H5N1), but still could be infected and spread HPAIV H5N1, albeit at lower levels and for shorter periods compared to unvaccinated controls.

There is little available information on the ability of LPAI viruses to cause viraemia or on the presence of avian influenza viruses in general in the muscles of infected turkeys. The aim of the present study was to determine the ability of LPAI and HPAI H7N1 viruses to reach muscle tissues following experimental infection and to determine the efficacy of vaccination in preventing viraemia and meat localization. The potential of infective muscle tissue to act as a source of infection for susceptible turkeys by mimicking the practice of swill-feeding was also investigated. The HPAI virus was isolated from blood and muscle tissues of all unvaccinated turkeys; LPAI could be isolated only from blood of one bird and could be detected only by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in muscles. In contrast, no viable virus or viral RNA could be detected in muscles of vaccinated/challenged turkeys, indicating that viral localization in muscle tissue is prevented in vaccinated birds. © 2008 Houghton Trust Ltd.",2008

Virological, histological and serological features of H5N1 virus infection in pigs were characterized in this study. Two- to three-week-old domestic piglets were intranasally inoculated with 106 EID50 of A/Vietnam/1203/04 (VN/04), A/chicken/Indonesia/7/03 (Ck/Indo/03), A/Whooper swan/Mongolia/244/05 (WS/Mong/05), and A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/ 209/05 (MDk/VN/05) viruses. Swine H3N2 and H1N1 viruses were studied as a positive control for swine influenza virus infection. The pathogenicity of the H5N1 HPAI viruses was also characterized inmouse and ferret animalmodels. Intranasal inoculation of pigs with H5N1 viruses or consumption of infected chicken meat did not result in severe disease. Mild weight loss was seen in pigs inoculated with WS/Mong/05, Ck/Indo/03 H5N1 and H1N1 swine influenza viruses.

Natural transmission of HPAIV H5N1 from poultry to humans, resulting in infections associated with high mortality, and from poultry or wild birds to large felids and domestic cats has been reported. Experimental infection of cats with HPAIV H5N1 derived from a human patient resulted in lethal disease. The role of cats in the adaptation of HPAIV H5N1 to mammals and vaccination regimens for the eventual protection of cats, however, remain to be elucidated. Here, it was shown that cats can be protected against a lethal high-dose challenge infection by an inactivated, adjuvanted heterologous H5N6 avian influenza virus vaccine. The challenge HPAIV H5N1 was derived from a naturally infected cat. In non-vaccinated cats, low-dose exposure resulted in asymptomatic infections with minimal virus excretion. As diseased cats can transmit the infection to naïve contact animals, the epidemiological role of H5N1-infected cats in endemically infected areas as a link between wild birds, poultry and humans needs close inspection, and vaccination of cats should be considered to reduce possible human exposure. © 2008 SGM.",2008

In both chickens and ducks, the virus has been demonstrated to replicate in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. Experimentally, H5N1 HPAI virus has been transmitted to chickens through the consumption of raw infected meat. In this study, we investigated virus replication in cardiac and skeletal muscle and in the trachea of chickens after experimental intranasal inoculation with the H5N1 HPAI virus. The virus was detected in tissues by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and virus isolation, and in the trachea by RRT-PCR and a commercial avian influenza (AI) viral antigen detection test. A modified RNA extraction protocol was developed for rapid detection of the virus in tissues by RRT-PCR. The H5N1 HPAI virus was sporadically detected in meat and the tracheas of infected birds without any clinical sign of disease as early as 6 hr postinfection (PI), and was detected in all samples tested at 24 hr PI and later. No differences in sensitivity were seen between virus isolation and RRT-PCR in meat samples. The AI viral antigen detection test on tracheal swabs was a useful method for identifying infected chickens when they were sick or dead, but was less sensitive in detecting infected birds when they were preclinical. This study provides data indicating that preslaughter tracheal swab testing can identify birds infected with HPAI among the daily mortality and prevent infected flocks from being sent to processing plants. In addition, the modified RNA extraction and RRT-PCR test on meat samples provide a rapid and sensitive method of identifying HPAI virus in illegal contraband or domestic meat samples.",2008

Differences in pathogenicity between four of these viruses as well as the effect of host age on the outcome of infection were studied in ducks. Three of the viruses were highly lethal in 2-week-old ducks and induced severe neurological dysfunction. Neurological signs were also observed in 5-week-old ducks inoculated with one of these viruses; however mortality was low. The fourth virus studied did not induce neurological signs in 2-week-old ducks, but did produce moderate mortality. This virus caused no clinical signs or death in 5-week-old ducks. All viruses studied were isolated from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs, and also from brain, heart, lung and muscle tissues, demonstrating systemic infection. All viruses evaluated transmitted efficiently to contact ducks. Phylogenetic analysis of the viruses studied and other Asian H5N1 HPAI viruses with diverse pathogenicity in ducks, showed changes in several genes, but none clearly associated with pathogenicity. In conclusion, the pathogenicity of circulating H5N1 HPAI viruses in ducks varies depending on the virus strain and the age of the duck and correlates with the level of viral replication in tissues. High titers of virus in organs, high viral shedding, and variable mortality enable ducks to circulate H5N1 HPAI viruses.",2007

Vaccine candidates of influenza A viruses of H5N1 subtype have been generated in several laboratories by plasmid-based reverse genetics with hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes from the epidemic strains of avian viruses in a background of internal genes from the vaccine donor strain of human strains, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8). These reassortant viruses containing genes from both avian and human viruses might impose biosafety concerns, also may be do if C4/F AIV would be a live attenuated vaccine or cold-adaptive strain vaccine. In order to generate better and safer vaccine candidate viruses, we genetically constructed attenuated reassortant H5N1 influenza A virus, designated as C4/F AIV, by plasmid-based reverse genetics with all eight genes from the avian strains. The C4/F AIV virus contained HA and NA genes from an epidemic strain A/Chicken/Huadong/04 (H5N1) (C4/H5N1) in a background of internal genes derived from a low pathogenic strain of A/Chicken/F/98(H9N2). The reassortant virus was attenuated by removal of the multibasic amino acid motif in the HA gene by mutation and deletion (from PQRERRRKKR↓G to PQIETR↓G). The intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of C4/F AIV virus was 0, whereas that of the donor virus C4/H5N1 was 3.0.

Phylogenetic analysis and pairwise comparison of nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that the virus displayed high similarity to the H5N1 viruses circulating in Asia during 2004 and 2005. The hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the virus contained multiple basic amino acid residues (-RERRRKR-) adjacent to the cleavage site between the HA1 and HA2 domains, showing the highly pathogenic (HP) characteristics. The HP phenotype was confirmed by experimental infection of chickens, which led up to 100% mortality within 24-72 h postinfection. The virus replicated equally well in the majority of organs of the infected chickens with titers ranging from 107.5 to 104.7 50% embryo lethal dose (ELD50) per gram of tissue. In a mouse model the virus exhibits low pathogenic characteristics with a lethal infection observed only after applying high inoculating dose (≥107.6 ELD50) of the virus. The infectious virus particles were recovered only from the pulmonary system including trachea and lungs.

Further genetic modifications were introduced into the PB1 gene to enhance the attenuated (att) phenotype of the virus in vivo.

In chickens, a vaccination scheme consisting of a single dose of an att H7N2 vaccine virus at 2 weeks of age and subsequent challenge with the wild-type H7N2 LPAI virus resulted in complete protection. We further extended our vaccination strategy against the HPAI H5N1. In this case, we reconstituted an att H5N1 vaccine virus, whose HA and NA genes were derived from an Asian H5N1 virus. A single-dose immunization in ovo with the att H5N1 vaccine virus in 18-day-old chicken embryos resulted in more than 60% protection for 4-week-old chickens and 100% protection for 9- to 12-week-old chickens. Boosting at 2 weeks posthatching provided 100% protection against challenge with the HPAI H5N1 virus for chickens as young as 4 weeks old, with undetectable virus shedding postchallenge.

Therefore, vaccines encoding NA antigen (e.g., DNA and alphavirus-based virus like replicon particles (VRP)) or baculovirus-expressed recombinant NA (rN2) were tested for their ability to protect against highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) in chickens. Vaccination with A/Pheasant/Maryland/4457/93 (Ph/MD) rN2 protein produced significantly higher levels of NA-inhibition (NI) activity and 88% protection from HPAI H5N2 challenge than vaccination with Ph/MD N2 DNA (25% protection). Vaccination with Ph/MD N2 VRP a minimum of two times also produced high levels of NI activity and protection against HPAI challenge (63% protection). Vaccination with VRP encoding an N2 gene that was genetically distant from the challenge virus N2 failed to protect chickens. Vaccines producing higher levels of NI activity conferred partial protection, but failed to affect viral shedding. Consideration of the homology between vaccine and challenge virus isolate NA genes may provide improved immunity if high levels of NI activity are obtained. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Although these infections document the susceptibility of wild birds to H5N1 HPAI viruses and the spillover of these viruses from infected domestic birds to wild birds, it is unknown whether H5N1 HPAI viruses can persist in free-living avian populations. In a previous study, we established that wood ducks (Aix sponsa) are highly susceptible to infection with H5N1 HPAI viruses. To quantify this susceptibility and further evaluate the likelihood of H5N1 HPAI viral maintenance in a wild bird population, we determined the concentration of virus required to produce infection in wood ducks. To accomplish this, 25 wood ducks were inoculated intranasally at 12-16 wk of age with decreasing concentrations of a H5N1 HPAI virus (A/Whooper Swan/Mongolia/244/05 [H5N1]). The median infections dose and the lethal dose of H5N1 HPAI virus in wood ducks were very low (100.95 and 101.71 median embryo infectious dose [EID50]/ml, respectively) and less than that of chickens (102.80 and 102.80 EID50 /ml). These results confirm that wood ducks are highly susceptible to infection with H5N1 HPAI virus. The data from this study, combined with what is known experimentally about H5N1 HPAI virus infection in wood ducks and viral persistence in aquatic environments, suggest that the wood duck would represent a sensitive indicator species for H5N1 HPAI. Results also suggest that the potential for decreased transmission efficiency associated with reduced viral shedding (especially from the cloaca) and a loss of environmental fitness (in water), may be offset by the ability of this virus to be transmitted through a very low infectious dose. © Wildlife Disease Association 2007.",2007

The chickens demonstrated anorexia, depression, and 100% mortality within 2 days postinoculation. Three of the pigeons died after a history of depression and severe neurological signs consisting of paresis to paralysis, mild enteric hemorrhage, resulting in a mortality of 21%. Gross lesions in these pigeons were mild and inconsistent. Occasionally subcutaneous hyperemia and hemorrhage and cerebral malacia were observed. Microscopic lesions and detection of viral antigen were confined to the central nervous system of these pigeons. In the cerebrum and to a minor extent in the brain stem a lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalitis with disseminated neuronal and glial cell necrosis, perivascular cuffing, glial nodules, and in one bird focally extensive liquefactive necrosis could be observed.

Although vaccination of poultry against avian influenza provides a potentially attractive control measure, little is known about the effect of vaccination on epidemiologically relevant parameters, such as transmissibility and the infectious period. We used transmission experiments to study the effect of vaccination on the transmission characteristics of HPAI A/Chicken/Netherlands/03 H7N7 in chickens. In the experiments, a number of infected and uninfected chickens is housed together and the infection chain is monitored by virus isolation and serology. Analysis is based on a stochastic susceptible, latently infected, infectious, recovered (SEIR) epidemic model. We found that vaccination is able to reduce the transmission level to such an extent that a major outbreak is prevented, important variables being the type of vaccine (H7N1 or H7N3) and the moment of challenge after vaccination. Two weeks after vaccination, both vaccines completely block transmission. One week after vaccination, the H7N1 vaccine is better than the H7N3 vaccine at reducing the spread of the H7N7 virus. We discuss the implications of these findings for the use of vaccination programs in poultry and the value of transmission experiments in the process of choosing vaccine. © 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",2005

Virus was not detected in blood, bone marrow, or breast and thigh meat, and feeding breast and thigh meat from virus-infected birds did not transmit the virus.

Feeding breast or thigh meat from HPAI (H5N2) virus-infected chickens to other chickens did not transmit the infection. However, A/chicken/Korea/ES/2003 (H5N1) HPAI virus produced high titers of virus in the breast meat, and feeding breast meat from these infected chickens to other chickens resulted in AI virus infection and death. Usage of either recombinant fowlpox vaccine with H5 AI gene insert or inactivated AI whole-virus vaccines prevented HPAI virus in breast meat.

Here, we demonstrate that H5N1 influenza viruses, isolated from apparently healthy domestic ducks in mainland China from 1999 through 2002, were becoming progressively more pathogenic for mammals, and we present a hypothesis explaining the mechanism of this evolutionary direction. Twenty-one viruses isolated from apparently healthy ducks in southern China from 1999 through 2002 were confirmed to be H5N1 subtype influenza A viruses. These isolates are antigenically similar to A/Goose/Guangdong/1/96 (H5N1) virus, which was the source of the 1997 Hong Kong ""bird flu"" hemagglutinin gene, and all are highly pathogenic in chickens. The viruses form four pathotypes on the basis of their replication and lethality in mice. There is a clear temporal pattern in the progressively increasing pathogenicity of these isolates in the mammalian model. Five of six H5N1 isolates tested replicated in inoculated ducks and were shed from trachea or cloaca, but none caused disease signs or death. Phylogenetic analysis of the full genome indicated that most of the viruses are reassortants containing the A/Goose/Guangdong/1/ 96-like hemagglutinin gene and the other genes from unknown Eurasian avian influenza viruses. This study is a characterization of the H5N1 avian influenza viruses recently circulating in ducks in mainland China.

Per group, five chickens inoculated with HPAI A/Chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/83 H5N2 virus were placed 1 day post-inoculation (p.i.) in one cage with five contact chickens. Inoculated and contact chickens were treated twice daily from 1 day before inoculation up to day 7 p.i. All untreated inoculated and contact chickens became infected and four inoculated and two contact chickens died. Similarly, all of the zanamivir-treated inoculated and contact chickens became infected and all inoculated and four contact chickens died. Obviously, locally active zanamivir has no effect. In contrast, although oseltamivir could not prevent tracheal infection of the inoculated chickens, none had an infected cloaca and only one died. More important, only after stopping treatment three contact chickens became positive, suggesting limited transmission within or after the treatment period. In conclusion, treatment with systemically active oseltamivir limits to a large extent a severe outcome and chicken-to-chicken transmission of HPAI virus. © 2003, Elsevier B.V.",2004

All chickens inoculated with H7N3/HP AI virus became infected and abruptly died 2 or 3 days postinoculation, but a few showed moderate depression before death. The H7N3/HP AI virus produced focal hemorrhages of the comb, petechial hemorrhage at the esophageal- proventricular junction and proventricular mucosa, edema and congestion of the lung, petechiation of the spleen, and generalized decrease in body fat. Histologically, severe necrosis, hemorrhage, and inflammation were primarily identified in lungs and the lymphoid tissues. All tissues sampled from the H7N3/HP AI group were positive for the AI viral antigen, predominantly in endothelium of blood vessels throughout most tissues and less frequently in histiocytes and cellular debris of lymphoid tissues. Even less consistently, cardiac myocytes, hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, glandular epithelial cells, microglial cells, and neurons became infected. These studies suggest the Chilean H7N3/LP AI virus was poorly infectious for chickens and may have been recently introduced from a nongalliform host. By contrast, the H7N3/HP AI virus was highly infectious and lethal for chickens. The H7N3/HP AI virus had a strong tropism for the cardiovascular system, principally vascular endothelium, which is similar to the viral tropism demonstrated previously with other H5 and H7 HPAI viruses. Interestingly, the H7N3/LP AI virus on intravenous inoculation replicated in cardiac myocytes, a feature of HPAI and not LPAI viruses, which further supports the theory that the H7N3/LP AI virus was in transition from LP to HP.",2004

In the experiments, five inoculated animals are placed in a cage with five contact animals, and the infection chain is monitored by taking blood samples, and samples from the trachea and cloaca. The data are analysed by final size methods and a generalized linear model. The results show that HPAI virus is more infectious and induces a longer infectious period than LPAI. In fact, fully susceptible animals are invariably infected when confronted with HPAI virus and die within six days after infection. Animals previously infected with LPAI virus, on the other hand, survive an infection with HPAI virus or escape infection all together. This implies that a previous infection with LPAI virus effectively reduces susceptibility of the host to infection and decreases transmission of HPAI virus.

The objective of this study was to ascertain the susceptibility of emus (Dramaius novaehollandiae), domestic geese (Anser anser domesticus), domestic ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), and pigeons (Columba livia) to intranasal (i.n.) inoculation with the A/chicken/Hong Kong/220/97 (H5N1) highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. No mortality occurred within 10 days postinoculation (DPI) in the four species investigated, and clinical disease, evident as neurologic dysfunction, was observed exclusively in emus and geese. Grossly, pancreatic mottling and splenomegaly were identified in these two species. In addition, the geese had cerebral malacia and thymic and bursal atrophy. Histologically, both the emus and geese developed pancreatitis, meningoencephalitis, and mild myocarditis. Influenza viral antigen was demonstrated in areas with histologic lesions up to 10 DPI in the geese. Virus was reisolated from oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and from the lung, brain, and kidney of the emus and geese. Moderate splenomegaly was observed grossly in the ducks. Viral infection of the ducks was pneumotropic, as evidenced by mild inflammatory lesions in the respiratory tract and virus reisolation from oropharyngeal swabs and from a lung. Pigeons were resistant to HK/220 infection, lacking gross and histologic lesions, viral antigen, and reisolation of virus. These results imply that emus and geese are susceptible to i.n. inoculation with the HK/220 virus, whereas ducks and pigeons are more resistant. These latter two species probably played a minimal epidemiologic role in the perpetuation of the H5N1 Hong Kong-origin influenza viruses.",2002

Vector species involved in LSDV transmission and their ability to acquire and transmit the virus are poorly characterized. Using a highly representative bovine experimental model of lumpy skin disease, we fed four model vector species (Aedes aegypti, Culex quinquefasciatus, Stomoxys calcitrans, and Culicoides nubeculosus) on LSDV-inoculated cattle in order to examine their acquisition and retention of LSDV. Subclinical disease was a more common outcome than clinical disease in the inoculated cattle. Importantly, the probability of vectors acquiring LSDV from a subclinical animal (0.006) was very low compared with that from a clinical animal (0.23), meaning an insect feeding on a subclinical animal was 97% less likely to acquire LSDV than one feeding on a clinical animal. All four potential vector species studied acquired LSDV from the host at a similar rate, but Aedes aegypti and Stomoxys calcitrans retained the virus for a longer time, up to 8 days. There was no evidence of virus replication in the vector, consistent with mechanical rather than biological transmission. The parameters obtained in this study were combined with data from studies of LSDV transmission and vector life history parameters to determine the basic reproduction number of LSDV in cattle mediated by each of the model species. This reproduction number was highest for Stomoxys calcitrans (19.1), followed by C. nubeculosus (7.1) and Ae. aegypti (2.4), indicating that these three species are potentially efficient transmitters of LSDV; this information can be used to inform LSD control programs.IMPORTANCE Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) causes a severe systemic disease characterized by cutaneous nodules in cattle. LSDV is a rapidly emerging pathogen, having spread since 2012 into Europe and Russia and across Asia. The vector-borne nature of LSDV transmission is believed to have promoted this rapid geographic spread of the virus; however, a lack of quantitative evidence about LSDV transmission has hampered effective control of the disease during the current epidemic. Our research shows subclinical cattle play little part in virus transmission relative to clinical cattle and reveals a low probability of virus acquisition by insects at the preclinical stage. We have also calculated the reproductive number of different insect species, therefore identifying efficient transmitters of LSDV. This information is of utmost importance, as it will help to define epidemiological control measures during LSDV epidemics and of particular consequence in resource-poor regions where LSD vaccination may be less than adequate.

To prevent type Asia1 FMD in eastern Asia, two vaccine strains (ASM-R: G–V and ASM-SM: G–V/Shamir fusion) were developed and tested against type Asia1 virus strains. After immunization with the two experimental vaccines, the ASM-SM strain showed a higher level of protection against Shamir virus in mice. Additional immunogenicity tests were carried out in cattle and pigs, revealing sufficient antibody production capable of protecting the animals against the viral challenge. In cattle, the immune response started just 2 weeks after vaccination. Immunogenicity was lower in pigs, but antibody production was greatly increased to a high level after a second vaccination round. In particular, herein, 60 % and 100 % of the vaccinated pigs challenged with the Asia1 Shamir virus were determined to be clinically protected after one and two vaccination rounds with ASM-R, respectively. Pigs vaccinated twice produced sufficient antibody titers with low virus shedding for short time. Moreover, ASM-SM single-vaccinated pigs showed 100 % protection when challenged with the Asia1 Shamir virus.

Previously, we showed that the genetic diversity of FMDV plays an important role in virulence in suckling mice. Here, we mutated the amino acid residue Phe257, located in the finger domain of FMDV polymerase and conserved across FMDV serotypes, to a cysteine (F257C) to study the relationship between viral genetic diversity, virulence, and transmissibility in natural hosts. The single amino acid substitution in FMDV polymerase resulted in a high-fidelity virus variant, rF257C, with growth kinetics indistinguishable from those of wild-type (WT) virus in cell culture, but it displayed smaller plaques and impaired fitness in direct competition assays. Furthermore, we found that rF257C was attenuated in vivo in both suckling mice and pigs (one of its natural hosts). Importantly, contact exposure experiments showed that the rF257C virus exhibited reduced transmissibility compared to that of wild-type FMDV in the porcine model. This study provides evidence that FMDV genetic diversity is important for viral virulence and transmissibility in susceptible animals. Given that type O FMDV exhibits the highest genetic diversity among all seven serotypes of FMDV, we propose that the lower polymerase fidelity of the type O FMDV could contribute to its dominance worldwide. IMPORTANCE Among the seven serotypes of FMDV, serotype O FMDV have the broadest distribution worldwide, which could be due to their high virulence and transmissibility induced by high genetic diversity. In this paper, we generated a single amino acid substitution FMDV variant with a high-fidelity polymerase associated with viral fitness, virulence, and transmissibility in a natural host. The results highlight that maintenance of viral population diversity is essential for interhost viral spread. This study provides evidence that higher genetic diversity of type O FMDV could increase both virulence and transmissibility, thus leading to their dominance in the global epidemic.

Sheep inoculated with SPPV showed no clinical signs, only a very small number of genome-positive samples and a low-level antibody reaction. In contrast, all GTPV inoculated or in-contact goats developed severe clinical signs with high viral genome loads observed in all tested matrices. Furthermore, seroconversion was detected in nearly all goats and no differences concerning the severity of the disease depending on the inoculation route were observed.

A GTPV isolate and a SPPV isolate were sequenced in a combined approach using nanopore MinION sequencing to obtain long reads and Illumina high throughput sequencing for short precise reads to gain full-length high-quality genome sequences. Concomitantly, sheep and goats were inoculated with SPPV and GTPV strains, respectively. During the animal trial, varying infection routes were compared: a combined intravenous and subcutaneous infection, an only intranasal infection, and the contact infection between naïve and inoculated animals. Sheep inoculated with SPPV showed no clinical signs, only a very small number of genome-positive samples and a low-level antibody reaction. In contrast, all GTPV inoculated or in-contact goats developed severe clinical signs with high viral genome loads observed in all tested matrices. Furthermore, seroconversion was detected in nearly all goats and no differences concerning the severity of the disease depending on the inoculation route were observed. Conclusively, the employed SPPV strain has the properties of an attenuated vaccine strain, consistent with the genetic data, whereas the GTPV strain represents a highly virulent field strain. © 2020 by the authors.

These traditional FMD vaccines are produced using large quantities of infectious, virulent, wild-type FMD viruses, with the associated risk of virus escape from manufacturing facilities or incomplete inactivation during the vaccine formulation process. While higher quality vaccines produced from wild-type FMDV are processed to reduce non-structural antigens, there is still a risk that small amounts of non-structural proteins may be present in the final product. A novel, antigenically marked FMD-LL3B3D vaccine platform under development by Zoetis, Inc. and the USDA-ARS, consists of a highly attenuated virus platform containing negative antigenic markers in the conserved non-structural proteins 3Dpol and 3B that render resultant vaccines fully DIVA compatible. This vaccine platform allows for the easy exchange of capsid coding sequences to create serotype-specific vaccines. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of the inactivated FMD-LL3B3D-A24 Cruzeiro vaccine in cattle against wild-type challenge with A24 Cruzerio. A proprietary adjuvant system was used to formulate the vaccines that conferred effective protection at low doses while maintaining the DIVA compatibility. In contrast to wild-type FMDV, the recombinant FMD-LL3B3D mutant viruses have been shown to induce no clinical signs of FMD and no shedding of virus in cattle or pigs when inoculated as a live virus. The FMD-LL3B3D vaccine platform, currently undergoing development in the US, provides opportunities for safer vaccine production with full DIVA compatibility in support of global FMDV control and eradication initiatives. © Copyright © 2020 Hardham, Krug, Pacheco, Thompson, Dominowski, Moulin, Gay, Rodriguez and Rieder.",2020

To our knowledge there is only a single study examining dose dependency, clinical course, viremia, virus shedding, as well as serological response following experimental LSDV “Neethling” inoculation. Here, we inoculated cattle with four different doses of LSDV strain “Macedonia2016”, a recently characterized virulent LSDV field strain, and examined clinical symptoms, viremia, viral shedding, and seroconversion. Interestingly, around 400 cell culture infectious dose50 (CCID50) of LSDV-“Macedonia2016” were sufficient to induce generalized Lumpy Skin Disease (LSD) in two out of six cattle but with a different incubation time, whereas the other animals of this group showed only a mild course of LSD. However, differences in incubation time, viral loads, serology, and in the clinical scoring could not be observed in the other three groups. In summary, we concluded that experimental LSDV infection of cattle with an infectious virus titer of 105 to 106 CCID50/mL of “Macedonia2016” provides a robust and sufficient challenge model for future studies. © 2020 by the authors.

However, simplifying assumptions and excessive use of proxy measures to compensate for gaps in available data may compromise modeled outcomes. The current investigation was prospectively designed to address two major gaps in current knowledge of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) pathogenesis in pigs: the end (duration) of the infectious period and the viability of FMDV in decaying carcasses. By serial exposure of sentinel groups of pigs to the same group of donor pigs infected by FMDV A24 Cruzeiro, it was demonstrated that infected pigs transmitted disease at 10 days post infection (dpi), but not at 15 dpi. Assuming a latent period of 1 day, this would result in a conservative estimate of an infectious duration of 9 days, which is considerably longer than suggested by a previous report from an experiment performed in cattle. Airborne contagion was diminished within two days of removal of infected pigs from isolation rooms. FMDV in muscle was inactivated within 7 days in carcasses stored at 4oC. By contrast, FMDV infectivity in vesicle epithelium harvested from intact carcasses stored under similar conditions remained remarkably high until the study termination at 11 weeks post mortem. The output from this study consists of experimentally determined data on contagion associated with FMDV-infected pigs. This information may be utilized to update parameterization of models used for foot-and-mouth disease outbreak simulations involving areas of substantial pig production. © Copyright © 2020 Stenfeldt, Bertram, Smoliga, Hartwig, Delgado and Arzt.",2020

Its impact can be avoided or minimized if the virus is detected early. FMDV detection relies on vesicular fluid, epithelial tags, swabs, serum, and other sample types from live animals. These samples might not always be available, necessitating the use of alternative sample types. Meat juice (MJ), collected after freeze-thaw cycles of skeletal muscle, is a potential sample type for FMDV detection, especially when meat is illegally imported. We have performed experiments to evaluate the suitability of MJ for FMDV detection. MJ was collected from pigs that were experimentally infected with FMDV. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from MJ, sera, oral swabs, and lymph nodes from the same animals and tested for FMDV by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). MJ was also tested for FMDV antigen by Lateral Flow Immunoassay (LFI). FMDV RNA was detected in MJ by rRT-PCR starting at one day post infection (DPI) and as late as 21 DPI. In contrast, FMDV RNA was detected in sera at 1–7 DPI. Antigen was also detected in MJ at 1–9 DPI by LFI. Live virus was not isolated directly from MJ, but was recovered from the viral genome by transfection into susceptible cells. The data show that MJ is a good sample type for FMDV detection. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2020

Since the distribution range of both diseases is similar in Africa, it makes sense to use a bivalent vaccine to control them. This may lead to the more consistent and sustainable use of vaccination against Rift Valley fever through a more cost-effective vaccine. In this study, a recombinant lumpy skin disease virus was constructed in which the thymidine kinase gene was used as the insertion site for the Gn and Gc protective glycoprotein genes of Rift Valley fever virus using homologous recombination. Selection markers, the enhanced green fluorescent protein and Escherichia coli guanidine phosphoribosyl transferase (gpt), were used for selection of recombinant virus and in a manner enabling a second recombination event to occur upon removal of the gpt selection-pressure allowing the removal of both marker genes in the final product. This recombinant virus, LSD-RVF.mf, was selected to homogeneity, characterized and evaluated in cattle as a vaccine to show protection against both lumpy skin disease and Rift Valley fever in cattle.

As LSDV spreads into new regions, it is important that signs of disease are recognized promptly by animal caregivers. This study describes the gross, microscopic, and ultrastructural changes that occur over time in cattle experimentally challenged with LSDV. Four calves were inoculated with wildtype LSDV and monitored for 19 to 21 days. At 7 days after inoculation, 2 of the 4 cattle developed multifocal cutaneous nodules characteristic of LSD. Some lesions displayed a targetoid appearance. Histologically, intercellular and intracellular edema was present in the epidermis of some nodules. Occasional intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were identified in keratinocytes. More severe and consistent changes were present in the dermis, with marked histiocytic inflammation and necrotizing fibrinoid vasculitis of dermal vessels, particularly the deep dermal plexus. Chronic lesions consisted of full-thickness necrosis of the dermis and epidermis. Lesions in other body organs were not a major feature of LSD in this study, highlighting the strong cutaneous tropism of this virus.

FMD virus (FMDV), the causative agent, initiates infection by interaction with integrin cellular receptors on pharyngeal epithelium cells, causing clinical signs one to four days after transmission to a susceptible host. However, some Southern African Territories (SAT) viruses have been reported to cause mild or subclinical infections that may go undiagnosed in field conditions and are likely to be more common than previously expected. The studies presented here demonstrate that not all SAT2 viruses are equally virulent in cattle. The two SAT2 viruses, ZIM/5/83 and ZIM/7/83, were both highly attenuated in cattle, as evidenced by the mild clinical signs observed after needle challenge, while two incongruent SAT2 viruses showed significantly different clinical signs in challenged cattle. We then explored the ability of the SAT2 viruses to infect different cell types with defined receptors that are utilised by FMDV and found differences in their ability to lyse cells in culture and to compete in a controlled cell culture environment. The population sequence variation between ZIM/5/83 and ZIM/7/83 revealed multiple sites of single nucleotide variants of low frequency between the predominant virus populations, as could be expected from the genome of an RNA virus. An assessment of the biophysical stability of SAT2 virions during acidification indicated that the SAT2 virus EGY/09/12 was more resilient to acidification than the ZIM/5/83 and ZIM/7/83 viruses; however, whether this difference relates to differences in virulence in vivo is unclear.

The intra-serotype heterologous potency test resulted in an intra-serotype heterologous potency of 6.5 PD50 /dose. These data support previous studies showing that a high potency emergency vaccine can protect against clinical disease when challenged with a heterologous strain of the same serotype, indicating that not only the r1-value of the vaccine, but also the homologous potency of a vaccine should be taken into account when advising vaccines to control an outbreak. © 2020 by the authors.

A vaccination-challenge study was performed by using two emergency FMDV vaccines with A22 Iraq 64 (A22 IRQ) and A Malaysia 97 (A MAY 97) strains, against challenge with a variant strain of FMDV A/Asia/G-IX/SEA-97 lineage at 7- and 21-day post-vaccination (dpv). At 7 dpv, three of five female calves vaccinated with A MAY 97 and four of five vaccinated with A22 IRQ did not show lesions on the feet and were considered protected, while at 21 dpv all five calves were protected with each vaccine, indicating equal efficacy of both vaccine strains. Calves were protected despite relatively low heterologous neutralizing antibody titers to the challenge virus at the time of challenge. All the calves developed antibodies to the non-structural proteins, most likely due to the direct intradermolingual (IDL) inoculation. Only one calf from the A MAY 97-7 group had infectious virus in the serum 1–3-day post-challenge (dpc), while no virus could be isolated from the serum of cattle challenged on 21 dpv. The virus could be isolated from the oral swabs of all calves, 1–7 dpc with viral RNA detected 1–10 dpc. Nasal swabs were positive for virus 1–6 dpc in a small number of calves. The time between vaccination and infection did not have an impact on the number of animals with persistent infection, with almost all the animals showing viral RNA in their oro-pharyngeal fluid (probang) samples up to 35 dpc. Despite the poor in vitro matching data and field reports of vaccine failures, this study suggests that these vaccine strains should be effective against this new A/Asia/G/SEA-97 variant, provided they are formulated with a high antigen dose. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, the efficacy of the O SKR 7/10 vaccine was evaluated by challenge with the FMD virus (FMDV) O/Jincheon/SKR/2014 (O Jincheon), which has the same O/SEA/Mya-98 lineage as the O/SKR/7/10 strain that was isolated in 2010 in South Korea, in FMD-seronegative pigs. Full protection against the O Jincheon virus was demonstrated as early as 14 days postvaccination, which was explained by the strong serological relationship (r1 value: ≥ 0.92) between the O Jincheon and O SKR 2010 viruses. However, in the field trial, no satisfactory serological elevations against FMDV were observed, even in the double-vaccinated groups. Therefore, it can be concluded that the O SKR 7/10 vaccine may need to be improved to overcome the interference effects from the high levels of maternally-derived antibodies generated due to the mandatory nationwide vaccination of sows in South Korea. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020

To this end, this study aimed to develop a FMD vaccine utilizing O PanAsia-2 that is able to provide broad protection against ME-SA as the vaccine strain, with a focus on the O/Jincheon/SKR/2014 virus (SEA topotype), the outbreaks of which have persisted in spite of the enforcement of FMD vaccination. The virus neutralizing antibody (VN) titer to the ME-SA topotype (especially, Ind2001 lineage) virus in pigs was the highest, followed by SEA, while the VN titers to the Cathay and EURO-SA topotypes were similar. In the O/Jincheon/SKR/2014 virus challenge test, all pigs were protected against the virus, and almost no virus shedding was detected after the virus challenge. In the immunization test performed on cattle and pigs, antibodies with sufficient protective activity were produced in cattle two weeks after the first immunization, and pigs exhibited lower immunity compared to cattle. However, immunity was improved enough in pigs to provide protection against the virus challenge after the second immunization, with a significant increase in antibody production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2020

There is little recorded information on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the disease in deer in that outbreak. In this experimental study, we compared the susceptibility of mule deer to FMD virus (FMDV) serotype O to that of cattle (Bos taurus). We also determined the potential for intra-and interspecies transmission of FMDV serotype O in mule deer and cattle, and assessed conventional laboratory tests in their ability to detect FMDV in mule deer. Two mule deer and one steer were each infected by intraepithelial tongue inoculation with 10,000 bovine tongue infective doses of FMDV, strain O1 Manisa. The inoculated steer and deer were kept in the same room with contact animals of both species. Exposed contact animals were moved to rooms with unexposed animals after becoming febrile. All mule deer (n=14) and cattle (n=6) developed clinical signs and lesions consistent with FMDV infection. Deer had a high prevalence of myocarditis and high mortality. Virus was transmitted between mule deer, from cattle to mule deer, and from mule deer to cattle.

Indirect transmission facilitates spread from multiple sources beyond the infectious host, complicating the epidemiology and control of these diseases. This study carried out a series of transmission experiments to determine the dose-response relationship between environmental contamination and transmission of FMDV in cattle from measurements of viral shedding and rates of environmental contamination and survival. Seven out of ten indirect exposures resulted in successful transmission. The basic reproduction number for environmental transmission of FMDV in this experimental setting was estimated at 1.65, indicating that environmental transmission alone could sustain an outbreak. Importantly, detection of virus in the environment prior to the appearance of clinical signs in infected cattle and successful transmission from these environments highlights there is a risk of environmental transmission even before foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is clinically apparent in cattle. Estimated viral decay rates suggest that FMDV remained viable in this environment for up to 14 days, emphasizing the requirement for stringent biosecurity procedures fol-lowing outbreaks of FMD and the design of control measures that reflect the biology of a pathogen. IMPORTANCE Effective control of a disease relies on comprehensive understanding of how transmission occurs, in order to design and apply effective control measures. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is primarily spread by direct contact between infected and naive individuals, although the high levels of virus shed by infected animals mean that virus can also be spread through contact with contaminated environments. Using a series of transmission experiments, we demonstrate that environmental transmission alone would be sufficient to sustain an outbreak. Key observations include that a risk of transmission exists before clinical signs of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) are apparent in cattle and that survival of virus in the environment extends the transmission risk period. This study highlights the role a contaminated environment can play in the transmission of FMDV and presents approaches that can also be applied to study the transmission of other pathogens that are able to survive in the environment. © 2020 Colenutt et al.",2020

High titers of ELISA and neutralizing antibodies against FMDV were detectable at day 15 post-immunization. Likewise, activated T cells and induced IFN-γ response to in vitro recall with FMDV peptides were also detected by the same day. Further, in 70% of B2T-vaccinated pigs, full protection—no clinical signs of disease—was observed upon virus challenge at day 25 post-immunization.

Especially SAT2 have spread to Arabian Peninsula and the Palestinian Autonomous Territories. Of these viruses, the incidence of SAT2 is the highest. It is important to prepare for the spread of the virus to other continents, even though most FMD viruses are bovine-derived. In particular, due to the high breeding density of pigs in Asia, more attention is usually paid to the immunity and protection of pigs than cattle. For this reason, this study investigated the immunity and protection of pigs against the SAT viruses. Methods: Specific vaccines were developed for SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3 serotypes. These vaccine viruses were designed to be distinguished from the wild-type strain. An immunogenicity test was conducted using these vaccines in both cattle (n = 5/group) and pigs (n = 20/group). Results: High virus-neutralizing titer of antibodies (> 1:100) was induced in only 2 weeks after the immunization of cattle with the individual vaccine for SAT1, SAT2 or SAT3, and a clear immune response was induced after the second immunization in pigs. When the vaccinated pigs (n = 4-5/group) were challenged by the homologous wild-type virus strain 4 weeks after immunization, all the pigs were protected from the challenge. Conclusions: This study confirmed that these vaccines can be used against SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3 viruses in cattle and pigs. The vaccine strains developed in this study are expected to be used as vaccines that can protect against FMD in the event of a future FMD outbreak in pigs in consideration of the situation in Asia. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019

However, in contrast to cattle and pigs, the pathogenesis of FMDV in small ruminants has been incompletely elucidated. The objective of the current investigation was to characterize tissue- and cellular tropism of early and late stages of FMDV infection in sheep following three different routes of simulated natural virus exposure. Extensive post-mortem harvest of tissue samples at pre-determined time points during early infection (24 and 48 hours post infection) demonstrated that tissues specifically susceptible to primary FMDV infection included the paraepiglottic- and palatine tonsils, as well as the nasopharyngeal mucosa. Additionally, experimental aerosol inoculation of sheep led to substantial virus replication in the lungs at 24-48 hours post-inoculation. During persistent infection (35 days post infection), the paraepiglottic- and palatine tonsils were the only tissues from which infectious FMDV was recovered. This is strikingly different from cattle, in which persistent FMDV infection has consistently been located to the nasopharyngeal mucosa. Analysis of tissue sections by immunomicroscopy revealed a strict epithelial tropism during both early and late phases of infection as FMDV was consistently localized to cytokeratin-expressing epithelial cells. This study expands upon previous knowledge of FMDV pathogenesis in sheep by providing detailed information on the temporo-anatomic distribution of FMDV in ovine tissues. Findings are discussed in relation to similar investigations previously performed in cattle and pigs, highlighting similarities and differences in FMDV pathogenesis across natural host species.

Our data show a high analytical sensitivity of both tested duplex real-time qPCR systems for the reliable distinction of LSDV field and vaccine strains. Moreover, the commercially available capripox double-antigen ELISA seems to be as specific as the SNT and therefore provides an excellent tool for rapid and simple serological examination of LSDV-vaccinated or infected cattle. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",2019

Several haematophagous arthropod species like dipterans and ticks are suspected to play a role in the transmission of LSDV. Few conclusive data are however available on the importance of biting flies and horseflies as potential vectors in LSDV transmission. Therefore an in vivo transmission study was carried out to investigate possible LSDV transmission by Stomoxys calcitrans biting flies and Haematopota spp. horseflies from experimentally infected viraemic donor bulls to acceptor bulls. LSDV transmission by Stomoxys calcitrans was evidenced in 3 independent experiments, LSDV transmission by Haematopota spp. was shown in one experiment. Evidence of LSD was supported by induction of nodules and virus detection in the blood of acceptor animals. Our results are supportive for a mechanical transmission of the virus by these vectors. © 2019, The Author(s).",2019

In particular, the type O FMD virus (FMDV) is a serotype that causes FMD outbreaks most frequently in the world. In recent years, Southeast Asia (SEA), Middle East-South Asia (ME-SA), and Cathay topotype-mediated FMD are prevalent in Asia, among which the SEA and ME-SA topotypes cause a majority of the outbreaks. The SEA topotype virus is more likely to infect both cattle and pigs simultaneously, thereby resulting in more severe damages; thus, it is necessary to study the protection ability of the candidate vaccines of this topotype after immunization. In this study, an experimental vaccine for pigs was produced using a vaccine strain that contains the structural protein of the O Taiwan97 strain, which was derived from the Cathay topotype, and its effect was evaluated. In the immunization test in pigs and cattle, the antibody titers were found to be elevated two weeks after immunization and very high titers of neutralizing antibodies were formed after four weeks. After the second inoculation, very high titers of neutralizing antibodies were produced in both species in the fourth week after immunization, and the antibodies maintained for up to six months and three months in cattle and pigs, respectively. No significant immunological difference in antibody production was observed in cattle and pigs. This study confirmed that complete protection from the challenge of the SEA topotype virus (O/Jincheon/SKR/2014), although the antibody titers against O/Jincheon/SKR/2014 strain were not that high, was achieved through immunization with the newly developed Cathay topotype vaccine in pigs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2019

Although type C foot-and-mouth disease (FMD)has not occurred anywhere worldwide since 2004, the antigen bank should be preserved in preparation for an unexpected outbreak. We therefore conducted experiments to develop inactivated vaccines that are safer and exhibit improved characteristics over existing vaccines. Our previous study showed that the replacement of the capsid-encoding gene (P1)from the vaccine strain O1 Manisa could be rescued successfully from the vaccine strains. In addition, novel point mutation in the 3C region in the virus genome, for induction of properties with low pathogenesis to create a safe vaccine, and 3B1B2 replacement, for differential diagnosis with the wild type virus, were performed. The modified FMD vaccine strain, C3 Resende-R, was shown to provide lower pathogenesis in young mice than the wild-type virus. To identify the immune responses after vaccination with 146S antigen (15 μg/mL/dose), we conducted a virus neutralization test using serum from pigs and cattle vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine. The neutralizing titers in the cattle were higher than those in the pigs and maintained mean antibody titers of around 1:100 until the end of the experiment. The vaccine showed protection capability of 16 PD50 against C3 Resende virus in the pigs. The replacement of the structural protein-coding gene for the new FMDV was a useful tool in the development of an effective vaccine candidate strain. This inactivated vaccine will be used for the establishment of a safe vaccine strain for the antigen bank. © 2019",2019

While vaccination is often effective at controlling viral spread, failures can occur due to strain mismatch or viral mutation. Foot and Mouth Disease Virus (FMDV) possesses a hypervariable region within the G-H Loop of VP1, a capsid protein commonly associated with virus neutralization. Here, we investigate the effect of replacement of the G-H loop hypervariable epitope with a xenoepitope from PRRS virus on the immunogenicity and efficacy of an adenovirus vectored FMDV vaccine (Ad5-FMD). Pigs were vaccinated with Ad5-FMD, the modified Ad5-FMDxeno, or PBS, followed by intradermal challenge with FDMV strain O1 Manisa at 21 days post-vaccination. While overall serum antibody titers were significantly higher in Ad5-FMDxeno vaccinated animals, neutralizing antibody titers were decreased in pigs that received Ad5-FMDxeno, when compared to those vaccinated with Ad5-FMD, prior to viral challenge, indicative of immune redirection away from VP1 towards non-neutralizing epitopes. As expected, animals vaccinated with unmodified Ad5-FMD were protected from lesions, fever, and viremia. In contrast, animals vaccinated with Ad5-FMDxeno developed clinical signs and viremia, but at lower levels than that observed in PBS-treated controls. No significant difference was found in nasal shedding of virions between the two Ad5-FMD vaccinated groups. This data suggests that the hypervariable epitope of the VP1 G-H loop contributes to protective immunity conferred by Ad5 vector-delivered FMD vaccines in swine, and cannot be substituted without a loss of immunogenicity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019

Because there was no solid evidence conclusively verifying the transmission mechanism in the field and LSDV viraemic animals with overt and asymptomatic presentation of disease and their products may represent a risk as an indirect transmission pathway. In this work, we used PCR positivity and infectivity in clinical and subclinical infection to evaluate the safety of meat and offal products from cows infected with the virulent LSDV strain Russia/Dagestan/2015. At day 21 post infection, seven of the 12 animals developed the generalized disease, and four animals became subclinically infected without apparent clinical signs. Upon examination and necropsy, the animals with the generalized disease had skin lesions; noticeably enlarged lymph nodes; and lesions in the lungs, trachea and testicles; whereas subclinically ill animals exhibited only enlarged lymph nodes and fever. For both disease presentations, testing of skeletal meat by PCR and virus isolation showed that the skeletal meat did not contain live virus or viral genome, whereas in cattle with generalized disease, meat with gross pathology physically connected under the site of a skin lesion was positive for the live virus. In subclinical infection, only enlarged lymph nodes carried the infectious virus, while the other internal organs tested in both types of disease manifestation were negative except for the testicles. Overall, our findings demonstrate that clinically and subclinically infected animals are reservoirs of live LSDV in lymph nodes and testicles, whereas deep skeletal meat in both types of infection do not carry live virus and the risk of transmission through this product seems very low. The detection of LSDV in testicular tissues in subclinically ill animals is concerning because of the potential to spread infection through contaminated semen. This aspect requires reconsideration of surveillance programmes to identify these Trojan horses of LSDV infection. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2019

The differences in severity among outbreaks might be ascribable to these differences in infectivity among FMDV strains. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying these differences, we estimated the infectivity of O/JPN/2000 and O/JPN/2010, which caused outbreaks of markedly different scales, in cell lines, Holstein cattle, and suckling mice. Viral growth of the two strains in cells was not remarkably different; however, O/JPN/ 2000 showed apparently low transmissibility in cattle. Mortality rates of suckling mice inoculated intraperitoneally with a 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) of 10 for O/JPN/2000 and O/JPN/2010 also differed, at 0% and 100%, respectively. To identify genes responsible for this difference in infectivity, genetic regions of the full-length cDNA of O/JPN/2010 were replaced with corresponding fragments of O/JPN/2000. A total of eight recombinant viruses were successfully recovered, and suckling mice were intraperitoneally inoculated. Strikingly, recombinants having either VP1 or 3D derived from O/JPN/2000 showed 0% mortality in suckling mice, whereas other recombinants showed 100% mortality. This finding indicates that VP1, the outermost component of the virus particle, and 3D, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, are individually involved in the virulence of O/JPN/2010. Three-dimensional structural analysis of VP1 confirmed that amino acid differences between the two strains were located mainly at the domain interacting with the cellular receptor. On the other hand, measurement of their mutation frequencies demonstrated that O/JPN/2000 had higher replication fidelity than O/JPN/2010. © 2019 Nishi et al.",2019

This study tested whether well-known chemicals used as RNA virus treatment agents had inhibitory effects on FMD viruses (FMDVs) and demonstrated that ribavirin showed antiviral effects against FMDV in vitro/in vivo. In addition, it was observed that combining the administration of the antiviral agents orally and complementary therapy with vaccines synergistically enhanced antiviral activity and preserved the survival rate and body weight in the experimental animals. Antiviral agents mixed with an adjuvant were inoculated intramuscularly along with the vaccines, thereby inhibiting virus replication after injection and verifying that it was possible to induce early protection against viral infection prior to immunity being achieved through the vaccine. Finally, pigs treated with antiviral agents and vaccines showed no clinical signs and had low virus excretion.

In vitro vaccine matching has shown a number of contemporary FMDV Asia-1 strains vary antigenically to the Asia-1 Shamir vaccine strain, which could result in poor protection with use of this vaccine. Therefore it was important to test the ability of the Asia-1 Shamir vaccine to protect sheep from challenge with a recent, heterologous strain at different days post-vaccination (dpv), including in an emergency vaccination scenario (challenge 4 or 7 dpv). Sheep (5 per group) were challenged with the Asia-1/PAK/19/2014 isolate by intra-nasopharyngeal instillation 21 (V21), 7 (V7) or 4 (V4) dpv with high-potency (&gt;6 PD50) Asia-1 Shamir vaccine. An additional five sheep were mock-vaccinated with adjuvant only (antigen-free preparation) 4 days prior to challenge (A4), and five unvaccinated (UV) control sheep were also challenged. All V21, V7 and V4 sheep were protected from clinical FMD. Eighty percent of V21 sheep and 40% of V7 sheep had sterile immunity, however all V4 sheep became systemically infected. Vaccination reduced excretion of virus in nasal and oral secretions but had no effect on the development of persistent infection. All A4 sheep and UV control sheep developed clinical FMD. The high-potency Asia-1 Shamir vaccine will protect against disease should an outbreak of contemporary Asia-1 viruses occur. Intranasopharyngeal instillation is an effective challenge method for use in vaccine efficacy studies in sheep. © 2018",2018

However, the epidemiological significance of these FMD virus (FMDV) carriers is uncertain. In the current investigation, the contagion associated with FMDV carrier cattle was investigated by exposure of susceptible cattle and pigs to oropharyngeal fluid (OPF) samples or tissues harvested from persistently infected cattle. Naive cattle were inoculated through intranasopharyngeal deposition of unprocessed OPF samples that had been collected from FMDV carriers at 30 days postinfection. These inoculated cattle developed clinical FMD, and the severity of disease they developed was similar to that of animals that had been infected with a high-titer inoculum. In contrast, pigs exposed via intraoropharyngeal inoculation of the same OPF samples or via ingestion of nasopharyngeal tissues harvested from the same cohort of persistently infected cattle did not develop FMD. These findings indicate that there is demonstrable contagion associated with FMDV carrier cattle despite the lack of evidence for transmission by direct contact.

Four milking Jersey cows were infected via direct-contact with two non-milking Jersey cows that had been previously inoculated with FMD virus (FMDV: isolate O/UKG/34/2001). Milk and blood were collected throughout the course of infection to compare two high-throughput real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) protocols with different RT-PCR chemistries. Using both methods, FMDV was detected in milk by rRT-PCR one to two days before the presentation of characteristic foot lesions, similar to detection by virus isolation. Furthermore, rRT-PCR detection from milk was extended, up to 28 days post contact (dpc), compared to detection by virus isolation (up to 14 dpc). Additionally, the detection of FMDV in milk by rRT-PCR was possible for 18 days longer than detection by the same method in serum samples. FMDV was also detected with both rRT-PCR methods in milk samples collected during the UK 2007 outbreak. Dilution studies were undertaken using milk from the field and experimentally-infected animals, where for one sample it was possible to detect FMDV at 10−7. Based on the peak CT values detected in this study, these findings indicate that it could be possible to identify one acutely-infected milking cow in a typical-sized dairy herd (100–1000 individuals) using milk from bulk tanks or milk tankers.

This is of particular importance considering that the clinical manifestation of LSD is often mild making early disease detection challenging under the above-mentioned conditions. Building on positive experiences of group-level oral fluid sampling for pathogen detection as it is known to work for swine herds and wild boar, the concept was transferred to ruminants. Two groups of six cattle were infected experimentally with Lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) under controlled conditions. Blood as well as oropharyngeal and nasal swab samples were collected at regular intervals. Group samples were obtained by placing cotton gauze around a salt lick block provided commonly as dietary supplement. Pieces of the gauze with visible signs of manipulation were tested in parallel to samples obtained from individual animals. Genome load analysis by qPCR technology revealed LSDV detection window starting from day 2 post infection until day 28 post infection, the end of the animal trial. At the individual level, detection periods varied between animals and type of sample and included intermitted detection. The accumulative character of the alternative sampling method makes it suitable to detect LSDV DNA at group-level even at times of the infection where a selective sampling of individuals from a group – as normally done in LSD surveillance – would have most likely failed in the detection. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2018

In vitro vaccine matching data generated by the World Reference Laboratory (WRLFMD) indicated that A/ASIA/G-VII field viruses were poorly matched with vaccines (A-SAU-95, A22 IRQ and A-IRN-05) that are already used in the region. In order to assess the likely performance of one of these commercially available FMD vaccines, sixteen cattle were vaccinated with a polyvalent vaccine which contained two serotype A components (A-SAU-95 and A-IRN-05) with a homologous potency of at least 6PD50, and two cattle were left unvaccinated as controls. Twenty-one days later, all 18 cattle were challenged by tongue inoculation with an FMDV field isolate A/IRN/22/2015 from the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage, in line with the European Pharmacopeia PPG test conditions. The two control animals developed generalised FMD, and 7/16 vaccinated animals developed at least one foot lesion, thus only 56.3% were defined as protected. For the vaccine components, there was a significant increase in the probability of protection with increasing serological titres for A-SAU-95 (p = 0.03), but not for A-IRN-05 (p = 0.42). Analysis of FMDV in blood and nasal swabs suggested that vaccination reduced shedding and potential onward spread of FMD virus even if the animal developed foot lesions. In summary, the results from this study suggest that whilst this vaccine would not be appropriate for use in an emergency situation (in previously FMD-free countries), it may be partially effective in the field in endemic countries where repeat prophylactic vaccination is practiced. For emergency reactive vaccination, the findings from this study support the idea that a new vaccine strain should be developed that is tailored to the A/ASIA/G-VII lineage. © 2018 The Pirbright Institute",2018

The vaccine active ingredient is a replication-deficient human adenovirus serotype 5 vector encoding the FMD virus (FMDV) A24/Cruzeiro/BRA/55 capsid (AdtA24). In the first study, AdtA24 formulated in ENABL® adjuvant was compared to a fourfold higher dose of AdtA24 without adjuvant. Steers vaccinated with AdtA24 + ENABL® adjuvant developed a significantly higher virus neutralizing test (VNT) antibody titer and an improved clinical response following FMDV A24/Cruzeiro/BRA/55 intradermal lingual challenge at 14 days post-vaccination (dpv) than steers vaccinated with the active ingredient alone. In the second study, vaccination with AdtA24 formulated in ENABL® at the same dose used in the first study, followed by FMDV A24/Cruzeiro/BRA/55 challenge on 7 or 14 dpv, prevented clinical FMD in all steers and conferred 90% protection against viremia. In addition, post-challenge FMDV titers in nasal samples from vaccinated steers compared to unvaccinated steers were significantly reduced. In both studies, none of the AdtA24 vaccinated steers developed antibodies to the FMDV non-structural proteins prior to challenge with FMDV, indicative of the capacity to differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA).

This is especially so for serotypes O and SAT2 which are unstable in mildly acidic pH conditions or at elevated temperatures leading to dissociation of the capsid (146S particle) and loss of immunogenicity. Previously, stabilised SAT2 viruses were generated by reverse genetic approaches and assessed in vitro and in vivo with a guinea pig trial. Here we investigated the efficacy and comparative immunological responses of two thermostable and wild-type SAT2 vaccines over 5 months followed by challenge. We assessed humoral immune responses elicited in cattle in terms of total and neutralizing antibodies and IgG1/2 isotyping; and cell-mediated responses of IFN-γ as in vitro markers of protection. Whilst there were significant differences in total and neutralizing antibodies for the vSAT2-93H group compared to other vaccinated groups after the first vaccination, there were no significant differences after the second immunization. Following intra-dermolingual challenge all vaccinated groups were fully protected as determined by the absence of generalized lesions. These results provide proof that two vaccine doses, consisting of SAT2 antigen combined with ISA206B adjuvant, administered 4–6 weeks apart were able to protect animals up to 5 months pv. Additionally, vSAT2-93Y had significantly higher levels of IFN-γ after challenge and had a lower clinical score indicative of better protection compared to other vaccinated groups and the importance of cell mediated responses and antigen stability in protection. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017

High-potency O1 Manisa vaccine was previously shown to provide protection in cattle 21 days post vaccination (dpv) following challenge with a representative virus, O/SKR/2010. This study tested the ability of the O1 Manisa vaccine to protect cattle from infection and disease with the O/SKR/2010 virus within just 4 or 7 days post vaccination. The vaccine protected 50% of cattle from clinical disease when administered 7 days prior to challenge, but was not protective with just 4 days between vaccination and challenge. Viraemia was significantly reduced in animals challenged 7 dpv but not 4 dpv, compared to unvaccinated controls, however, there were no effects on the level of virus detected in nasal and oral secretions regardless of vaccination time. The level of neutralising antibodies detected in cattle challenged 7 dpv correlated with protection from clinical disease. All animals seroconverted to FMDV non-structural proteins, suggesting no sterile protection. An equal number of animals became persistently infected in both vaccine groups. The results indicated that high-potency O1 Manisa vaccine administered just 7 days prior to challenge should provide partial protection of cattle if an outbreak of O/SKR/2010, or related viruses, occurs, and would be useful to limit spread of FMDV when used in conjunction with other control measures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017

To determine the efficacy of a high potency (&gt;6PD50) FMD virus (FMDV) O1Manisa vaccine in sheep, we carried out a study using a heterologous FMDV (FMDV O/SKR/2010 - Mya-98 strain) challenge.

Infectious FMDV and viral RNA could be found in nasal swabs between 1 and 6 days post challenge (dpc) in most vaccinated sheep, but those vaccinated with higher doses or challenged at 14 dpv showed significant decreases in the level of FMDV detection. Intermittent virus shedding was noticed between 1 and 35 dpc in all vaccinated groups, but persistent infection could be demonstrated only in 4 sheep (20%). This study showed that at the recommended dose, a high potency (&gt;6 PD50) FMDV O1Manisa vaccine does not protect sheep against a heterologous challenge at 7 dpv.

With commercial inactivated FMD vaccines, the protection against FMD virus (FMDV) begins a minimum of 4 days post vaccination (dpv). Therefore, antiviral agents could be proposed for rapid protection and to reduce the spread of FMDV during outbreaks until vaccine-induced protective immunity occurs. In previous studies, we have developed two recombinant adenoviruses that simultaneously express porcine interferon-α and interferon-γ (Ad-porcine IFN-αγ) and multiple siRNAs that target the non-structural protein-regions of FMDV (Ad-3siRNA), and we have shown that the combination of the two antiviral agents (referred to here as Ad combination) induced robust protection against FMDV in pigs. In an attempt to provide complete protection against FMDV, we co-administered Ad combination and the FMD vaccine to mice and pigs. In the C57BL/6 mice model, we observed rapid and continuous protection against homologous FMDV challenge from 1 to 3 dpv—the period in which vaccine-mediated immunity is absent. In the pig experiments, we found that most of the pigs (five out of six) that received vaccine + Ad combination and were challenged with FMDV at 1 or 2 dpv were clinically protected from FMDV. In addition, most of the pigs that received vaccine + Ad combination and all pigs inoculated with the vaccine only were clinically protected from an FMDV challenge at 7 dpv. We believe that the antiviral agent ensures early protection from FMDV, and the vaccine participates in protection after 7 dpv. Therefore, we can say that the combination of the FMD vaccine and effective antiviral agents may offer both fast-acting and continuous protection against FMDV. In further studies, we plan to design coadministration of Ad combination and novel vaccines. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",2017

Construct 1, an optimized version of a previously used dendrimer, had four copies of a B-cell epitope derived from CSFV E2 glycoprotein connected to an also CSFV-derived T-cell epitope through maleimide instead of thioether linkages. Construct 2 was similarly built but included only two copies of the B-cell epitope, and in also bivalent construct 3 the CSFV T-cell epitope was replaced by a previously described one from the 3A protein of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). Animals were inoculated twice with a 21-day interval and challenged 15 days after the second immunization. Clinical signs were recorded daily and ELISA tests were performed to detect antibodies against specific peptide and E2. The neutralising antibody response was assessed 13 days after challenge. Despite the change to maleimide connectivity, only partial protection against CSFV was again observed. The best clinical protection was observed in group 3. Animals inoculated with constructs 2 and 3 showed higher anti-peptide humoral response, suggesting that two copies of the B-cell epitope are sufficient or even better than four copies for swine immune recognition. In addition, for construct 3 higher neutralizing antibody titres against CSFV were detected. Our results support the immunogenicity of the CSFV B-cell epitope and the cooperative role of the FMDV 3A T-cell epitope in inducing a neutralising response against CSFV in domestic pigs. This is also the first time that the FMDV T-cell epitope shows effectivity in improving swine immune response against a different virus.

Current eradication measures rely on the rapid clinical detection and removal of infected herds. Here, we evaluated the potential for preclinical diagnosis during reactive surveillance to reduce the risk of between-farm transmission. We used data from transmission experiments in cattle where both samples from individual animals, such as blood, probang samples, and saliva and nasal swabs, and herd-level samples, such as air samples, were taken daily during the course of infection. The sensitivity of each of these sample types for the detection of infected cattle during different phases of the early infection period was quantified. The results were incorporated into a mathematical model for FMD, in a cattle herd, to evaluate the impact of the early detection and culling of an infected herd on the infectious output. The latter was expressed as the between-herd reproduction ratio, Rh, where an effective surveillance approach would lead to a reduction in the Rh value to &lt;1. Applying weekly surveillance, clinical inspection alone was found to be ineffective at blocking transmission. This was in contrast to the impact of weekly random sampling (i.e., using saliva swabs) of at least 10 animals per farm or daily air sampling (housed cattle), both of which were shown to reduce the Rh to &lt;1. In conclusion, preclinical detection during outbreaks has the potential to allow earlier culling of infected herds and thereby reduce transmission and aid the control of epidemics. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

Functional genomics analyses of FMDV have identified few virulence factors of which the leader proteinase (Lpro) is the most thoroughly investigated. Previous work from our laboratory has characterized host factors in cattle inoculated with virulent FMDV and attenuated mutant strains with transposon insertions within Lpro. Methods: In the current study, the characteristics defining virulence of FMDV in cattle were further investigated by comparing the pathogenesis of a mutant, attenuated strain (FMDV-Mut) to the parental, virulent virus from which the mutant was derived (FMDV-WT). The only difference between the two viruses was an insertion mutation in the inter-AUG region of the leader proteinase of FMDV-Mut. All cattle were infected by simulated-natural, aerosol inoculation. Results: Both viruses were demonstrated to establish primary infection in the nasopharyngeal mucosa with subsequent dissemination to the lungs. Immunomicroscopic localization of FMDV antigens indicated that both viruses infected superficial epithelial cells of the nasopharynx and lungs. The critical differences between the two viruses were a more rapid establishment of infection by FMDV-WT and quantitatively greater virus loads in secretions and infected tissues compared to FMDV-Mut. The slower replicating FMDV-Mut established a subclinical infection that was limited to respiratory epithelial sites, whereas the faster replication of FMDV-WT facilitated establishment of viremia, systemic dissemination of infection, and clinical disease. Conclusion: The mutant FMDV was capable of achieving all the same early pathogenesis landmarks as FMDV-WT, but was unable to establish systemic infection. The precise mechanism of attenuation remains undetermined; but current data suggests that the impaired replication of the mutant is more responsible for attenuation than differences in host immunological factors. These results complement previous studies by providing data of high-granularity describing tissue-specific tropism of FMDV and by demonstrating microscopic localization of virulent and attenuated clones of the same field-strain FMDV. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017

Ribonucleic acid (RNA) from FMDV was detected in OFs from experimentally infected pigs by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) from 1 day post-infection (dpi) to 21 dpi. Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was isolated from OFs at 1 to 5 dpi. Additionally, FMDV antigens were detected in OFs from 1 to 6 dpi using a lateral flow immunochromatographic strip test (LFIST), which is a rapid pen-side test, and from 2 to 3 dpi using a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS ELISA). Furthermore, FMDV-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) was detected in OFs using an isotype-specific indirect ELISA starting at dpi 14.

None of these animals became rRT-PCR or NSP-ELISA positive, but all six animals became positive in the VNT, the in-house SPO-ELISA-IH and the commercial SPO-ELISA-PR. Two other commercial SPO-ELISAs were less sensitive or failed to detect animals as positive. The rRT-PCRs and the four most sensitive commercial ELISAs that had been used for the experimentally inoculated deer were further evaluated for diagnostic specificity (DSP) using 950 serum samples and 200 nasal swabs from non-infected animals. DSPs were 100% for the rRT-PCRs and between 99.8 and 100% for the ELISAs. © 2015 The Authors. Transboundary and Emerging Diseases Published by Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2017

Although commercially available inactivated or adenovirus-vectored-vaccines (Ad5-FMD) are effective, they require 5–7 days to induce protection. Therefore, new control strategies that stimulate rapid immune responses are needed. Expression of bovine interferon λ3 using the Ad5-vector platform (Ad5-boIFNλ3) is able to delay disease in cattle, but clinical signs appear at 9 days after challenge. We hypothesized that combination of Ad5-boIFNλ3 and Ad5-FMD could induce immediate and lasting protection against FMD. Cattle were vaccinated with an Ad5-FMD, Ad5-boIFNλ3, or the combination of both, followed by challenge at three days post-immunization. All animals treated with Ad5-FMD combined with Ad5-boIFNλ3 were fully protected against FMD, despite the absence of systemic neutralizing antibodies or antiviral activity at the time of challenge. Induction of a strong cell-mediated immune response suggested that Ad5-boIFNλ3 is able to act as an adjuvant of Ad5-FMD vaccine in cattle. © 2016",2016

In the current investigation, the potential for transmission of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) during the incubation (preclinical) period of infection was investigated in seven groups of pigs that were sequentially exposed to a group of donor pigs that were infected by simulated-natural inoculation. Contact-exposed pigs were comingled with infected donors through successive 8-h time slots spanning from 8 to 64 h post-inoculation (hpi) of the donor pigs. The transition from latent to infectious periods in the donor pigs was clearly defined by successful transmission of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) to all contact pigs that were exposed to the donors from 24 hpi and later. This onset of infectiousness occurred concurrent with detection of viremia, but approximately 24 h prior to the first appearance of clinical signs of FMD in the donors. Thus, the latent period of infection ended approximately 24 h before the end of the incubation period. There were significant differences between contact-exposed groups in the time elapsed from virus exposure to the first detection of FMDV shedding, viremia, and clinical lesions. Specifically, the onset and progression of clinical FMD were more rapid in pigs that had been exposed to the donor pigs during more advanced phases of disease, suggesting that these animals had received a higher effective challenge dose. These results demonstrate transmission and dissemination of FMD within groups of pigs during the incubation period of infection. Furthermore, these findings suggest that under current conditions, shedding of FMDV in oropharyngeal fluids is a more precise proxy for FMDV infectiousness than clinical signs of infection. These findings may impact modeling of the propagation of FMD outbreaks that initiate in pig holdings and should be considered when designing FMD control strategies. © 2016 Stenfeldt, Pacheco, Brito, Moreno-Torres, Branan, Delgado, Rodriguez and Arzt.",2016

Eighteen cattle (8 vaccinated with a recombinantFMDV A vaccine, 10 non-vaccinated) were challenged with FMDV A24 Cruzeiro, and the gene expression profiles of nasopharyngeal tissues collected between 21 and 35 days after challenge were compared between 11 persistently infected carriers and 7 non-carriers. Carriers and non-carrierswere furthercompared to 2 naïve animals that had been neither vaccinated nor challenged. At a controlled false-discovery rate of 10% and a minimum difference in expression of 50%, 648 genes were differentially expressed between FMDV carriers and non-carriers, and most (467) had higher expression in carriers.Among these, genes associated with cellular proliferation and the immune response-such as chemokines, cytokines and genes regulating T and B cells-were significantly overrepresented. Differential gene expression was significantly correlated between non-vaccinated and vaccinated animals (biological correlation +0.97), indicating a similar transcriptome profile across these groups. Genes related to prostaglandinE2 production and the induction of regulatoryT cells were overexpressed in carriers. In contrast, tissues from non-carrier animals expressed higher levels of complement regulators and pro-Apoptotic genes that could promote virus clearance. Based on these findings, we propose a working hypothesis for FMDV persistence in nasopharyngeal tissues of cattle, in which the virus may be maintained by an impairmentof apoptosis and the local suppression of cell-mediated antiviral immunity by inducible regulatoryT cells. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) proteins constitute a family of viral restriction factors that can inhibit the replication of several types of viruses. Our previous study showed that overexpression of swine IFITM3 (sIFITM3) impeded replication of the FMD virus (FMDV) in BHK-21 cells and mice. In this study, sIFITM3-transgenic (TG) pigs were produced by handmade cloning. Results showed that sIFITM3 was highly overexpressed in many organs of sIFITM3-TG pigs compared to wild-type pigs. After a virulent FMDV strain (O/ES/2001) was intramuscularly inoculated, the sIFITM3-TG pigs showed slightly higher susceptibility to FMDV infection than wild-type pigs. Both groups displayed comparable degrees of clinical symptoms throughout the 14-day observation period. Therefore, the induction of systemic sIFITM3 expression does not protect pigs against FMDV infection. Based on these observations, we propose that a combination of interferons and vaccines be used to control FMDV infections and subsequent FMD outbreaks. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.",2016

AdtA24 non-adjuvanted vaccine was administered intramuscularly to a total of 150 steers in doses ranging from approximately 1.0 × 108 to 2.1 × 1011 particle units per animal. No detectable local or systemic reactions were observed after vaccination. At 7 days post-vaccination (dpv), vaccinated and control animals were challenged with FMDV serotype A24 Cruzeiro via the intradermal lingual route. Vaccine efficacy was measured by FMDV A24 serum neutralizing titers and by protection from clinical disease and viremia after challenge. The results of eight studies demonstrated a strong correlation between AdtA24 vaccine dose and protection from clinical disease (R2 = 0.97) and viremia (R2 = 0.98). There was also a strong correlation between FMDV A24 neutralization titers on day of challenge and protection from clinical disease (R2 = 0.99). Vaccination with AdtA24 enabled differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) as demonstrated by the absence of antibodies to the FMDV nonstructural proteins in vaccinates prior to challenge. Lack of AdtA24 vaccine shedding after vaccination was indicated by the absence of neutralizing antibody titers to both the adenovector and FMDV A24 Cruzeiro in control animals after co-mingling with vaccinated cattle for three to four weeks. In summary, a non-adjuvanted AdtA24 experimental vaccine was shown to be safe, immunogenic, consistently protected cattle at 7 dpv against direct, homologous FMDV challenge, and enabled differentiation of infected from vaccinated cattle prior to challenge. © 2016.",2016

Here, we have expressed the FMDV capsid protein precursor (P1-2A) of strain O1 Manisa alone or with the FMDV 3C protease (3Cpro ) using a ""single cycle"" packaged alphavirus self-replicating RNA based on Semliki Forest virus (SFV). When the FMDV P1-2A was expressed with 3Cpro then processing of the FMDV capsid precursor protein is observed within cells and the proteins assemble into empty capsid particles. The products interact with anti-FMDV antibodies in an ELISA and bind to the integrin αv β6 (a cellular receptor for FMDV). In cattle vaccinated with these rSFV-FMDV vectors alone, anti-FMDV antibodies were elicited but the immune response was insufficient to give protection against FMDV challenge. However, the prior vaccination with these vectors resulted in a much stronger immune response against FMDV post-challenge and the viremia observed was decreased in level and duration. In subsequent experiments, cattle were sequentially vaccinated with a rSFV-FMDV followed by recombinant FMDV empty capsid particles, or vice versa, prior to challenge. Animals given a primary vaccination with the rSFV-FMDV vector and then boosted with FMDV empty capsids showed a strong anti-FMDV antibody response prior to challenge, they were protected against disease and no FMDV RNA was detected in their sera post-challenge. Initial inoculation with empty capsids followed by the rSFV-FMDV was much less effective at combating the FMDV challenge and a large postchallenge boost to the level of anti-FMDV antibodies was observed. This prime-boost system, using reagents that can be generated outside of high-containment facilities, offers significant advantages to achieve control of FMD by vaccination. © 2016 Gullberg et al.

The recovered virus had the same in vitro characterization as the parental virus with regard to antigenicity in neutralization and indirect immunofluorescence tests, plaque size and one-step growth. Pigs were experimentally infected with the parental virus or the recombinant virus recovered from pSVL-f02 transfected cells. There were no significant differences in clinical signs or antibody responses between the two groups, and virus isolation and viral RNA detection from clinical samples were similar.

We have hypothesized here the effective insertion of the VP1 epitopes (three amino acid residues 21-40, 141-160 and 200-213 in VP1, designated VPe) of foot-and-mouth disease (FMDV) within the external loops of PPV VP2 could be carried out without altering assembly based on structural and antigenic data. To investigate the possibility, development of two recombinant adenovirus rAd-PPV:VP2-FMDV:VPe a or rAd-PPV:VP2-FMDV:VPe b were expressed in HEK-293 cells. Out of the two insertion strategies tested, one of them tolerated an insert of 57 amino acids in one of the four external loops without disrupting the VLPs assembly. Mice were inoculated with the two recombinant adenoviruses, and an immunogenicity study showed that the highest levels of FMDV-specific humoral responses and T cell proliferation could be induced by rAd-PPV:VP2-FMDV:VPe b expressing hybrid PPV:VLPs (FMDV) in the absence of an adjuvant. Then, the protective efficacy of inoculating swine with rAd-PPV:VP2-FMDV:VPe b was tested. All pigs inoculated with rAd-PPV:VP2-FMDV:VPe b were protected from viral challenge, meanwhile the neutralizing antibody titers were significantly higher than those in the group inoculated with swine FMD type O synthetic peptide vaccine.

The prevalence of FMDVpersistence was similar in both groups (62% in vaccinated cattle, 67% in nonvaccinated cattle), despite vaccinated cattle havingbeen protected from clinical disease. Analysis of antemortem infection dynamics demonstrated that the subclinical divergencebetween FMDV carriers and animals that cleared the infection had occurred by 10 days postinfection (dpi) in vaccinated cattleand by 21 dpi in nonvaccinated animals. The anatomic distribution of virus in subclinically infected, vaccinated cattle was restrictedto the pharynx throughout both the early and the persistent phases of infection. In nonvaccinated cattle, systemicallydisseminated virus was cleared from peripheral sites by 10 dpi, while virus selectively persisted within the nasopharynx of a subsetof animals. The quantities of viral RNA shed in oropharyngeal fluid during FMDV persistence were similar in vaccinated andnonvaccinated cattle. FMDV structural and nonstructural proteins were localized to follicle-associated epithelium of the dorsalsoft palate and dorsal nasopharynx in persistently infected cattle. Host transcriptome analysis of tissue samples processed bylaser capture microdissection indicated suppression of antiviral host factors (interferon regulatory factor 7, CXCL10 [gammainterferon-inducible protein 10], gamma interferon, and lambda interferon) in association with persistent FMDV. In contrast,during the transitional phase of infection, the level of expression of IFN-mRNA was higher in follicle-associated epithelium ofanimals that had cleared the infection.

Several serotype-specific vaccine formulations exist, but they require about 5 to 7 days to induce protective immunity. Our previous studies have shown that a constitutively active fusion protein of porcine interferon (IFN) regulatory factors (IRF) 7 and 3 [IRF7/3(5D)] strongly induced type I IFN and antiviral genes in vitro and prevented mortality in an FMD mouse model when delivered with a replication-defective adenoviral vector [Ad5-poIRF7/3(5D)]. Here, we demonstrate that pigs treated with 108, 109, or 1010 PFU of Ad5-poIRF7/3(5D) 24 h before FMDV challenge were fully protected from FMD clinical signs and did not develop viremia, virus shedding or antibodies against FMDV nonstructural proteins. Pigs treated with Ad5-poIRF7/3(5D) had higher levels of IFN and antiviral activity in serum, and upregulated expression of several IFN-stimulated genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, compared to pigs treated with Ad5-Blue vector control. Importantly, treatment of porcine cultured cells with Ad5-poIRF7/3(5D) inhibited the replication of all 7 FMDV serotypes. In vitro experiments using cultured embryonic fibroblasts derived from IFN receptor knockout mice suggested that the antiviral response induced by Ad5-poIRF7/3(5D) was dependent on type I and III IFN pathways; however, experiments with mice demonstrated that a functional type I IFN pathway mediates Ad5-poIRF7/3(5D) protection conferred in vivo. Our studies demonstrate that inoculation with Ad5-poIRF7/3(5D) completely protects swine against FMD by inducing a strong type I IFN response and highlights its potential application to rapidly and effectively prevent FMDV replication and dissemination. © 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

In order to develop safer vaccines effective against all three diseases, a pathogenic strain of LSDV (Warmbaths [WB], South Africa) was attenuated by removing a putative virulence factor gene (IL-10-like) using gene knockout (KO) technology. This construct (LSDV WB005KO) was then evaluated as a vaccine for sheep and goats against virulent capripoxvirus challenge. Sheep and goats were vaccinated with the construct and the animals were observed for 21 days. The vaccine appeared to be safe, and did not cause disease, although it induced minor inflammation at the injection site similar to that caused by other attenuated sheep and goat pox vaccines. In addition, no virus replication was detected in blood, oral or nasal swabs using real-time PCR following vaccination and low levels of neutralising antibodies were detected in both sheep and goats. Leukocytes isolated from vaccinated animals following vaccination elicited capripoxvirus-specific IFN-γ secretion, suggesting that immunity was also T-cell mediated. Following challenge with virulent capripoxvirus, vaccinated sheep and goats were found to be completely protected and exhibited no clinical disease. Furthermore, real-time PCR of blood samples at various time points suggested that viremia was absent in both groups of vaccinated animals, as opposed to capripoxvirus-related clinical disease and viremia observed in the unvaccinated animals. These findings suggest that this novel knockout strain of LSDV has potential as a vaccine to protect livestock against sheep pox and goat pox. Crown Copyright © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2015

The vaccine appeared to be safe, and did not cause disease, although it induced minor inflammation at the injection site similar to that caused by other attenuated sheep and goat pox vaccines. In addition, no virus replication was detected in blood, oral or nasal swabs using real-time PCR following vaccination and low levels of neutralising antibodies were detected in both sheep and goats. Leukocytes isolated from vaccinated animals following vaccination elicited capripoxvirus-specific IFN-γ secretion, suggesting that immunity was also T-cell mediated. Following challenge with virulent capripoxvirus, vaccinated sheep and goats were found to be completely protected and exhibited no clinical disease. Furthermore, real-time PCR of blood samples at various time points suggested that viremia was absent in both groups of vaccinated animals, as opposed to capripoxvirus-related clinical disease and viremia observed in the unvaccinated animals. These findings suggest that this novel knockout strain of LSDV has potential as a vaccine to protect livestock against sheep pox and goat pox. Crown Copyright © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2015

It is therefore essential to determine what role vaccination could play to prevent clinical disease and lower virus excretion into the environment. In this study we investigated the efficacy of the double oil emulsion A Malaysia 97 vaccine (&gt;6PD50/dose) against heterologous challenge with an isolate belonging to the A SEA-97 lineage at 4 and 7 days post vaccination (dpv). In addition, we determined whether physical separation of pigs in the same room could prevent virus transmission. Statistically there was no difference in the level of protection offered by 4 and 7 dpv. However, no clinical disease or viral RNA was detected in the blood of pigs challenged 4 dpv, although three of the pigs had antibodies to the non-structural proteins (NSPs), indicating viral replication. Viral RNA was also detected in nasal and saliva swabs, but on very few occasions. Two of the pigs vaccinated seven days prior to challenge had vesicles distal from the injection site, but on the inoculated foot, and two pigs had viral RNA detected in the blood. One pig sero-converted to the NSPs. In contrast, all unvaccinated and inoculated pigs had evidence of infection. No infection occurred in any of the susceptible pigs in the same room, but separated from the infected pigs, indicating that strict biosecurity measures were sufficient under these experimental conditions to prevent virus transmission. However, viral RNA was detected in the nasal swabs of one group of pigs, but apparently not at sufficient levels to cause clinical disease. Vaccination led to a significant decrease in viral RNA in vaccinated pigs compared to unvaccinated and infected pigs, even with this heterologous challenge, and could therefore be considered as a control option during outbreaks. © 2015 The Authors.",2015

A novel alternative strategy is to develop pigs that are genetically resistant to infection.

In vitro challenge of TG fibroblasts showed the shRNA suppressed viral growth. TG and non-TG pigs were challenged by intramuscular injection with 100 LD50 of FMDV. High fever, severe clinical signs of foot-and-mouth disease and typical histopathological changes were observed in all of the non-TG pigs but in none of the high-siRNA pigs.

This has serious implications for control of FMD using vaccines as well as the choice of strains to include in regional antigen banks. Here, we investigated an intra-serotype chimeric virus, vSAT2ZIM14-SAT2, which was engineered by replacing the surface-exposed capsid-coding region (1B-1D/2A) of a SAT2 genome-length clone, pSAT2, with that of the field isolate, SAT2/ZIM/14/90. The chimeric FMDV produced by this technique was viable, grew to high titres and stably maintained the 1B-1D/2A sequence upon passage. Chemically inactivated, oil adjuvanted vaccines of both the chimeric and parental immunogens were used to vaccinate cattle. The serological response to vaccination showed the production of strong neutralizing antibody titres that correlated with protection against homologous FMDV challenge. We also predicted a good likelihood that cattle vaccinated with an intra-serotype chimeric vaccine would be protected against challenge with viruses that caused recent outbreaks in southern Africa. These results provide support that chimeric vaccines containing the external capsid of field isolates induce protective immune responses in FMD host species similar to the parental vaccine. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",2015

However, 80% and 60% of pigs that were vaccinated seven and four days prior to coronary band challenge were protected. Vaccination significantly reduced the amount of virus excreted in nasal swabs, saliva and faeces compared to unvaccinated and infected controls. Virus and viral RNA could be detected in some pigs until termination of the experiment 14 days after challenge. Antibodies to the non-structural proteins (NSP) were detected in only one pig that was challenged four days post vaccination (dpv) and transiently in two pigs that were challenged sevendpv at only one time point. For each vaccine and control group, a group of unvaccinated pigs were kept in the same room but with no direct contact with the infected pigs to determine whether vaccination prevented transmission. Despite the presence of live virus and viral RNA in these indirect contact pigs, the groups in contact with the vaccinated and infected pigs did not develop clinical signs nor did they sero-convert. Contact pigs in the same room as unvaccinated challenged controls did show signs of disease and virus infection that resulted in sero-conversion to the NSP.

In each group 2 sheep were inoculated and contact exposed to 2 pen-mates. Viral excretion was detected for a long period (&gt;21 days post-inoculation, dpi). Transmission of FMDV occurred in the non-vaccinated groups (R0=1.14) but only in the first week after infection, when virus shedding was highest. In the vaccinated groups no transmission occurred (Rv&lt;1, p=0.013). The viral excretion of the vaccinated sheep and the viral load in their pens was significantly lower than that of the non-vaccinated sheep.FMDV could be detected in plasma samples from 12 of 17 infected non-vaccinated sheep, for an average of 2.1 days, but in none of the 10 infected vaccinated sheep. In contrast, FMDV could readily be isolated from mouth swab samples from both non-vaccinated and vaccinated infected sheep starting at 1-3. dpi and in 16 of 27 infected sheep up till 21. dpi. Serologically, after 3-4 weeks, all but one of the infected sheep were detected using the NS-ELISA. We conclude that vaccination of a sheep population would likely stop an epidemic of FMDV and that the use of mouth swab samples would be a good alternative (instead of using vesicular lesions or blood samples) to detect an FMD infection in a sheep population both early and prolonged after infection. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",2015

To quantify the contribution of a contaminated environment to the transmission of FMDV, this study used calves that were not vaccinated and calves that were vaccinated 1 week prior to inoculation with the virus in direct and indirect contact experiments. In direct contact experiments, contact calves were exposed to inoculated calves in the same room. In indirect contact experiments, contact calves were housed in rooms that previously had held inoculated calves for three days (either from 0 to 3 or from 3 to 6 days post inoculation). Secretions and excretions from all calves were tested for the presence of FMDV by virus isolation; the results were used to quantify FMDV transmission. This was done using a generalized linear model based on a 2 route (2R, i.e. direct contact and environment) SIR model that included information on FMDV survival in the environment. The study shows that roughly 44% of transmission occurs via the environment, as indicated by the reproduction ratio R ^ 0 2 R environment $$ {{\widehat{R}}-0}^{2R} environment $$ that equalled 2.0, whereas the sum of R ^ 0 2 R contact $$ {{\widehat{R}}-0}^{2R} contact $$ and R ^ 0 2 R environment $$ {{\widehat{R}}-0}^{2R} environment $$ equalled 4.6. Because vaccination 1 week prior to inoculation of the calves conferred protective immunity against FMDV infection, no transmission rate parameters could be estimated from the experiments with vaccinated calves. We conclude that a contaminated environment contributes considerably to the transmission of FMDV therefore that hygiene measures can play a crucial role in FMD control. © 2015 Bravo de Rueda et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",2015

All four exposure systems were efficient in generating consistently severe, generalized FMD with synchronous clinical characteristics within exposure groups, indicating that this Myanmar98 strain is highly virulent in sheep. Clinical and virological dynamics were similarly rapid following INP- and coronary band inoculation, with both systems leading to significantly earlier detection of virus shedding when compared to aerosol inoculation and contact exposure. The data presented herein support application of the two optimized simulated natural inoculation systems as valid alternatives to conventionally used exposure systems for studies of FMDV pathogenesis and vaccinology in sheep.

Despite the high efficacy of the trivalent vaccine, low antibody formation was reported in the pig industry and there is considerable concern about the ability of the vaccine to protect against the Andong strain responsible for recent outbreaks in South Korea. To overcome these problems, immunostimulators have been widely used to improve vaccine efficacy in South Korea, although without any scientific evidence. Based on the current situation, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of germanium biotite, a feed supplement used to enhance the immune system, on the immune responses to FMD vaccination through the Andong strain challenge experiment in trivalent vaccinated pigs. Following the challenge, the germanium biotite-fed pigs showed high levels of IL-8 in serum, and increased cellular immune responses to stimulation with the Andong strain antigen compared to nonsupplemented pigs. In addition, higher FMD virus (FMDV) neutralizing antibody titers were detected in the germanium biotite-fed group than in the nonsupplemented group before the challenge.

Ropes were used to collect oral fluid samples from pigs, and each sample was compared to saliva samples collected from individual animals by detecting FMD virus RNA using real-time PCR. Two different experiments are described where groups of pigs were infected with different serotypes of FMD virus, either with or without vaccination, and unvaccinated pigs were kept in aerosol contact. The sensitivity of the rope sampling varied between 0.67 and 0.92, and the statistical agreement between this method and individual sampling ranged from substantial to moderate for the two different serotypes. The ease of collecting oral fluids using ropes together with the high sensitivity of subsequent FMD detection through PCR indicates that this could be a useful method to monitor pig populations for FMD virus infection.

Combination treatment strategies have been used to enhance the efficacy of antiviral agents, and such strategies may be advantageous in overcoming viral mechanisms of resistance to antiviral treatments. We have developed recombinant adenoviruses (Ads) for the simultaneous expression of porcine alpha and gamma interferons (Ad-porcine IFN-αβ) as well as 3 small interfering RNAs (Ad-3siRNA) targeting FMDV mRNAs encoding nonstructural proteins. The antiviral effects of Ad-porcine IFN-αβ and Ad-3siRNA expression were tested in combination in porcine cells, suckling mice, and swine. We observed enhanced antiviral effects in porcine cells and mice as well as robust protection against the highly pathogenic strain O/Andong/ SKR/2010 and increased expression of cytokines in swine following combination treatment. In addition, we showed that combination treatment was effective against all serotypes of FMDV. Therefore, we suggest that the combined treatment with Adporcine IFN-αβ and Ad-3siRNA may offer fast-acting antiviral protection and be used with a vaccine during the period that the vaccine does not provide protection against FMD. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.",2015

Indian FMD control program recommends twice a year vaccination. Development of high potency vaccines that provide better immune response can singificantly contribute to control programme by reducing the frequency of vaccination. The present study explores new adjuvants to enhance the protective efficacy of inactivated trivalent FMD vaccines. Methodology and principal findingsVacciMax® is a novel adjuvant which uses a liposome-based oil emulsion platform. Cattle were immunized using VacciMax-A and VacciMax-B FMD vaccines and evaluated for protective efficacy. Similar groups of animals were also boosted after 6 months to study the effect of booster immunisation on protection against homologous challenge. Serum samples from immunized animals were tested by virus neutralization test (VNT) and liquid phase blocking ELISA (LPBE). After challenge, animals were screened for virus load by real-time PCR and reactivity in non-structural protein (3ABC) antibody detection ELISA to corroborate the protection data. A single dose of VacciMax-A formulation elicited higher percentage protection (63%) in VacciMax-A compared to 25% in VacciMax-B upon challenge at one-year post-vaccination. Upon boosting at 6 months also, VacciMax-A group showed higher levels of protection (100%) compared to VacciMax-B (86%), even though both the groups elicited comparable VNT titre (p=0.4964). The results also demonstrated that intramuscular route was preferrable over subcutaneous route of administration. ConclusionThe study demonstrates that immunization with VacciMax-A-IM adjuvanted FMD vaccine with high antigen payload under boosting regimen could effectively be used as potent vaccine to maintain herd immunity. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2015

However, since relatively large amounts of Ad5-CI-A24-2B are required to induce protection this strategy could be costly for livestock production. Poly ICLC is a synthetic double stranded RNA that activates multiple innate and adaptive immune pathways. In this study, we have tested for the first time, the adjuvant effect of poly ICLC in combination with Ad5-CI-A24-2B in swine. We found that the combination resulted in a reduction of the vaccine protective dose by 80-fold. Interestingly, the lowest dose of Ad5-CI-A24-2B plus 1. mg of poly ICLC protected animals against challenge even in the absence of detectable FMDV-specific neutralizing antibodies at the time of challenge. © 2014.",2014

However, it is not known whether the use of LSDV infected semen in AI poses a biosecurity risk. The aim of this study was to investigate whether LSDV, transmitted through semen, can infect cows and their embryos. Two controlled trials were performed simultaneously. Eleven young beef heifers, naïve to LSDV, were synchronized using an OvSynch protocol and inseminated on Day 0 with fresh semen spiked with a field strain of LSDV on day 0. Six of the heifers were superovulated on Day 1 using pregnant mare serum gonadotropin, and embryos were flushed from these heifers on Day 6. Blood and serum samples were collected from Day 4 until Day 27 to determine the presence of LSDV by PCR and virus isolation, and the presence of antibodies against LSDV by SNT. The first clinical signs of LSD were noticed on Day 10, followed by severe generalized LSD in three heifers and mild LSD in two more heifers. Two heifers were humanely euthanized due to severe unresponsive stranguria. LSDV was detected by PCR, virus isolation or electron microscopy in blood, embryos and organs of experimentally infected animals; and eight heifers had seroconverted by Day 27. Two control animals were not affected. This is the first report of experimental seminal transmission of LSDV in cattle. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",2014

Swine can be sterilely protected after vaccination with an Ad5 that encodes porcine type I IFN (poIFN-α), and cattle can be similarly protected or develop significantly reduced disease when treated with an Ad5 delivering bovine type III IFN (boIFN-λ3). Here, we have evaluated the efficacy of porcine IFN-λ3 (poIFN-λ3) against FMD virus in vivo. Swine inoculated with different doses of Ad5-poIFN-λ3 were protected against disease in a dose-dependent manner. Despite the absence of systemic antiviral activity, 7 out of 10 Ad5-poIFN-λ3 inoculated animals did not develop disease or viremia, and the other 3 inoculated animals displayed delayed and milder disease by 7 days postchallenge as compared with control animals inoculated with an Ad5 control vector. While analysis of gene expression showed significant induction of IFN and IFN-stimulated genes in Ad5-poIFN-λ3-treated cultured porcine epithelial kidney cells, there was limited gene induction in peripheral blood monocytes isolated from treated swine. These results suggest that treatment with Ad5-poIFN-λ3 is an effective biotherapeutic strategy against FMD in swine. © Copyright 2014, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2014.",2014

Intra-oropharyngeal (IOP) and intra-nasopharyngeal (INP) inoculation both enabled precise control of dose and timing of inoculation while simulating field exposure conditions.There were substantial differences between outcomes of infections by the two routes. IOP inoculation resulted in consistent and synchronous infection, whereas INP inoculation at similar doses resulted in delayed, or completely absent infection. All pigs that developed clinical infection had detectable levels of FMDV RNA in their oropharynx directly following inoculation. Furthermore, FMDV antigens were localized to the oropharyngeal tonsils suggesting a role in early infection.The utility of IOP inoculation was further demonstrated in a vaccine-challenge experiment. Thus, the novel system of IOP inoculation described herein, offers a valid alternative to traditionally used systems for FMDV inoculation of pigs, applicable for experimental studies of FMDV pathogenesis and vaccinology. © 2014.",2014

The earliest detectable event was primary infection in the lingual and paraepiglottic tonsils at 6 hours post inoculation (hpi) characterized by regional localization of viral RNA, viral antigen, and infectious virus. At this time FMDV antigen was localized in cytokeratin-positive epithelial cells and CD172a-expressing leukocytes of the crypt epithelium of the paraepiglottic tonsils. De novo replication of FMDV was first detected in oropharyngeal swab samples at 12 hpi and viremia occurred at 18-24 hpi, approximately 24 hours prior to the appearance of vesicular lesions. From 12 through 78 hpi, microscopic detection of FMDV was consistently localized to cytokeratin-positive cells within morphologically characteristic segments of oropharyngeal tonsil crypt epithelium. During this period, leukocyte populations expressing CD172a, SLA-DQ class II and/or CD8 were found in close proximity to infected epithelial cells, but with little or no co-localization with viral proteins. Similarly, M-cells expressing cytokeratin-18 did not colocalize with FMDV proteins. Intra-epithelial micro-vesicles composed of acantholytic epithelial cells expressing large amounts of structural and non-structural FMDV proteins were present within crypts of the tonsil of the soft palate during peak clinical infection. These findings inculpate the paraepiglottic tonsils as the primary site of FMDV infection in pigs exposed via the gastrointestinal tract. Furthermore, the continuing replication of FMDV in the oropharyngeal tonsils during viremia and peak clinical infection with no concurrent amplification of virus occurring in the lower respiratory tract indicates that these sites are the major source of shedding of FMDV from pigs.",2014

Many efforts are currently devoted to improve the immune responses and protective efficacy of these vaccines. Adjuvants, which are often used to potentiate immune responses, provide an excellent mean to improve the efficacy of FMD vaccines. This study aimed to evaluate three oil adjuvants namely: Montanide ISA-201, ISA-206 (SEPPIC, France) and GAHOL (an in-house developed oil-adjuvant) for adjuvant potential in inactivated FMD vaccine. Groups of cattle (n=6) were immunized once intramuscularly with monovalent FMDV 'O' vaccine formulated in these adjuvants, and humoral (serum neutralizing antibody, IgG1 and IgG2) and cellular (lymphoproliferation) responses were measured. Montanide ISA-201 adjuvanted vaccine induced earlier and higher neutralizing antibody responses as compared to the two other adjuvants. All the adjuvants induced mainly serum IgG1 isotype antibody responses against FMDV. However, Montanide ISA-201 induced relatively higher IgG2 responses than the other two adjuvants. Lymphoproliferative responses to recall FMDV antigen were relatively higher with Montanide ISA-201, although not always statistically significant. On homologous FMDV challenge at 30 days post-vaccination, 100% (6/6) of the cattle immunized with Montanide-201 adjuvanted vaccine were protected, which was superior to those immunized with ISA-206 (66.6%, 4/6) or GAHOL adjuvanted vaccine (50%, 3/6). Virus replication following challenge infection, as determined by presence of the viral genome in oropharynx and non-structural protein serology, was lowest with Montanide ISA-201 adjuvant. Collectively, these results indicate that the Montanide ISA-201 adjuvanted FMD vaccine induces enhanced immune responses and protective efficacy in cattle. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2013

The format of FMD virus-like particles (VLP) as a non-replicating particulate vaccine candidate is a promising alternative to conventional inactivated FMDV vaccines. In this study, we explored a prokaryotic system to express and assemble the FMD VLP and validated the potential of VLP as an FMDV vaccine candidate. VLP composed entirely of FMDV (Asia1/Jiangsu/ China/2005) capsid proteins (VP0, VP1 and VP3) were simultaneously produced as SUMO fusion proteins by an improved SUMO fusion protein system in E. coli. Proteolytic removal of the SUMO moiety from the fusion proteins resulted in the assembly of VLP with size and shape resembling the authentic FMDV. Immunization of guinea pigs, swine and cattle with FMD VLP by intramuscular inoculation stimulated the FMDV-specific antibody response, neutralizing antibody response, T-cell proliferation response and secretion of cytokine IFN-γ. In addition, immunization with one dose of the VLP resulted in complete protection of these animals from homologous FMDV challenge. The 50% protection dose (PD§ssub§50§esub§) of FMD VLP in cattle is up to 6.34. These results suggest that FMD VLP expressed in E. coli are an effective vaccine in guinea pigs, swine and cattle and support further development of these VLP as a vaccine candidate for protection against FMDV. © 2013 Guo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2013

Current inactivated virus vaccines require expensive high containment facilities for their production and maintenance of a cold-chain for their activity. We have addressed both of these major drawbacks. Firstly we have developed methods to efficiently express recombinant empty capsids. Expression constructs aimed at lowering the levels and activity of the viral protease required for the cleavage of the capsid protein precursor were used; this enabled the synthesis of empty A-serotype capsids in eukaryotic cells at levels potentially attractive to industry using both vaccinia virus and baculovirus driven expression. Secondly we have enhanced capsid stability by incorporating a rationally designed mutation, and shown by X-ray crystallography that stabilised and wild-type empty capsids have essentially the same structure as intact virus. Cattle vaccinated with recombinant capsids showed sustained virus neutralisation titres and protection from challenge 34 weeks after immunization. This approach to vaccine antigen production has several potential advantages over current technologies by reducing production costs, eliminating the risk of infectivity and enhancing the temperature stability of the product. Similar strategies that will optimize host cell viability during expression of a foreign toxic gene and/or improve capsid stability could allow the production of safe vaccines for other pathogenic picornaviruses of humans and animals. © 2013 Porta et al.",2013

This acute disease, caused by the FMD virus (FMDV), usually includes an active replication phase in the respiratory tract for up to 72 h postinfection, followed by hematogenous dissemination and vesicular lesions at oral and foot epithelia. The role of the early local adaptive immunity of the host in the outcome of the infection is not well understood. Here we report the kinetics of appearance of FMDV-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) in lymphoid organs along the respiratory tract and the spleen in cattle infected by aerosol exposure. While no responses were observed for up to 3 days postinfection (dpi), all animals developed FMDV-ASC in all the lymphoid organs studied at 4 dpi. Tracheobronchial lymph nodes were the most reactive organs at this time, and IgM was the predominant isotype, followed by IgG1. Numbers of FMDV-ASC were further augmented at 5 and 6 dpi, with an increasing prevalence in upper respiratory organs. Systemic antibody responses were slightly delayed compared with the local reaction. Also, IgM was the dominant isotype in serum at 5 dpi, coinciding with a sharp decrease of viral RNA detection in peripheral blood. These results indicate that following aerogenous administration, cattle develop a rapid and vigorous genuine local antibody response throughout the respiratory tract. Time course and isotype profiles indicate the presence of an efficient T cell-independent antibody response which drives the IgM-mediated virus clearance in cattle infected by FMDV aerosol exposure. © 2013, American Society for Microbiology.",2013

Methodology/Principal Findings: A novel plasmid-based reverse genetics system was used to construct a chimeric strain by replacing the P1 gene in the vaccine strain O/CHA/99 with that from the epidemic stain A/WH/CHA/09. The chimeric virus displayed growth kinetics similar to those of O/CHA/99 and was selected for use as a candidate vaccine strain after 12 passages in BHK cells. Cattle were vaccinated with the inactivated vaccine and humoral immune responses were induced in most of the animals on day 7. A challenge infection with A/WH/CHA/09 on day 28 indicated that the group given a 4-μg dose was fully protected and neither developed viremia nor seroconverted to a 3ABC antigen. Conclusions/Significance: Our data demonstrate that the chimeric virus not only propagates well in BHK cells and has excellent antigenic matching against serotype A FMD, but is also a potential marker vaccine to distinguish infection from vaccination.

Two mutations in 3Dpol, H27Y and N31R, as well as RQKP9-12→PVKV substitutions, in 3B2abolish reactivity with monoclonal antibodies targeting the respective sequences in 3Dpol and 3B. Infectious cDNA clones encoding the marker viruses also contain unique restriction endonuclease sites flanking the capsid-coding region that allow for easy derivation of custom designed vaccine candidates.In contrast to the parental A24WT virus, single A24LL3DYR and double A24LL3BPVKV3DYR mutant viruses were markedly attenuated upon inoculation of cattle using the natural aerosol or direct tongue inoculation. Likewise, pigs inoculated with live A24LL3DYR virus in the heel bulbs showed no clinical signs of disease, no fever, and no FMD transmission to in-contact animals. Immunization of cattle with chemically inactivated A24LL3DYR and A24LL3BPVKV3DYR vaccines provided 100% protection from challenge with parental wild-type virus. These attenuated, antigenically marked viruses provide a safe alternativeto virulent strains for FMD vaccine manufacturing. In addition, a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay targeted to the negative markers provides a suitable companion test for differentiating infected from vaccinated animals.© 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",2012

However, there are occasions when some animals with high virus neutralising (VN) antibody are not protected following challenge and some with low neutralising antibody which do not succumb to disease. The importance of cell mediated immunity in clinical protection is less clear and so we investigated the source and production of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in re-stimulated whole blood of FMDV immunized cattle and its correlation to vaccine induced protection and FMDV persistence. We were able to show a positive correlation between IFN-γ response and vaccine induced protection as well as reduction of long term persistence of FMD virus. When combining this IFN-γ response in re-stimulated blood with virus neutralizing antibody titer in serum on the day of challenge, a better correlation of vaccine-induced protection with IFN-γ and VN antibody was predicted.

Hence, modification of these structural proteins may alter the properties of the virus. In the present study we compared the pathogenicity of different FMDVs in young pigs. In total 32 pigs, 7-weeks-old, were exposed to virus, either by direct inoculation or through contact with inoculated pigs, using cell culture adapted (O1K B64), chimeric (O1K/A-TUR and O1K/O-UKG) or field strain (O-UKG/34/2001) viruses. The O1K B64 virus and the two chimeric viruses are identical to each other except for the capsid coding region. Animals exposed to O1K B64 did not exhibit signs of disease, while pigs exposed to each of the other viruses showed typical clinical signs of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). All pigs infected with the O1K/O-UKG chimera or the field strain (O-UKG/34/2001) developed fulminant disease. Furthermore, 3 of 4 in-contact pigs exposed to the O1K/O-UKG virus died in the acute phase of infection, likely from myocardial infection. However, in the group exposed to the O1K/A-TUR chimeric virus, only 1 pig showed symptoms of disease within the time frame of the experiment (10 days). All pigs that developed clinical disease showed a high level of viral RNA in serum and infected pigs that survived the acute phase of infection developed a serotype specific antibody response. It is concluded that the capsid coding sequences are determinants of FMDV pathogenicity in pigs. © 2012 Lohse et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2012

While a 4. h exposure was sufficient for strain A24 Cruzeiro (A24Cru), both O1 Manisa and Asia1 Shamir transmission required 18. h or more.

One of the most highly infectious and contagious livestock pathogens known, the disease spreads rapidly in naïve populations making it critical to have rapidly acting vaccines. Needle inoculation of killed virus vaccine is an efficient method of swiftly vaccinating large numbers of animals, either in eradication efforts or in outbreak situations in disease free countries, although, to be efficient, this requires utilizing the same needle with multiple animals. Here we present studies using a needle free system for vaccination with killed virus vaccine, FMDV strain O1 Manisa, as a rapid and consistent delivery platform. Cattle were vaccinated using a commercially available vaccine formulation at the manufacturer's recommended dose as well as four and sixteen fold less antigen load per dose. Animals were challenged intradermalingually (IDL) with live, virulent virus, homologous strain O1 Manisa, at various times following vaccination. All non-vaccinated control cattle exhibited clinical disease, including fever, viremia and lesions, specifically vesicle formation. Cattle vaccinated with the 1/16× and 1/4× doses using the needle free device were protected when challenged at both 7 and 28 days after vaccination. These data suggest that effective protection against disease can be achieved with 1/16 of the recommended vaccine dose when delivered using the needle free, intradermal delivery system, indicating the current vaccine stockpile that can be extended by many fold using this system. © 2012.",2012

Twenty-five Holstein Friesian cross-bred cattle were vaccinated twice, 21days apart, with a DNA vaccine containing the capsid coding region (P1) along with the non-structural proteins 2A, 3C and 3D (pcDNA3.1/P1-2A3C3D) of O 1 Kaufbeuren alone or coated onto PLG (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) microparticles. In some pcDNA3.1/P1-2A3C3D was also combined with an adjuvant plasmid expressing bovine granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). DNA vaccinations were administered intramuscularly with, or without, the use of electroporation and at 42days post primary vaccination cattle received a protein boost of 146S FMD virus (FMDV) antigen and non-structural protein 3D. For comparison, four cattle were vaccinated with a conventional FMD vaccine and two more included as unvaccinated controls. Apart from those immunised with PLG microparticles all cattle were challenged with 10 5 TCID 50 cattle adapted O 1 Lausanne FMDV virus at day 93 post primary vaccination. All DNA vaccinated cattle regardless of regime developed good humoral and cell mediated responses prior to challenge. The best overall virus neutralising antibody, IFN-γ and clinical protection (75%) were seen in the cattle whereby the DNA was delivered by electroporation. In contrast, only 25% of cattle vaccinated with the DNA vaccine without electroporation were clinically protected. The addition of GM-CSF in combination with electroporation further improved the efficacy of the vaccine, as demonstrated from the reduction of clinical disease and virus excretions in nasal swabs. We thus demonstrate for the first time that cattle can be clinically protected against FMDV challenge following a DNA prime-protein boost strategy, and particularly when DNA vaccine is combined with GM-CSF and delivered by electroporation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2012

Although type I and II IFNs have proven effective to inhibit foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) replication in swine, a similar approach had only limited efficacy in cattle. Recently, a new family of IFNs, type III IFN or IFN-λ, has been identified in human, mouse, chicken, and swine. We have identified bovine IFN-λ3 (boIFN-λ3), also known as interleukin 28B (IL-28B), and demonstrated that expression of this molecule using a recombinant replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector, Ad5-boIFN-λ3, exhibited antiviral activity against FMDV in bovine cell culture. Furthermore, inoculation of cattle with Ad5-boIFN-λ3 induced systemic antiviral activity and upregulation of IFN-stimulated gene expression in the upper respiratory airways and skin. In the present study, we demonstrated that disease could be delayed for at least 6 days when cattle were inoculated with Ad5-boIFN-λ3 and challenged 24 h later by intradermolingual inoculation with FMDV. Furthermore, the delay in the appearance of disease was significantly prolonged when treated cattle were challenged by aerosolization of FMDV, using a method that resembles the natural route of infection. No clinical signs of FMD, viremia, or viral shedding in nasal swabs was found in the Ad5-boIFN-λ3-treated animals for at least 9 days postchallenge. Our results indicate that boIFN-λ3 plays a critical role in the innate immune response of cattle against FMDV. To this end, this work represents the most successful biotherapeutic strategy so far tested to control FMDV in cattle. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",2012

Here we report that inoculation of swine with this SAP-mutant virus does not cause clinical signs of disease, viremia, or virus shedding even when inoculated at doses 100-fold higher than those required to cause disease with wild-type (WT) virus. Remarkably, SAP-mutant virus-inoculated animals developed a strong neutralizing antibody response and were completely protected against challenge with WT FMDV as early as 2 days postinoculation and for at least 21 days postinoculation. Early protection correlated with a distinct pattern in the serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines in comparison to the levels detected in animals inoculated with WT FMDV that developed disease. In addition, animals inoculated with the FMDV SAP mutant displayed a memory T cell response that resembled infection with WT virus. Our results suggest that Lpro plays a pivotal role in modulating several pathways of the immune response. Furthermore, manipulation of the Lpro coding region may serve as a viable strategy to derive live attenuated strains with potential for development as effective vaccines against foot-and-mouth disease. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.",2012

The occurrence of persistently infected ""carriers"" of FMD-virus (FMDV) in ruminant species adds further complications to disease control. There have been significant discrepancies in reports regarding the pathogenesis of FMDV infection in cattle with specific emphasis on the anatomical sites involved in early and persistent virus replication. In this study, collection of small biopsy samples from the dorsal soft palate (DSP) of live animals was used to investigate the level of FMDV RNA present at this site at sequential time points during the infection. Results were compared to measurements of virus excretion in samples of oropharyngeal fluid collected at corresponding time points. Possible sites of virus persistence were investigated through measurements of the levels of FMDV RNA in the DSP as well as mandibular and retropharyngeal lymph nodes beyond 28 days after infection. Results indicated only low levels of FMDV RNA present in samples of pharyngeal epithelia during both early and persistent phases of infection with significantly higher levels of virus detected in pharyngeal excretions. It is concluded that the targeted area for sampling within the DSP does not harbour significant levels of virus replication during acute or persistent FMDV infection in cattle. Furthermore, the DSP and the mandibular and retropharyngeal lymph nodes cannot be concluded to be principal sites for persistence of FMDV. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",2012

Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) causes an economically important and highly contagious disease of cloven-hoofed animals. FMD control in endemic regions is implemented using chemically inactivated whole-virus vaccines. Currently, efforts are directed to the development of safe and marked vaccines. We have previously reported solid protection against FMDV conferred by branched structures (dendrimeric peptides) harbouring virus-specific B and T-cell epitopes. In order to gain insights into the factors determining a protective immune response against FMDV, in this report we sought to dissect the immunogenicity conferred by different peptide-based immunogens. Thus, we have assessed the immune response and protection elicited in pigs by linear peptides harbouring the same FMDV B-cell or B and T-cell epitopes (B and TB peptides, respectively). Results. Pigs were twice immunized with either the B-cell epitope (site A) peptide or with TB, a peptide where the B-cell epitope was in tandem with the T-cell epitope [3A (21-35)]. Both, B and TB peptides were able to induce specific humoral (including neutralizing antibodies) and cellular immune responses against FMDV, but did not afford full protection in pigs. The data obtained showed that the T-cell epitope used is capable to induce efficient T-cell priming that contributes to improve the protection against FMDV. However, the IgA titres and IFN release elicited by these linear peptides were lower than those detected previously with the dendrimeric peptides. Conclusions. We conclude that the incorporation of a FMDV specific T-cell epitope in the peptide formulation allows a significant reduction in virus excretion and clinical score after challenge. However, the linear TB peptide did not afford full protection in challenged pigs, as that previously reported using the dendrimeric construction indicating that, besides the inclusion of an adecuate T-cell epitope in the formulation, an efficient presentation of the B-cell epitope is crucial to elicit full protection by peptide vaccines. © 2012 Cubillos et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2012

Recently, we demonstrated that inclusion of the complete coding region of nonstructural protein 2B in the Ad5-A24 vector resulted in improved immune responses in pigs. We also found that inclusion of a modified CMV promoter (pCI), Ad5-CI-A24-2B, enhanced the efficacy of the vector. To address the limited immunogenicity of Ad5-O1C, we have produced a new set of Ad5 vectors with the complete 2B coding region under the control of either the original or the modified version of the CMV promoter, Ad5-O1C-2B, or Ad5-CI-O1C-2B, respectively. To evaluate the potency and efficacy of the new vectors we performed 2 sets of experiments in cattle. In the first experiment we compared the original vector with vectors containing the pCI promoter and partial or full-length 2B. All groups were challenged, intradermally in the tongue, at 21dpv with FMDV O1C. We found that in all vaccinated groups 2 of 4 animals were protected from clinical disease. In the second experiment we directly compared the efficacy of vectors with a partial or full-length 2B under the control of the original CMV promoter. While all animals in the control group developed clinical disease, 2 of 4 animals in the group receiving Ad5-O1C vaccine and 3 of 4 animals in the group receiving Ad5-O1C-2B vaccine were completely protected after challenge. We also observed a 100-fold reduction of virus shedding in Ad5-O1C vaccinated animals and the group receiving Ad5-O1C-2B had an additional 10-fold reduction compared with the Ad5-O1C vaccinated group. There was no difference in the level of neutralizing antibodies in the vaccinated groups. However, we detected a significant antigen specific-CD4 + and CD8 + T cell response as early as 1 day post-challenge (dpc) in both Ad5-O1C and Ad5-O1C-2B groups. Interestingly, the group receiving Ad5-O1C-2B had a statistically significant higher antigen specific-CD4 + and CD8 + T cell response at 5dpc and 3 and 5dpc, respectively, as compared to the Ad5-O1C inoculated group. These results indicate that inclusion of the complete 2B coding region improves the efficacy of Ad5 vaccines against FMDV serotype O and induces specific-CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses that correlate with protection. © 2011.",2011

The air sampler used was a handheld prototype device employing electrostatic particle capture in a microchip chamber of 10-15 μL and was shown to effectively capture a high percentage of airborne microorganisms. The particles were eluted subsequently from the chip chamber and subjected to real-time RT-PCR. Sampling exhaled air for as little as 1. min allowed the detection of FMDV in cattle infected experimentally. Detection in exhaled air from individual cattle was compared to FMDV detection in serum and saliva for 3 different strains of FMDV (O1/Manisa/69, C/Oberbayern/FRG/1960 and SAT1/Zimbawe/1989). Detection of FMDV in exhaled air was possible for all strains of FMDV used for experimental infection but the period that detection was possible varied among the strains.

Feral swine were proved to be highly susceptible to A-24 Cruzeiro FMD virus by intradermal inoculation and by contact with infected domestic and feral swine. Typical clinical signs in feral swine included transient fever, lameness and vesicular lesions in the coronary bands, heel bulbs, tip of the tongue and snout. Domestic swine exhibited clinical signs of the disease within 24h after contact with feral swine, whereas feral swine did not show clinical signs of FMD until 48h after contact with infected domestic and feral swine.

To evaluate the accuracy of such predictions, we compared the protection afforded to cattle vaccinated with the O1 Manisa strain of FMDV against challenge with either a homologous (O1 Manisa) or a heterologous strain (O1 Campos). Serology by virus neutralization test (VNT) using O1 Manisa antiserum predicted an acceptable protection against such a challenge. Two experiments were carried out to compare the results for consistency. A total of 78 naïve cattle were vaccinated with different antigen payloads (60-0.94μg) of O1 Manisa. They were challenged by intradermolingual inoculation with live FMDV, either O1 Manisa or O1 Campos. Unvaccinated naïve control cattle (n=20) were also challenged with either the O1 Manisa or O1 Campos viruses and all developed generalized FMD. The protection results for the vaccinated cattle revealed that higher payloads of O1 Manisa vaccine were needed to protect against heterologous challenge compared to that for homologous challenge. The 50% protective dose (PD50) values for the vaccine in experiments 1 and 2 were found to be 28.78 and 9.44 for the homologous challenge and 3.98 and 5.01 for heterologous challenge. Furthermore, protection against O1 Campos required a higher level of vaccine-induced antibody against this virus compared to the level of O1 Manisa neutralizing antibody associated with protection against homologous challenge. The 50% protective level of in vitro neutralizing antibody was found to be log101.827 for O1 Campos and log100.954 for O1 Manisa based on O1 Manisa based virus neutralization test. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.",2011

It is caused by a picornavirus, foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), which has a positive sense RNA genome which, when introduced into cells, can initiate virus replication. Principal Findings: A system has been developed to rescue infectious FMDV from RNA preparations generated from clinical samples obtained under experimental conditions and then applied to samples collected in the ""field"". Clinical samples from suspect cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) were obtained from within Pakistan and Afghanistan. The samples were treated to preserve the RNA and then transported to National Veterinary Institute, Lindholm, Denmark. Following RNA extraction, FMDV RNA was quantified by real-time RT-PCR and samples containing significant levels of FMDV RNA were introduced into susceptible cells using electroporation. Progeny viruses were amplified in primary bovine thyroid cells and characterized using antigen ELISA and also by RT-PCR plus sequencing. FMD viruses of three different serotypes and multiple lineages have been successfully rescued from the RNA samples. Two of the rescued viruses (of serotype O and Asia 1) were inoculated into bull calves under high containment conditions. Acute clinical disease was observed in each case which spread rapidly from the inoculated calves to in-contact animals. Thus the rescued viruses were highly pathogenic. The availability of the rescued viruses enabled serotyping by antigen ELISA and facilitated genome sequencing. Conclusions: The procedure described here should improve the characterization of FMDVs circulating in countries where the disease is endemic and thus enhance disease control globally. © 2011 Belsham et al.",2011

Current inactivated vaccines require approximately 7 days to induce protection, but before this time vaccinated animals remain susceptible to disease. Previously, we demonstrated that intramuscular (IM) inoculation of a replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) vector containing a porcine interferon α gene (pIFNα) can protect swine challenged 1 day later by intradermal (ID) injection with FMDV A24 Cruzeiro from both clinical disease and virus replication. To extend these studies to other FMDV serotypes, we demonstrated the effectiveness of Ad5-pIFNα against ID challenge with O1 Manisa and Asia-1 and against A24 Cruzeiro in a direct contact challenge model. We also showed that an Ad5 vector containing the pIFNβ gene can protect swine against ID challenge with A24 Cruzeiro. Further, IM inoculation of a 10-fold lower dose of Ad5-pIFNα at 4 sites in the neck compared with 1 site in the hind limb can protect swine against ID challenge. These studies demonstrate the ability of Ad5-delivered type I IFN to rapidly protect swine against several FMDV serotypes and suggest that various modifications of this approach may enable this strategy to be successfully used in other FMD susceptible species. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2011

It contained three copies each of residues 141 to 160 and 200 to 213 of VP1 of the O/China/99 strain of FMDV coupled with a swine immunoglobulin G heavy-chain constant region (scIgG). The data showed that the multiple-epitope recombinant vaccine elicited high titers of anti-FMDV specific antibodies in swine at 30 days postvaccination (dpv) and conferred complete protection against a challenge with 103 50% swine infective doses of the O/China/99 strain. The anti-FMDV specific antibody titers were not significantly different between the multiple-epitope recombinant vaccine and the traditional vaccine (t test, P &gt; 0.05). The number of 50% pig protective doses was 6.47, which is higher than the number recommended by the World Organization for Animal Health.

Samples were collected from each steer antemortem (serum, nasal swabs, and oral swabs) and postmortem (up to 40 tissues per animal) and screened for FMDV by virus isolation and for FMDV RNA by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Tissues that tested positive for FMDV or viral RNA were examined by immunohistochemistry and multichannel immunofluorescence microscopy. In previremic steers, FMDV was most consistently localized to nasopharyngeal tissues, thereby indicating this region as the most important site of primary viral replication. The earliest site of microscopic localization of FMDV antigens was the lymphoid follicle-associated epithelium of the pharyngeal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue of the nasopharynx at 6 hours postaerosolization. At early time points after aerosol inoculation, viral antigens colocalized with cytokeratin-positive pharyngeal epithelial cells; intraepithelial FMDV-negative, MHCII/CD11c-double-positive dendritic cells were present in close proximity to FMDV-positive cells. Onset of viremia coincided with marked increase of viral loads in pulmonary tissues and with substantial decrease of viral detection in nasopharyngeal tissues. These data indicate that subsequent to aerogenous exposure to FMDV, the temporally defined critical pathogenesis events involve (1) primary replication in epithelial cells of the pharyngeal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue crypts and (2) subsequent widespread replication in pneumocytes in the lungs, which coincides with (3) the establishment of sustained viremia. © 2010 The American College of Veterinary Pathologists.",2010

Five different RPV genomic targets were examined, and one was selected and optimized to detect viral RNA in infected tissue culture fluid with a level of detection ranging from 0.59 to 87.5 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID 50) per reaction depending on the viral isolate. The strain sensitivity of the test was validated on 16 RPV strains belonging to all three phylogenetic branches described for RPV. No cross-reactivity was detected with closely related peste des petit ruminants or with symptomatically similar viruses, including all seven serotypes of foot-and-mouth disease virus, two serotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus, bluetongue virus, and bovine herpes virus type 2. In samples from experimentally infected cattle, our real-time RT-PCR test was significantly more sensitive than the gold standard test of virus isolation, allowing the detection of the disease 2 to 4 days prior to the appearance of clinical signs. The comparison of clinical samples with putative diagnostic value from live animals showed that conjunctival swabs and blood buffy coat were the samples of choice for epidemiological surveillance, while lymph nodes performed the best as post-mortem specimens. This portable and rapid real-time RT-PCR has the capability of the preclinical detection of RPV and provides differential diagnosis from look-alike diseases of cattle. As RPV is declared globally eradicated, this test provides an important rapid virus detection tool that does not require the use of infectious virus and allows the processing of a large number of samples.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock that inflicts severe economic losses. Although the current whole-virus chemically inactivated vaccine has proven effective, it has led to new outbreaks of FMD because of incomplete inactivation of the virus or the escape of infectious virus from vaccine production premises. We have previously shown that serial passages of FMD virus (FMDV) C-S8c1 at high multiplicity of infection in cell culture resulted in virus populations consisting of defective genomes that are infectious by complementation (termed C-S8p260). Principal Finding: Here we evaluate the immunogenicity of C-S8p260, first in a mouse model system to establish a proof of principle, and second, in swine, the natural host of FMDV C-S8c1. Mice were completely protected against a lethal challenge with FMDV C-S8c1, after vaccination with a single dose of C-S8p260. Pigs immunized with different C-S8p260 doses and challenged with FMDV C-S8c1 either did not develop any clinical signs or showed delayed and mild disease symptoms. C-S8p260 induced high titers of both FMDV-specific, neutralizing antibodies and activated FMDV-specific T cells in swine, that correlated with solid protection against FMDV. Conclusions: The defective virus-based vaccine did not produce detectable levels of transmissible FMDV. Therefore, a segmented, replication-competent form of a virus, such as FMDV C-S8p260, can provide the basis of a new generation of attenuated antiviral vaccines with two safety barriers. The design can be extended to any viral pathogen that encodes trans-acting gene products, allowing complementation between replication-competent, defective forms. © 2010 Rodríguez-Calvo et al.",2010

Persistent viral infection (carriers) was detected by antigen capture RT-PCR on the oesophageal-pharyngeal fluid. Viral excretion was found to be intermittent and strongly variable among the persistently infected Indian cattle. Lymphocyte proliferative (LP) response, assessed as reactivity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to FMDV Asia 1 antigen (Ag) was of low magnitude indicating a weak primary cellular immune response following infection. LP response to FMDV Ag was higher among the non-carriers than carriers of FMDV Asia 1. An enhanced LP response was associated with the lack of virus shedding in the OPF.

Control of the disease involves the use of killed-virus vaccines, a control measure developed decades ago. After natural infection, the primary site of replication of FMDV is the pharyngeal area, suggesting that a mucosal immune response is the most effective. Humoral immunity to killed-virus vaccination induces antibodies that can prevent the clinical disease but not local infection. Determining whether infection or vaccination stimulates IgA-mediated local immunity depends on the method of analysis. Different assays have been described to analyze the quality of antibody responses of cattle and swine to FMDV, including indirect double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IDAS-ELISA) and antibody capture assay-ELISA (ACAELISA). We tested these assays on swine and show that vaccinated animals had FMDV-specific IgM and IgG but no IgA in either serum or saliva. After the infection, both assays detected FMDV-specific IgM, IgG, and IgA in serum. Notably, serum IgA was more readily detected using the ACA-ELISA, whereas IgA was not detected in saliva with this assay. FMDV-specific IgA antibodies were detected in saliva samples using the IDAS-ELISA. These data show that parenterally administered, killed-virus vaccine does not induce a mucosal antibody response to FMDV and illuminates limitations and appropriate applications of the two ELISAs used to measure FMDV-specific responses. Further, the presence of the IgA antivirus in serum correlates with the presence of such antibodies in saliva. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.",2010

The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on sheath washes, vesicular fluid, supernatant and cell-rich fractions of semen from day 10 to day 26 postinfection (p.i.). Bulls that were positive by PCR on the whole semen sample collected on day 28 p.i. were slaughtered and tissue samples from their genital tracts submitted for histopathological evaluation, immunoperoxidase staining, virus isolation and PCR. Two of the bulls developed severe lumpy skin disease (LSD) and were found to be shedding viral DNA in their semen on day 28 p.i. Viral DNA was identified in all semen fractions from all bulls, but mostly from the cell-rich fraction and from the severely affected bulls. The PCR assay was positive on postmortem samples of testes and epididymides from the two severely affected bulls. Virus could be recovered from the testes of these two bulls and from the epididymis of one of them. Immunoperoxidase staining was positive for LSDV staining in sections of testes and epididymides exhibiting necrosis.

We conclude that immunisation with a single inoculation of vaccine from the UK emergency reserve can protect cattle from clinical disease for at least 6 months post-vaccination and that a boost may be unnecessary in an outbreak situation. Some animals may become sub-clinically infected but this is likely to be dependent on the severity of challenge.

An experimental oil adjuvant O1 Manisa FMD vaccine protected sheep and goats from clinical disease from 7 days post vaccination following 24 hours of direct in-contact exposure to four infected donor sheep or goats. Goats required lower antibody titres for protection when compared with sheep. Protection from clinical disease did not prevent localized viral replication in goats and at least two goats had viral RNA detected on day 28 post challenge. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that the level of virus replication shortly after direct incontact challenge in oropharynx and nasal secretions of vaccinated animals was reduced by 100 and 1000 times respectively when compared with unvaccinated controls. The findings also show that after direct in-contact challenge, use of FMD vaccine will prevent or reduce local virus replication, thereby significantly reduce the amount of virus released into the environment in the all-important early post-exposure period.

An experimental oil adjuvant O1 Manisa FMD vaccine protected sheep and goats from clinical disease from 7 days post vaccination following 24 hours of direct in-contact exposure to four infected donor sheep or goats. Goats required lower antibody titres for protection when compared with sheep. Protection from clinical disease did not prevent localized viral replication in goats and at least two goats had viral RNA detected on day 28 post challenge. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction showed that the level of virus replication shortly after direct incontact challenge in oropharynx and nasal secretions of vaccinated animals was reduced by 100 and 1000 times respectively when compared with unvaccinated controls. The findings also show that after direct in-contact challenge, use of FMD vaccine will prevent or reduce local virus replication, thereby significantly reduce the amount of virus released into the environment in the all-important early post-exposure period. There is low risk of vaccinated animals transmitting disease as live virus could not be readily isolated. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.",2010

Since the late 1990s, the genetic lineage of PanAsia topotype FMDV serotype O has caused epidemics in the Far East, Africa, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, and numerous other countries throughout Europe and Asia. In contrast, there are several FMDV isolates that exhibit a more restricted host range. A Cathay topotype isolate of FMDV serotype O from the 1997 epizootic in Taiwan (O/TAW/97) demonstrated restricted host specificity, only infecting swine. Methods used to evaluate infectivity and pathogenicity of FMDV isolates in cattle are well-documented, but there has been less progress studying transmission and pathogenicity of FMDV isolates in pigs. In previous studies designed to examine pathogenicity, various chimeric viruses derived from O/TAW/97 were intradermally inoculated in the heel bulb of pigs. Subsequent quantitative scoring of disease and evaluation of virus released into nasal secretions and blood was assessed. Here we prove the usefulness of this method in direct and contact inoculated pigs to evaluate infectivity, pathogenicity and transmission of different Asian FMDV isolates. Virus strains within the Cathay topotype were highly virulent in swine producing a synchronous disease in inoculated animals and were efficiently spread to in-contact naïve pigs, while virus strains from the PanAsia topotype displayed more heterogeneous properties.",2010

Though FMDV is very sensitive to interferon-α (IFN-α), IFN-β, and IFN-γ, the virus has evolved mechanisms to evade such innate responses. For instance, during acute infection, FMDV suppresses IFN-α production by skin and myeloid dendritic cells (DCs). We have previously reported that FMDV infection induces a transient lymphopenia and interruption of T-lymphocyte responses to mitogenic stimuli. To further understand the immunopathogenesis of FMD, we have now analyzed the serum IFN-α response in relation to lymphopenia, and the number and function of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) following infection of pigs with multiple serotypes of FMDV. Serum IFN-α peaked 2-3d post-infection (PI), regardless of FMDV serotype. Lymphopenia coincided with peak viremia and the serum IFN-α response. Circulating pDC numbers and in-vitro pDC IFN-α secretion transiently declined by 48h following infection. Infection of lymphocytes or pDCs was never detected regardless of the FMDV serotype inoculated or the age of the animal infected. These data indicate that, like other DC subsets, there is suppression of interferon production by pDCs, which abrogates this important innate response. Rapid induction of serum IFN-α, albeit short-lived, may contribute to the rapid resolution of FMDV viremia prior to induction of specific immunity. © 2010 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",2010

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of protection induced by IFNs, we inoculated groups of six swine with Ad5-vectors containing these genes, challenged 1 day later and euthanized 2 animals from each group prior to (1 day postinoculation [dpi]) and at 1 (2 dpi) and 6 days postchallenge (7 dpi). Blood, skin, and lymphoid tissues were examined for IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) induction and infiltration by innate immune cells. All IFN-inoculated animals had delayed and decreased clinical signs and viremia compared to the controls, and one animal in the IFN-α treated group did not develop disease. At 1 and 2 dpi the groups inoculated with the IFNs had increased numbers of dendritic cells and natural killer cells in the skin and lymph nodes, respectively, as well as increased levels of several ISGs compared to the controls. In particular, all tissues examined from IFN-treated groups had significant upregulation of the chemokine 10-kDa IFN-γ-inducible protein 10, and preferential upregulation of 2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase, Mx1, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. There was also upregulation of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 and macrophage inflammatory protein 3α in the skin. These data suggest that there is a complex interplay between IFN-induced immunomodulatory and antiviral activities in protection of swine against FMDV.

When tested by aerosol inoculation in cattle (3 animals per virus), the deletion mutant was fully virulent as was A24-WT. Mutant viruses containing insertions in inter-AUG did not cause clinical disease or viremia. However, viruses that partially or totally removed the tn insertion during animal infection reverted to virulence in 2 inoculated steers.

To do this, we consider the experimental data on the concentration of FMD virus genomes in the blood (viral load). In this experiment, 12 pigs were inoculated with one of three different doses of FMD virus: low; medium; or high. Measurements of the viral load were recorded over a time course of approximately 11 days for every 8 hours. The model is a set of deterministic differential equations with the following variables: viral load; virus in the interstitial space; and the proportion of epithelial cells available for infection, infected and uninfected. The model was fitted to the data for each animal individually and also simultaneously over all animals varying only the initial dose. We showthat the general trend in the data can be explained by varying only the initial dose.

We therefore now generated VHH3s containing an additional FMDV binding VHH. Two VHH3s neutralized FMDV more potently than single VHHs and were highly produced by yeast cells. Injection of a mixture of these two VHH3s 24 h before FMD challenge infection of pigs reduced and delayed the development of clinical disease, viraemia and viral shedding.

An ∼8.2 kb PCR product was amplified from the cDNA clone and a full-length RNA was generated from it by in vitro transcription. Transfection of BHK-21 cells with the in vitro transcripts resulted in the production of infectious recombinant FMDV particles as evidenced by cytopathic effects (CPE). Further, characterization of the recombinant virus by immunofluorescence, microneutralization test (MNT), antigen ELISA, RT-PCR, plaque assay and electron microscopy revealed similarity to the parental strain. The immunogenicity of an oil-adjuvant vaccine prepared using the inactivated recombinant virus was tested in guinea pigs and cattle. Neutralizing antibodies were produced in both vaccinated guinea pigs and cattle. Vaccinated animals were protected on challenge.

We compared vaccine efficacy in groups of pigs in which vaccine administration differed with respect to antigen payload of the vaccine, administrated volume and administration route. When compared with pigs that were IM vaccinated with a full dose vaccine with a standard antigen payload, pigs vaccinated ID with 1/10 dose of the same vaccine were equally protected against clinical disease and subclinical virus shedding. The ID vaccinated pigs were protected against virus shedding at a significant lower VN-titre as compared to IM vaccinated pigs, suggesting that immune responses other than neutralising antibodies also contributed to protection. We conclude that the ID route might be a good alternative for IM application, as ID application might induce a very efficient immunological response against FMD and, moreover, because the dose required by the ID route is lower compared to the IM route, ID application may reduce the production costs per dose of FMD vaccine markedly. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Cytokine mRNA responses in microdissected epithelia from the bovine tongue, coronary band and dorsal soft palate during the acute stage of FMDV infection were different. Significantly increased expression of cytokine mRNA was found in microdissected epithelia from the coronary band and tongue of FMDV-infected cattle and the extent of cytokine mRNA induction correlated with viral RNA loads. The results suggest that epithelia from different sites of an infected animal may mount different defences following infection and this may contribute to differences in their relative capacities to clear the virus. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We aim to develop an immunotherapy that confers rapid protection against FMD in outbreak situations. For this purpose, we previously isolated llama single-domain antibody fragments (VHHs) binding to FMDV or porcine immunoglobulin (pIg). The pIg binding VHHs can be genetically fused to other VHHs, resulting in so-called VHH2s. As compared to non-pIg binding VHHs such VHH2s have a 100-fold increased serum half-life which is essential for effective immunotherapy. We have now produced three bispecific VHH2s by fusion of three FMDV binding VHHs (clones M3, M8 and M23) to a pIg binding VHH (VI-4). The resulting yeast-produced VHH2s bound FMDV and pIg with high affinity (KD about 1 nM) and neutralized FMDV in vitro as efficiently as their monovalent counterparts. To evaluate their therapeutic potential all three VHH2s were intramuscularly injected into pigs that were challenge infected with FMDV 24 h later. Administration of one of these VHH2s (M23ggsVI-4) reduced the viremia significantly (P = 0.0034) and reduced viral shedding almost significantly (P = 0.11). However, it did not prevent development of clinical signs or transmission of FMDV. These results suggest that immunotherapy using bispecific VHH2s binding to FMDV and pIg is possible in principle, but should be improved by increasing VHH2 dosage or using more potent VHH2s. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Out of 17 animals infected by the intradermo-lingual route, 12 became persistently infected (carriers), as defined by positive antigen capture RT-PCR reactions for FMDV RNA in OPF samples collected at 28 days or later after exposure. This proportion of carriers (71%) with FMDV Asia 1 is comparable to other serotypes of the virus. When the two groups were examined, the carriers and non-carriers showed no difference in the serum antibody titre until the end of the experiment at 182 days post-infection (DPI). However, despite an initial similarity significantly higher neutralizing antibody titres and FMDV-specific IgA response were detected among the carriers than the non-carriers in both of the secretory fluids. The response was higher and more stable in ONF compared to OPF. Thus, mucosal antibody assays have the potential to be used as a means of differentiating carrier from non-carrier cattle. Furthermore, the findings are consistent with the higher mucosal antibody response in carriers being an effect of persistent infection rather than the cause. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To facilitate the study of lumpy skin disease pathogenesis, we inoculated eight 4- to 6-month-old Holstein calves intravenously with lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) and collected samples over a period of 42 days for analysis by virus isolation, real-time PCR and light microscopy. Following inoculation, cattle developed fever and skin nodules, with the extent of infection varying between animals. Skin nodules remained visible until the end of the experiment on day post-inoculation (DPI) 42. Viremia measured by real-time PCR and virus isolation was not observed in all animals but was detectable between 6 and 15 DPI. Low levels of viral shedding were observed in oral and nasal secretions between 12 and 18 DPI. Several tissues were assessed for the presence of virus at DPI 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 42 by virus isolation and real-time PCR. Virus was consistently detected by real-time PCR and virus isolation at high levels in skin nodules indicating LSDV has a tropism for skin. In contrast, relatively few lesions were observed systemically. Viral DNA was detected by real-time PCR in skin lesions collected on DPI 42. Cattle developing anti-capripoxvirus antibodies starting at DPI 21 was detected by serum neutralization. The disease in this study varied from mild with few secondary skin nodules to generalized infection of varying severity, and was characterized by morbidity with no mortality. © 2008 The Authors.",2008

Viable virus was detected in aerosol emissions for 3 days regardless of the strain or dose of virus given. No correlation was found between the peak level of virus emission and dose, but pigs infected with a lower dose of virus had a delayed onset of aerosol emission and emitted a greater total amount of aerosolised virus. Irrespective of the dose, both the total amount and the peak level of virus emission were higher from pigs infected with C Noville compared to those infected with O UKG. The results suggest that care should be taken when extrapolating from laboratory derived data to the field; this is particularly the case in the early days of an outbreak when the aerosol characteristics of the virus involved may be unknown and the amount of virus that an individual animal has been challenged with remains uncertain.

To mimic an emergency vaccination regime in the field, sheep were vaccinated with O1 Manisa vaccine and 4 or 10 days later were indirectly challenged with aerosols from O1 UKG FMDV infected pigs. Vaccinated and control unvaccinated sheep were monitored for a minimum of 39 days post-challenge. The vaccinated sheep became sub-clinically infected, with reduced virus replication and excretion compared to unvaccinated and clinically infected sheep. Seroconversion to NSP was weak and transient in sheep in which virus replication was of low level and short duration. Virus transmission from vaccinated sub-clinically infected sheep to introduced vaccinated sentinels was not sufficient to cause NSP seroconversion or significant virus shedding. 10% of 10 days and 20% of 4 days vaccinated sheep were virus carriers at greater than 28 days post-challenge compared to 37.5% in the unvaccinated and clinically infected sheep. These results suggest that the low levels of virus replication likely if an effective vaccine is administered at least 4 days prior to challenge exposure are unlikely to result in the spread of infection even under intensive management conditions. Although it may be difficult to detect this infection by serosurveillance, the significance of missing it is likely to be low and the main value of such testing will be to detect undisclosed clinical infection resulting from lack of observation or from exposure to virus before or very soon after vaccination or from vaccine failure due to maladministration or inappropriate strain selection. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In contrast, FMD in lambs has been reported to cause high mortality during field outbreaks. In order to investigate the pathogenesis of FMD in lambs, two groups, aged 10-14 days, were infected with foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) type O UKG. One group of lambs (n = 8) was inoculated with FMDV in the coronary band, while the other (n = 4) was infected by direct contact with FMDV-inoculated ewes. Daily serum samples and temperature measurements were taken. Lambs were killed sequentially and tissue samples taken for analysis. Using real-time RT-PCR, viral RNA levels in tissue samples and serum were measured, and a novel strand-specific real-time RT-PCR assay was used to quantify viral replication levels in tissues. Tissue sections were examined for histopathological lesions, and in situ hybridisation (ISH) was used to localise viral RNA within histological sections. The contact-infected lambs became infected approximately 24 h after the ewes were inoculated. Vesicular lesions developed on the feet of all lambs and on the caudo-lateral part of the tongues of six of the eight inoculated lambs and three of the four contact-infected lambs. Although no lambs developed severe clinical signs, one of the contact-infected lambs died acutely at 5 days post-exposure. Histological examination of the heart from this lamb showed multi-focal areas of lymphocytic-plasmacytic myocarditis; similar lesions were also observed in the hearts of three of the inoculated lambs. Using ISH, viral RNA was localised within cardiac and skeletal muscle cells from the lamb which had died, and also from vesicular lesions on the coronary band and tongue of inoculated lambs.

This study investigates the pathogenesis of FMDV infection in ovine fetuses using in-situ hybridization (ISH) to detect viral transcripts in tissue and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays to quantify the fetal cytokine response to infection. FMDV ribonucleic acid (RNA) was localized mainly to the heart and skeletal muscles of fetuses and was only occasionally expressed in the lingual epithelium, demonstrating that FMDV has a different tissue tropism in the fetus compared with that in adult sheep. There was early expression of genes encoding anti-viral cytokines (IFN-α and IFN-β) in fetuses at 2 and 4 days post-infection (dpi), followed by a marked rise in the transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-1α) from 7 to 18 dpi, particularly in the heart. The degree of cytokine mRNA expression correlated with fetal infection and was likely to be a factor in fetal death. In contrast, cytokine gene expression in infected neonatal lambs was much less and mainly occurred between 2 and 4 dpi. This study identifies two key factors in the pathogenicity of FMDV in fetal lambs: viral tropism for cardiac and skeletal muscles, and a marked cytokine response following infection. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The method uses three primer sets, each one specific for the corresponding virus, selected to detect of all serotypes of FMD and VS. The detection range was confirmed by examination of a collection of 31 isolates of the three target viruses. The specificity of the assay was also demonstrated by testing other related viruses, uninfected cell line cultures and healthy pig tissues. The testing of blood and serum samples from animals infected experimentally proved that the method can be useful for early diagnosis of the diseases, even before the first vesicular lesions are visualized in the infected pigs. An assessment of the performance of the multiplex RT-PCR was carried out using a panel of more than 100 samples from animals infected experimentally, showing the suitability of the method for a rapid (less than 6 h), sensitive and specific differential diagnosis in clinical samples. Additionally, a uniplex RT-PCR for VSV, that amplifies the two viral serotypes, was also developed and tested as a rapid tool for the diagnosis of this vesicular disease. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The other aims of this study were to verify the existence of sub-clinical infection in vaccinated pigs, to evaluate the correlation between this and seroconversion to foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) non-structural protein antibodies and to re-examine the occurrence of FMDV persistence in the oro-pharynx of pigs. Therefore, pigs were vaccinated (O1 Manisa) and challenged (O1 UKG) in a manner calculated to produce a broad range of clinical outcomes and were monitored for a minimum of another 33 days post-challenge. Eighty-one percent of the early (10 days vaccinated) challenged pigs and 25% of the late (29 days vaccinated) challenged pigs were clinically infected and all other vaccinated pigs were sub-clinically infected. Although vaccination could not provide complete clinical or virological protection, it reduced the severity of the disease, virus excretion and production of non-structural FMDV antibodies in vaccinated and subsequently infected pigs.

Regardless of antigen payload, vaccination was shown to significantly reduce the number of clinically infected animals, and significantly reduce virus excretion shortly after challenge, when compared with the unvaccinated group (P < 0.05). Although FMDV transmission occurred from single strength vaccinated infected cattle to similarly vaccinated cattle held in indirect contact, no disease was induced in these animals. These studies further confirm that emergency vaccination does significantly reduce clinical disease and sub-clinical virus replication and excretion, particularly early post exposure, thereby reducing the possibility of transmission between animals and herds. To be most effective, however, the results also substantiate that time of vaccination prior to challenge significantly influences the number of animals becoming infected, so the decision to vaccinate should be made swiftly, to allow maximum opportunity for protective immunity to develop. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Previous experiments showed that intradermal injection of pigs with FMD virus 14 days after vaccination was not suitable to start an infection chain, as inoculated vaccinated pigs resisted challenge. Therefore, we carried out two experiments in which we used direct contact to a non-vaccinated pig as route of infection. In the first experiment only the vaccine effect on susceptibility was quantified by exposing pigs, either vaccinated 14 days before or not vaccinated, each to a non-vaccinated seeder pig inoculated with FMD virus O/NET/2001. Since no significant differences were observed between contact infections in vaccinated or non-vaccinated pigs, we performed a second experiment in which both susceptibility and infectivity were subject to vaccination. We quantified virus transmission in homogenous groups of vaccinated or non-vaccinated pigs in which the infection chain was started by exposure to a third group of non-vaccinated infected pigs. Transmission occurred to all contact-exposed pigs in the non-vaccinated groups and to 9 out of 10 contact-exposed pigs in the vaccinated groups. The rate of transmission (β) was significantly reduced in the vaccine group. Yet, the estimated reproduction ratio in both groups was still above 1. In conclusion, by adjusting our transmission study design and challenge method, we were able to quantify transmission of FMDV among vaccinated pigs. According to this study a single vaccination was not sufficient to stop pig to pig virus transmission. With these results major outbreaks may still be expected, even in groups of vaccinated pigs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2007

We therefore quantified virus transmission by performing experiments with FMD virus strain O/NET/2001 in groups of lambs. We used six groups of four lambs each, in which half of each group was inoculated and the other half was contact-exposed. To quantify the effectiveness of a single vaccination we also included six groups of four lambs each, vaccinated with O Manisa vaccine, 14 days prior to inoculation. Oropharyngeal fluid was obtained with a swab (OPF-swab), and blood samples were collected daily to determine virus excretion and serological response. We calculated the transmission rate β (the number of new infections per day per infectious animal), and the reproduction ratio R (the number of secondary infections caused by one infectious individual). The mean daily virus excretion and the number of days the lambs excreted virus in the OPF differed significantly between vaccinated and non-vaccinated lambs. The transmission rate β in the unvaccinated groups was 0.105 (95% confidence limit 0.044; 0.253) per day. The duration of the infectious period (T) was 21.11 (95% confidence limit 10.6; 42.1) days. With the final size of infection we estimated the reproduction ratio R in the non-vaccinated groups to be 1.14 (0.3; 3.3), and in vaccinated groups 0.22 (0.01; 1.78). Virus transmission as quantified by the final size did not differ statistically between the vaccinated and the non-vaccinated groups of lambs. In conclusion, FMDV seems able to persist in a sheep population, although the reproduction ratio was only slightly larger than one. As a consequence, vaccination might only have a small effect on transmission, in spite of the fact that virus excretion and duration of virus excretion is significantly reduced after vaccination. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The persistent state was established experimentally with plaque-purified FMDV, strain O1Campos, in five buffalos (Bubalus bubalis). Viral isolates collected from esophageal-pharyngeal (EP) fluids for up to 71 weeks after infection were analyzed at different times by nucleotide sequencing and T1 RNase oligonucleotide fingerprinting to assess variability in the VP1-coding region and in the complete genome, respectively. Genetic variation increased, although irregularly, with time after infection. The highest values observed for the VP1-coding region and for the whole genome were 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively. High rates of fixation of mutations were observed using both methodologies, reaching values of 0.65 substitutions per nucleotide per year (s/nt/y) and 0.44 s/nt/y for nucleotide sequencing and oligonucleotide fingerprinting, respectively, when selected samples recovered at close time periods were analyzed.

We used three groups of ten pigs, one non-vaccinated group, one group vaccinated with a single dose vaccine and one group vaccinated with a four-fold dose vaccine. At 7 days post vaccination, five pigs per group were challenged intra-dermally with FMDV O TAW 3/97 and the remaining pigs of each group were contact-exposed to the inoculated pigs. In each group, virus excretion and number of contact infections were quantified. The serological and mucosal antibody responses were evaluated until 116 days post infection. Vaccination resulted in a significant decrease of virus excretion. Stepwise linear regression analysis of variables from individual vaccinated pigs revealed the virus excretion after challenge to be correlated with neutralising antibody titres at the day of challenge (p < 0.01). In serum and OPF samples comparable isotype-specific antibody responses (IgM, IgG and IgA), could be detected after vaccination as well as after infection. Remarkably, the pigs with the highest IgA responses after vaccination were protected against contact exposure. After infection, a long lasting (up to 116 dpi) IgA response was seen in the non-vaccinated and to a lesser extent in the single dose vaccinated pigs. The induction of NSP antibodies in the vaccinated pigs after infection was lower and of shorter duration as compared to the non-vaccinated infected pigs. This experiment shows that vaccination can reduce virus excretion in pigs, which will contribute to reduced transmission of FMDV in the field, even if the pigs are not fully protected. Moreover, vaccines that induce local IgA responses may be more effective, which merits further investigation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2007

Half of both groups were intranasally inoculated, with FMDV field isolate O/NET2001, and housed with the other half of the group (contact-exposed cows) from the next day onwards. Virus transmission was quantified by estimating the reproduction ratio R, which is the average number of secondary cases caused by one infectious animal. In the non-vaccinated groups all cows became infected and Rnv was significantly above 1. In the vaccinated groups infection was demonstrated in three inoculated cows, and no transmission was observed (Rv was 0, not significantly below 1). Transmission was significantly reduced in the groups of vaccinated cows when compared to the groups of unvaccinated cows.

The work presented here investigates this possibility further using cattle and a more severe semi-heterologous direct contact challenge. The quantitative dynamics of virus replication and excretion in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle following challenge are examined. Two experiments were carried out each involving 20 vaccinated and 5 non-vaccinated cattle. An O 1 Manisa vaccine (18 PD50) was used for the first, previously reported experiment [Cox SJ, Voyce C, Parida S, Reid SM, Hamblin PA, Paton DJ, et al. Protection against direct contact challenge following emergency FMD vaccination of cattle and the effect on virus excretion from the oropharynx. Vaccine 2005;23:1106-13]. The same vaccine was used for the second experiment described in this paper except the antigen payload was increased 10-fold per bovine dose, resulting in significantly higher FMD virus neutralising antibody titres prior to challenge. Twenty-one days post-vaccination the cattle received a 5-day direct contact challenge with FMD virus from five further non-vaccinated cattle infected 24 h earlier with O UKG 34/2001. All vaccinated cattle regardless of antigen payload were protected against clinical disease. Sub-clinical oropharyngeal infection was detected in animals from both experiments but the level of virus replication shortly after direct contact challenge was significantly reduced in vaccinated animals. Cattle immunised with the 10-fold antigen payload cleared the virus more readily and consequently at 28 days post-challenge fewer animals were persistently infected compared to the single strength vaccine. Following a severe challenge, the results from both experiments show that use of emergency vaccine can prevent or decrease local virus replication and thereby dramatically reduce the amount of virus released into the environment, particularly during the early post-exposure period. Additionally, increasing the antigen payload of the vaccine may reduce sub-clinical infection, leading to fewer persistently infected virus carrier animals. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Because of the limited effectiveness of existing vaccines and antiviral drugs, the development of new strategies is needed. RNA interference (RNAi) is an effective means of suppressing virus replication in vitro. Here we demonstrate that treatment with recombinant, replication-defective human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) expressing short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) directed against either structural protein 1D (Ad5-NT21) or polymerase 3D (Ad5-POL) of FMDV totally protects swine IBRS-2 cells from homologous FMDV infection, whereas only Ad5-POL inhibits heterologous FMDV replication. Moreover, delivery of these shRNAs significantly reduces the susceptibility of guinea pigs and swine to FMDV infection. Three of five guinea pigs inoculated with 106 PFU of Ad5-POL and challenged 24 h later with 50 50% infectious doses (ID50) of homologous virus were protected from the major clinical manifestation of disease: the appearance of vesicles on the feet. Two of three swine inoculated with an Ad5-NT21-Ad5-POL mixture containing 2 × 109 PFU each and challenged 24 h later with 100 ID50 of homologous virus were protected from the major clinical disease, but treatment with a higher dose of adenovirus mixture cannot promote protection of animals. The inhibition was rapid and specific because treatment with a control adenovirus construct (Ad5-LacZ) expressing Escherichia coli galactosidase-specific shRNA showed no marked antiviral activity.

The quantity of interferon gamma (IFN-γ) produced in the supernatants was measured using an ELISA. Specific induction of IFN-γ was detected in samples from vaccinated, infected and vaccinated-then-infected cattle. Further development of this assay may provide a useful tool for the diagnosis of FMDV immune animals, including the identification of vaccinated animals that have been subsequently infected with FMDV. In these studies, combining the results of the IFN-γ assay with virus neutralising antibody titre, in groups of vaccinated animals, provided a correlation with the capacity to control virus replication after subsequent challenge. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The feasibility of using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) as a diagnostic tool for detection of FMDV in milk was assessed by studying the excretion of virus from experimentally-infected cattle. Fore- and machine milk samples were collected over a 4-week period from two dairy cows infected with FMDV and from two in-contact cows held in the same pen. The whole, skim, cream and cellular debris components of the milks were tested by automated rRT-PCR and results compared to virus isolation (VI) in cell culture. The onset of clinical signs of FMD in all four cows correlated with viraemia, and the presence of FMDV in other clinical samples. rRT-PCR results matched closely with VI in detecting FMDV in all milk components and generally coincided with, but did not consistently precede, the onset of clinical signs. rRT-PCR detected FMDV in milk up to 23 days post inoculation which was longer than VI. Furthermore, the detection limit of FMDV in milk was greater by rRT-PCR than VI and, in contrast to VI, rRT-PCR detected virus genome following heat treatment that simulated pasteurisation. rRT-PCR was also able to detect FMDV in preservative-treated milk. In conclusion, this study showed that automated rRT-PCR is quicker and more sensitive than VI and can be used to detect FMDV in whole milk as well as milk fractions from infected animals. © INRA, EDP Sciences, 2005.",2006

Apoptosis can also occur in some virus-infected cells, and ability of viruses to either inhibit or promote apoptosis may influence the pathologic outcome of infection. In this study, to determine if apoptosis plays a role in the outcome of FMDV infection in swine, we evaluated apoptosis in diseased tissues collected from pigs inoculated with two different stains of FMDV (O1 Campos and O Taiwan). And host cell DNA fragmentation in diseased tissue from animals which were infected with either virus was evaluated by occurrence of a laddering pattern characteristic of apoptosis. Infection of cultured keratinocytes from swine tongue failed to demonstrate apoptosis in the first few hours of infection, suggesting that cell-to-cell correlation between viral antigen and apoptotic changes, e.g. cytokine secretions by immune system cells, could be critical to initiating apoptosis. Consistent with this finding, we were able to detect the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α in diseased tissues. A clear difference in the pathogenicity of the two different FMDV isolates to pigs was not demonstrated in our study.",2005

Twenty FMDV vaccinated and five unvaccinated cattle were challenged by direct contact with five donor cattle excreting FMDV and monitored until 28 days post challenge-exposure [1]. Twelve vaccinated and three unvaccinated animals were retained up to 24 weeks post exposure to FMDV in order to monitor viral persistence, transmission and antibody responses. In nine vaccinated animals, infection persisted beyond 28 days post exposure, virus being detected more frequently and for longer in oesophagopharyngeal samples from these animals when examined by RT-PCR rather than by virus isolation. Although recovery of FMDV RNA became increasingly sporadic over time, the number of RNA copies detected in positive samples declined only slowly. Two naïve sentinel cattle housed with the persistently infected animals between 93 and 168 days after the latter had been challenge-exposed to FMDV did not become infected. There were differences in the ability of commercially available serological tests to detect antibodies to FMDV non-structural proteins (NSP) in vaccinated and subsequently challenged cattle. Although no single test could identify all of the vaccinated cattle that became persistently infected, the most poorly recognised animals were those with the least evidence of virus replication based on other tests.

Since no quantitative data were available on the effectiveness of vaccination in cattle, we investigated whether a single vaccination against FMD could reduce virus transmission in groups of calves by estimating the reproduction ratio R, i.e. the average number of secondary cases caused by one infectious animal in a susceptible population. We performed two experiments with six groups of either four vaccinated or four non-vaccinated calves each. Vaccination was carried out with O1 Manisa vaccine. Two weeks after vaccination, two calves per group were inoculated intra-nasally with FMDV field isolate O/NET2001. The two other calves were contact-exposed to the inoculated calves. Contact infections were observed by clinical inspection, virus isolation and RT-PCR on heparinised blood, oro-pharyngeal fluid and probang samples and antibody response to non-structural proteins. In all six non-vaccinated groups, transmission to contact-exposed calves was recorded; in the vaccinated groups, virus transmission was observed to one contact-exposed calf. In the non-vaccinated groups Rc was 2.52 and significantly above 1, whereas in the vaccinated groups Rv = 0.18 and significantly below 1, indicating that vaccination may successfully be applied as additional intervention tool to reduce virus transmission in a future epidemic of FMD. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

An oil adjuvant O 1 Manisa FMD vaccine protected 20 cattle from clinical disease following 5 days of direct-contact exposure to five infected cattle at 21 days post vaccination. The donor cattle had been infected by tongue inoculation with a different FMD virus of the same serotype (O UKG 2001). Protection from clinical disease did not prevent localised sub-clinical infection at the oropharynx in most animals, although quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the level of virus replication shortly after direct-contact challenge was greatly reduced in vaccinated animals. Nevertheless, 45% of the vaccinated cattle became persistently infected with 10 3-10 6 RNA copies per millilitre of oropharyngeal fluid at 28 days post challenge. However, since live virus could not be readily isolated, the risk of these animals transmitting disease was probably very low. The findings show that even after an extremely severe challenge, use of an emergency vaccine will prevent or reduce local virus replication and thereby dramatically reduce the amount of virus released into the environment in the all-important early post-exposure period. These data should help to model the dynamics of virus transmission in future outbreaks of disease where vaccination is considered. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",2005

It is caused by a capripoxvirus that belongs to the family Poxviridae. The disease is of economic importance in endemic areas. Effective control of LSD requires accurate and rapid laboratory techniques to confirm a tentative clinical diagnosis. Comparative studies on different diagnostic tests used at different stages of the disease have not been done. The aim of this study was to compare several of these tests. Six seronegative bulls, between 11 and 20 months of age, were infected intravenously and kept in an insect-free facility. The course of the infection was monitored. During a 3-month period blood samples and skin biopsies were collected for virus isolation and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Skin biopsies were also examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The incubation period in infected animals varied from 4-5 days. The length of the viraemic period did not correlate with the severity of clinical disease. Viraemia was detected from 1-12 days using virus isolation and from 4-11 days using the PCR, which is longer than has previously been reported. Virus was isolated from skin biopsies until Day 39 post infection (p.i.) and PCR could demonstrate viral DNA until Day 92 p.i. Transmission electron microscopy of negatively stained skin biopsies detected LSD virus only in one of the four bulls that developed skin lesions until Day 33 p.i. The PCR was a fast and sensitive method to demonstrate viral DNA in blood and skin samples. It could detect viral nucleic acid in skin lesions 53 days longer than virus isolation. Virus isolation from blood and skin samples was sensitive and reliable, but as a single test it may be too time-consuming to use although this depends on how rapidly the diagnosis must be confirmed. In conclusion, this study showed the PCR to be superior in detecting LSD virus from blood and skin samples. However, virus isolation is still required when the infectivity of the LSD virus is to be determined.",2005

To determine transmission to a sensitive animal, we put a sentinel calf among the infected cattle from 60 days post-infection until the end of the experiment at 609 days post-infection. Samples were tested for the presence of FMDV, viral genome, specific IgA antibodies, antibodies against FMDV non-structural (NS) proteins or neutralising antibodies. Virus and viral genome was intermittently isolated from probang samples and the number of isolations decreased over time. During the first 100 days significantly more samples were positive by RT-PCR than by virus isolation (VI), whereas, late after infection more samples were positive by virus isolation. All the inoculated cattle developed high titres of neutralising antibodies that remained high during the entire experiment. An IgA antibody response was intermittently detected in the oropharyngeal fluid of 14 of the 17 calves, while all of them developed detectable levels of antibodies to NS proteins of FMDV in serum, which declined slowly beyond 34 days post-infection. Nevertheless, at 609 days after inoculation, 10 cattle (60%) were still positive by NS ELISA. Of the 17 cattle in our experiment, 16 became carriers. Despite frequent reallocation between a different pair of infected cattle no transmission to the sentinel calf occurred. It remained negative in all assays during the entire experiment.

Each ReTi-PCR test was validated for specificity, analytical sensitivity (detection limits), and experimental infection studies were performed to compare the conventional virus isolation methods with the newly developed ReTi-PCR tests. All five developed ReTi-PCR tests are very rapid compared to virus isolation, highly specific, and even more sensitive (lower detection limits) than conventional virus isolation methods for the detection of mentioned viruses in semen. In semen of experimentally infected boars, viruses were detected much earlier after infection and more frequently by ReTi-PCR tests than by virus isolations. The high throughput of these rapid ReTi-PCR tests makes it possible to screen large number of semen samples for the presence of viruses prior to insemination. This is a substantial advantage, in particular for boar semen the quality of which deteriorates quickly after storage.

Virological and serological results confirmed that there had been no local virus replication in the oropharynx of sheep from the high potency vaccine group in contrast to moderate or substantial virus replication in the oropharynx of the low potency vaccinated or unvaccinated sheep respectively. The vaccines showed no evidence of promoting a local mucosal antibody response at the time of virus challenge, but were capable of stimulating a systemic gamma interferon response, the level of which was related to the antigen payload. This suggests that the systemic gamma interferon response could be a useful indicator of the ability of a FMD vaccine to elicit a sterile immunity and indicates that further work is warranted to investigate the role of systemic gamma interferon in this immunity. This is the first experiment to clearly show that high potency, high payload, FMD vaccines are capable of inhibiting local virus replication and consequently persistence and the carrier state in this target species. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Viral RNA was detected within 24 h post-infection (p.i.) in all infected animals. Rapid virus replication led to peak levels of viral RNA load by 30-53 h p.i., and then the load declined at various rates. In some animals (n = 12, so-called non-carriers) viral RNA became undetectable between 7 and 18 days p.i. In contrast, in persistently infected animals (n = 12, so-called carriers) viral RNA persisted in OP-fluid samples at detectable levels beyond 28 days p.i. Analysis of early viral decay/clearance and virus clearance half-life in OP-fluid samples showed that the extent of reduction of viral RNA in OP-fluid samples immediately following peak levels is a critical determinant of the outcome of FMDV persistence. © 2004 SGM.",2004

No foot-and-mouth disease virus transmission between individually housed calves Veterinary Microbiology, 98(1),  29","Bouma, A., Dekker, A., De Jong, M.C.M.","No foot-and-mouth disease virus transmission between individually housed calves","The foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in The Netherlands in 2001 most likely started on a mixed veal-calf/dairy-goat farm. The outbreak among the 74 calves on this farm appeared to be limited to four animals, and no clinical signs of FMD were reported. Also on a second veal-calf farm minor clinical signs and limited virus transmission were observed. Since FMD is known to be a very contagious disease, and can cause severe lesions, these observations were disputed. Therefore, we carried out two experiments to determine whether the Dutch FMD virus isolate from 2001 does spread among individually housed calves with limited contacts, either indirect (experiment 1) or direct (experiment 2). In experiment 1, four pairs of calves were housed in an individual box at 1m distance from each other. In experiment 2, two groups of three calves were housed in individual boxes, directly bordering each other. We infected one animal per pair in experiment 1, and the calf in the middle in experiment 2. We recorded clinical signs, virus shedding in saliva and the development of antibodies. In addition, we determined whether the virus was transmitted from the inoculated calves to the neighbour(s). All inoculated calves showed mild signs of FMD - fever, and some vesicles on hoofs and/or in the mouth - but only one calf showed signs that were visible without physical examination. All inoculated calves shed virus in the saliva and developed neutralising antibodies. None of the contact animals seroconverted, indicating that virus transmission did not occur. These experiments showed that no virus transmission among individual housed calves can occur. This finding supports the hypothesis of the route of virus introduction to The Netherlands in 2001 and show that the observations on the two veal-calf farms were not impossible. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Pigs were inoculated by the intravenous or intradermal/subcutaneous route with FMDV and housed together in groups or individually. The effects of dose, inoculation route and exposure intensity on the replication of FMDV in vivo and the development of disease were studied. It was shown that the higher the dose, the shorter was the time to the start of active viraemia and to the onset of clinical signs. Exposure intensity and housing conditions influenced the viral dynamics of FMDV. Increasing the exposure intensity, by increasing the number of infected pigs housed together, had the effect of synchronizing the infection and reducing the variance in the start of active viraemia. Increasing the number of pigs housed together also increased the interaction between the pigs and the activity of individual pigs, which had the effect of shortening the time to the onset of clinical signs such as vesicle formation. Intradermal inoculation was more effective than intravenous inoculation for transmitting FMDV to pigs, resulting in shorter times to the start of active viraemia and in higher clinical scores. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12 were consistently detected in challenged animals that had been vaccinated. Other cytokines - IL-1, IL-2, TNF, TGF and interferons - were not detected. This demonstrates that the vaccine did not induce a systemic inflammatory response, nor a systemic elevation of T lymphocyte activity. Although the IL-6 and IL-8 did not relate to protection, IL-12 production was highest in the protected vaccinated pigs. Thus, the induction of monocytic cell activity, demonstrable by the production of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-12, appears to play a critical role in FMDV emergency vaccine induction of the innate immune defences which relate to early protection against FMD.

Five separate transmission experiments were performed, with different doses of FMD virus, each experiment containing five intranasally inoculated donor sheep and 10 in-contact recipient sheep. The lowest dose required to cause clinical infection by inoculation (104 50% tissue culture infectious doses; 104 TCID50) was also the optimum dose for producing in-contact transmission. Inoculation of donor sheep with higher doses (105 and 106 TCID50) resulted in reduced transmission, characterized by reduced duration and degree of viraemia and an early humoral and cell-mediated immune response.

The objective of the present study was to examine the early pathogenesis of FMD in pigs by a quantitative time-course study. Under experimental conditions, recipient pigs were infected by contact with donor pigs affected by FMD. Every 24 h from day 1 to day 4 after exposure, two recipient pigs were selected randomly, killed and necropsied. A range of tissues were analysed by a quantitative TaqMan RT-PCR method and by titration of FMD virus on primary bovine thyroid cells. The titres of virus determined by assay in cell culture and calculated from the quantitative TaqMan data correlated strongly (r > 0.9), thereby establishing the validity of the TaqMan calculations. The data indicated that the replication of virus in the lungs contributes only in small part to airborne virus excretion. Sites in the pharynx, trachea and nasal mucosa are probably more important in that regard. The sites of earliest virus infection and possibly replication in recipient pigs appeared to be in the pharynx (soft palate, tonsil and floor of pharynx). The data indicated that FMD virus replication in pigs is rapid and that the majority of virus amplification occurs in the skin. A model for the progression of infection is proposed, indicating initial spread from the pharyngeal region, through regional lymph nodes and via the blood to epithelial cells, resulting in several cycles of virus amplification and spread.",2001

This has important consequences for FMD control during both prophylactic vaccination programmes in endemic situations and when emergency vaccination may be used as an adjunct to stamping out during outbreaks in countries normally free from the disease. The rapid and effective control of FMD in pigs is especially important in regions of high pig density since infected pigs have the potential to generate plumes of airborne virus and spread infection beyond the immediate control area. Increased knowledge of the kinetics of FMDV replication in pigs, especially in their respiratory tracts, could create opportunities for strategies to improve FMD vaccines for pigs. A fluorogenic TaqMan RT-PCR assay specific for the IRES (internal ribosome entry site) sequence of the O1 Kaufbeuren/Lausanne strain of FMDV has been developed for this purpose. The assay had a sensitivity of 0.1 TCID50/ml, and a dynamic range of at least eight orders of magnitude. It was found that an established method of quantitation, relative to a housekeeping gene, exhibited two significant shortcomings when applied to a set of 16 anatomically highly diverse solid tissues: (i) tissue differences in housekeeping gene expression caused errors of up to 60-fold in estimated FMDV concentrations; and (ii) variability in total RNA yields caused unpredictable saturation of RT reactions, which in turn caused errors of up to 250-fold in the estimated FMDV concentration. A novel quantitation strategy, designated the Ct/min method, was developed to overcome these problems. The Ct/min method was based on the the RT-PCR examination of a dilution series of spectrophotometrically quantitated total RNA, spanning the optimum for the RT-PCR system used. The new method was influenced minimally by any tissue-specific RT-PCR inhibitors and was used to determine FMDV concentrations in tissues from four experimentally infected pigs. The results suggest that the lungs play a less important role in the replication of FMDV in pigs than was thought previously. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",2001

Design - Cattle with experimentally induced persistent FMDV infections were slaughtered at 750 days after viral exposure. Experimentally infected pigs were slaughtered at 28 days after FMDV inoculation. Postmortem specimens were asceptically removed. Animals - Three bovids and 3 pigs were studied, as well as 1 control animal for each species. Procedure - Various tissues were examined for the presence of FMDV-specific sequences by dot-blot hybridization assay, using a molecularly cloned FMDV cDNA corresponding to the polymerase coding region. Results - The FMDV-specific genomic sequences were only detected in RNA from spleen, lung, larynx, tonsils, pancreas, liver, esophagus, and WBC of bovids. Conclusions - It was established that, at late stages of the persistent infection, when virus isolation was not possible, cattle may carry FMDV-specific sequences in different tissues. Retention of viral sequences could not be demonstrated in specimens from experimentally infected swine, 28 days after viral inoculation.",1996

Of 30 llamas directly exposed to the FMD virus, only three (3/30) showed evidence of infection, and of those, only two (2/30) had mild clinical signs. No FMD virus was isolated from either oesophageal‐pharyngeal (OP) fluid or blood samples collected from the infected llamas beyond 14 days post‐exposure. There was no evidence of virus transmission between the directly exposed and indirectly exposed llamas or between both groups of llamas and susceptible domestic livestock, as determined by the lack of clinical signs, by virus isolation, and by serology results.

Comparisons of RNase T1 two-dimensional maps and nucleotide sequences of the VP1-coding region revealed a continual, although irregular, increase in the fixation of mutations as the infection progressed. Most changes were not conserved in consecutive isolates. These results, together with the substantial rates of genomic variation observed between some pairs of strains recovered at close time periods, suggested the coexistence of heterogeneous populations in which variants evolve independently from each other, and predominate at irregular time intervals. Furthermore, non-related patterns of variation were observed in the four animals. Similarly, genetic diversity of representative strains from major serotype O outbreaks in endemic disease regions of southeastern Brazil and central eastern Argentina which occurred between 1958 and 1983, suggested that outbreak strains are also likely to represent fluctuations of heterogeneous populations which evolve independently from each other.

The virus is endemic to Africa and the Arabian Peninsula where outbreaks are characterized by abortion storms and mortality of newborns, particularly in sheep herds. Vector competence experiments in laboratory settings have suggested that over 50 mosquito species are capable of transmitting RVFV. Transmission of mosquito-borne viruses in the field is however influenced by numerous factors, including population densities, blood feeding behavior, extrinsic incubation period, longevity of vectors, and viremia levels in vertebrate hosts. Animal models to study these important aspects of RVFV transmission are currently lacking. In the present work, RVFV was transmitted to European (Texel-swifter cross-breed) lambs by laboratory-reared Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that were infected either by membrane feeding on a virus-spiked blood meal or by feeding on lambs that developed viremia after intravenous inoculation of RVFV. Feeding of mosquitoes on viremic lambs resulted in strikingly higher infection rates as compared to membrane feeding. Subsequent transmission of RVFV from lamb to lamb by infected mosquitoes was highly efficient in both models. The animal models described here can be used to study mosquito-mediated transmission of RVFV among the major natural target species and to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines against mosquito-mediated RVFV infection. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021

Outbreaks of genotype VII NDV and IBDV variants in vaccinated poultry flocks call for genetically matched vaccines. In the present study, a genetic matched chimeric NDV LaSota vaccine strain expressing VP2 gene of IBDV variant, rLaS-VIIF/HN-VP2 was generated for the first time, in which both the F and HN genes of LaSota were replaced with those of the genotype VII NDV strain FJSW. The cleavage site of the FJSW strain F protein in the rLaS-VIIF/HN-VP2 genome was mutated to the avirulent motif found in LaSota. Expression of IBDV VP2 protein was confirmed by western blot. The rLaS-VIIF/HN-VP2 maintained the efficient replication ability in embryonated eggs, low pathogenicity and genetic stability comparable to that of parental LaSota virus. One dose oculonasal vaccination of one-week-old SPF chickens with rLaS-VIIF/HN-VP2 induced full protection against genotype VII NDV and IBDV lethal challenge. These results indicate that the rLaS-VIIF/HN-VP2 is a promising bivalent vaccine to prevent infections of IBDV and genotype VII NDV. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2021

There is scarce information concerning the pathogenicity and genetic characteristics of the circulating velogenic Newcastle disease virus (NDV) in Egypt. In the present work, NDV was screened from tracheal swabs collected from several broiler chicken farms (N = 12) in Dakahlia Governorate, Egypt. Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) was used for screening of velogenic and mesogenic NDV strains through targeting F gene fragment amplification, followed by sequencing of the resulting PCR products. The identified strain, namely, NDV-CH-EGYPT-F42DAKAHLIA-2019, was isolated and titrated in the allantoic cavity of 10 day old specific pathogen-free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs), and then their virulence was determined by mean death time (MDT) and intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI). The pathogenicity of the identified velogenic NDV strain was also assessed in 28 day old chickens using different inoculation routes as follows: intraocular, choanal slit, intranasal routes, and a combination of both intranasal and intraocular routes. In addition, sera were collected 5 and 10 days post inoculation (pi) for the detection of NDV antibodies by hemagglutination inhibition test (HI), and tissue samples from different organs were collected for histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. A series of different clinical signs and postmortem lesions were recorded with the various routes. Interestingly, histopathology and immunohistochemistry for NDV nucleoprotein displayed widespread systemic distribution. The intensity of viral nucleoprotein immunolabeling was detected within different cells including the epithelial and endothelium lining, as well as macrophages. The onset, distribution, and severity of the observed lesions were remarkably different between various inoculation routes. Collectively, a time-course comparative pathogenesis study of NDV infection demonstrated the role of different routes in the pathogenicity of NDV. The intranasal challenge was associated with a prominent increase in NDV lesions, whereas the choanal slit route was the route least accompanied by severe NDV pathological findings. Clearly, the present findings might be helpful for implementation of proper vaccination strategies against NDV. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2021

The recent PPR outbreaks in Northern Africa, the European part of Turkey, and Bulgaria represent a significant threat to mainland Europe, as a source of disease. Although two safe and efficacious live attenuated vaccines (Sungri/96 and Nigeria/75/1) are available for the control of PPR, current serological tests do not enable the differentiation between naturally infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA). The vaccinated animals develop a full range of immune responses to viral proteins and, therefore, cannot be distinguished serologically from those that have recovered from a natural infection. This poses a serious problem for the post-vaccinal sero-surveillance during the ongoing PPR eradication program. Furthermore, during the latter stages of any eradication program, vaccination is only possible if the vaccine used is fully DIVA compliant. Using reverse genetics, we have developed two live attenuated PPR DIVA vaccines (Sungri/96 DIVA and Nigeria/75/1 DIVA), in which the C-terminal variable region of the PPRV N-protein has been replaced with dolphin morbillivirus (DMV). As a proof of principle, both the DIVA vaccines were evaluated in goats in pilot studies for safety and efficacy, and all the animals were clinically protected against the intranasal virulent virus challenge, similar to the parent vaccines. Furthermore, it is possible to differentiate between infected animals and vaccinated animals using two newly developed ELISAs. Therefore, these DIVA vaccines and associated tests can facilitate the sero-monitoring process and speed up the implementation of global PPR eradication through vaccination. © 2021 by the authors.

Despite intensive efforts with current vaccination programs, this disease still occurs worldwide, causing significant mortality even in vaccinated flocks. This has been partially attributed to a gap in immunity during the post-hatch period due to the presence of maternal antibodies that negatively impact the replication of the commonly used live vaccines. In ovo vaccines have multiple advantages and present an opportunity to address this problem. Currently employed in ovo ND vaccines are recombinant herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT)-vectored vaccines expressing Newcastle disease virus (NDV) antigens. Although proven efficient, these vaccines have some limitations, such as delayed immunogenicity and the inability to administer a second HVT vaccine post-hatch. The use of live ND vaccines for in ovo vaccination is currently not applicable, as these are associated with high embryo mortality. In this study, recombinant NDV-vectored experimental vaccines containing an antisense sequence of avian interleukin 4 (IL4R) and their backbones were administered in ovo at different doses in 18-day-old commercial eggs possessing high maternal antibodies titers. The hatched birds were challenged with virulent NDV at 2 weeks-of-age. Post-hatch vaccine shedding, post-challenge survival, challenge virus shedding, and humoral immune responses were evaluated at multiple timepoints. Recombinant NDV (rNDV) vaccinated birds had significantly reduced post-hatch mortality compared with the wild-type LaSota vaccine. All rNDV vaccines were able to penetrate maternal immunity and induce a strong early humoral immune response. Further, the rNDV vaccines provided protection from clinical disease and significantly decreased virus shedding after early virulent NDV challenge at two weeks post-hatch. The post-challenge hemagglutination-inhibition antibody titers in the vaccinated groups remained comparable with the pre-challenge titers, suggesting the capacity of the studied vaccines to prevent efficient replication of the challenge virus. Post-hatch survival after vaccination with the rNDV-IL4R vaccines was dose-dependent, with an increase in survival as the dose decreased. This improved survival and the dose-dependency data suggest that novel attenuated in ovo rNDV-based vaccines that are able to penetrate maternal immunity to elicit a strong immune response as early as 14 days post-hatch, resulting in high or full protection from virulent challenge, show promise as a contributor to the control of Newcastle disease. © 2021 by the authors.

The immunogenic genes of CIAV were expressed as a single transcriptional unit from the NDV backbone and the two CIA viral proteins were obtained as separate entities using a self-cleaving foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A protease sequence between them. The recombinant virus (rR2B-FPCS-CAV) had similar growth kinetics as that of the parent recombinant virus (rR2B-FPCS) in vitro with similar pathogenicity characteristics. The bivalent vaccine candidate when given in specific pathogen-free chickens as primary and booster doses was able to elicit robust humoral and cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses obtained in a vaccination study that was conducted over a pe-riod of 15 weeks. In an NDV and CIAV ELISA trial, there was a significant difference in the titres of antibody between vaccinated and control groups which showed slight reduction in antibody titre by 56 days of age. Hence, a second booster was administered and the antibody titres were main-tained until 84 days of age. Similar trends were noticed in CMI response carried out by lymphocyte transformation test, CD4+ and CD8+ response by flow cytometry analysis and response of real time PCR analysis of cytokine genes. Birds were challenged with virulent NDV and CIAV at 84 days and there was significant reduction in the NDV shed on the 2nd and 4th days post challenge in vaccinated birds as compared to unvaccinated controls. Haematological parameters comprising PCV, TLC, PLC and PHC were estimated in birds that were challenged with CIAV that indicated a significant reduction in the blood parameters of controls.

Unfortunately, in ovo live vaccines against Newcastle disease have significant limitations, including high embryo mortality and the inability to induce full protection during the first two weeks of life. In this study, a recombinant live attenuated Newcastle disease virus vaccine containing the antisense sequence of chicken interleukin 4 (IL-4), rZJ1*L-IL4R, was used. The rZJ1*L-IL4R vaccine was administered in ovo to naïve specific pathogen free embryonated chicken eggs (ECEs) and evaluated against a homologous challenge. Controls included a live attenuated recombinant genotype VII vaccine based on the virus ZJ1 (rZJ1*L) backbone, the LaSota vaccine and diluent alone. In the first of two experiments, ECEs were vaccinated at 18 days of embryonation (DOE) with either 104.5 or 103.5 50% embryo infectious dose (EID50/egg) and chickens were challenged at 21 days post-hatch (DPH). In the second experiment, 103.5 EID50/egg of each vaccine was administered at 19 DOE, and chickens were challenged at 14 DPH. Chickens vaccinated with 103.5 EID50/egg of rZJ1*L-IL4R had hatch rates comparable to the group that received diluent alone, whereas other groups had significantly lower hatch rates. All vaccinated chickens survived challenge without displaying clinical disease, had protective hemagglutination inhibition titers, and shed comparable levels of challenge virus. The recombinant rZJ1*L-IL4R vaccine yielded lower post-vaccination mortality rates compared with the other in ovo NDV live vaccine candidates as well as provided strong protection post-challenge. © 2021 by the authors.

It has a worldwide distribution and a continuous diversity of genotypes. Despite its limited zoonotic potential, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) outbreaks in Egypt occur frequently and result in serious economic losses in the poultry industry. In this study, we investigated and charac-terized NDV in wild cattle egrets and house sparrows. Fifty cattle egrets and fifty house sparrows were collected from the vicinity of chicken farms in Kafrelsheikh Governorate, Egypt, which has a history of NDV infection. Lung, spleen, and brain tissue samples were pooled from each bird and screened for NDV by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to amplify the 370 bp NDV F gene frag-ment. NDV was detected by RRT-PCR in 22 of 50 (44%) cattle egrets and 13 of 50 (26%) house spar-rows, while the conventional RT-PCR detected NDV in 18 of 50 (36%) cattle egrets and 10 of 50 (20%) of house sparrows. Phylogenic analysis revealed that the NDV strains identified in the present study are closely related to other Egyptian class II, sub-genotype VII.1.1 NDV strains from GenBank, hav-ing 99.7%–98.5% identity. The pathogenicity of the wild-bird-origin NDV sub-genotype VII.1.1 NDV strains were assessed by experimental inoculation of identified strains (KFS-Motobas-2, KFS-Elhamoul-1, and KFS-Elhamoul-3) in 28-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF) Cobb chickens. The clinical signs and post-mortem changes of velogenic NDV genotype VII (GVII) were observed in inoculated chickens 3 to 7 days post-inoculation, with 67.5%–70% mortality rates. NDV was detected in all NDV-inoculated chickens by RRT-PCR and RT-PCR at 3, 7, and 10 days post-inoculation. The histopathological findings of the experimentally infected chickens showed marked pulmonary con-gestion and pneumonia associated with complete bronchial stenosis. The spleen showed histocytic cell proliferation with marked lymphoid depletion, while the brain had malacia and diffuse gliosis. These findings provide interesting data about the characterization of NDV in wild birds from Egypt and add to our understanding of their possible role in the transmission dynamics of the disease in Egypt. Further research is needed to explore the role of other species of wild birds in the epidemiology of this disease and to compare the strains circulating in wild birds with those found in poultry. © 2021 by the authors.

The virus titers in oral/cloacal swabs of each LPAIV pre-inoculation group were significantly lower at 3–5 days post-HPAIV inoculation. Notably, almosno virus was detected in swabs from surviving individuals of the LBM678 pre-inoculation group. Antigenic cross-reactivity among the viruses was not observed in the neutralization test. These results suggest that pre-infection with LPAIV attenuates the pathogenicity of HPAIV in domestic ducks, which might be explained by innate and/or cell-mediated immunity induced by the initial infection with LPAIV. © 2021 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.",2021

This study was performed to evaluate the pathological lesions of Newcastle disease virus (NDV) genotype VIId in different organs of commercial layer chickens (ND antibodies-free). Therefore, forty, 1-day-old chicks were divided into 2 equal groups with 20 birds each. Group 1 served as the non-infected (negative control) group, while group 2 was infected at 28 days old by intranasal inoculation of 0.2 ml containing 106 EID50 of NDV genotype VII.Tissue samples from trachea, lung, spleen and liver were collected from dead infected chickens at 4 days post-infection(dpi) and 6 dpi for detection of NDV RNA by real time Polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Tissue sections from lung, trachea, spleen, liver and proventriculus from the infected group and non-infected group were collected for histopathology at 5 dpi. The clinical signs in infected group appeared at 3 dpi and lasted for the 6th dpi represented by obvious greenish droppings at 5th dpi, leg paralysis and torticollis at the 4th and 5th dpi. Mortality was 10, 6 and 3 birds at 4 dpi, 5 dpi and 6 dpi respectively in infected group with total mortality rate 95%. Grossly, enlarged mottled spleen, severe hemorrhages on the tips of periventricular glands, severe muscle congestion, hemorrhagic ulcers on cecal tonsils and severe congestion with hemorrhages on the thymus gland at 4th and 5th dpi. Detection of NDV nucleic acid by rRT-PCR revealed highest detection rate (80% and 100%) in respiratory tissues (pooled trachea and lung), moderate detection rate (60% and 66.7%) in spleen and lowest detection rate (30% and 33.3%) in liver at 4 dpi and 6 dpi respectively. Histopathological investigation of different organs revealed pneumonia, tracheitis, spleenitis with lymphoid depletion, hepatitis and moderate proventriculitis. We conclude that our velogenic Newcastle disease virus(vNDV) strain is viscerotropic neurotropic pathotype exhibited high morbidity and mortality rates (95%) associated with immunosuppression in infected layer chickens. Detection of NDV RNA by rRT-PCR in our infected chicken organs emphasizing tissue tropism and distribution of vNDV in different organs, also suggesting the use of rRT-PCR in detection of NDV infected organs. further periodical investigations are needed to evaluate vNDV pathogenesis in chickens with considering the virus distribution pattern in different tissues. © 2021 Fawzy et al.

Immunity provided by a ND vaccine can be characterized by measuring the level of clinical protection and reduction in challenge virus shedding. The extent of shedding depends a lot on the characteristics of vaccine used and the quality of vaccination, but influenced also by the genotype of the challenge virus. We demonstrated that vaccination of SPF chicks with recombinant herpesvirus of turkey expressing the F-gene of genotype I ND virus (rHVT-ND) provided complete clinical protection against heterologous genotype VII.1.1 ND virus strain and reduced challenge virus shedding significantly. 100% of clinical protection was achieved already by 3 weeks of age, irrespective of the challenge route (intra-muscular or intra-nasal) and vaccination blocked cloacal shedding almost completely. Interestingly, oro-nasal shedding was different in the two challenge routes: less efficiently controlled following intra-nasal than intra-muscular challenge. Differences in the shedding pattern between the two challenge routes indicate that rHVT-ND vaccine induces strong systemic immunity, that is capable to control challenge virus dissemination in the body (no cloacal shedding), even when it is a heterologous strain, but less efficiently, although highly significantly (p < 0.001) suppresses the local replication of the challenge virus in the upper respiratory mucosa and consequent oro-nasal shedding. © 2021 by the authors.

Objectives: We aimed at deciphering the sequential tissue tropism, pathological events and putative role of M2c macrophages during incubatory, prodromal and invasive stages of PPRV infection. Methodology: A total of 10 goats were sequentially sacrificed at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days post-infection (dpi, n = 2 per time-point) following intranasal inoculation with a highly virulent strain of PPRV (lineage IV PPRV/Izatnagar/94). Histological evaluation to assess PPRV mediated pathologies, RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) to decipher sequential virus distribution, and dual immunolabelling to determine the role of M2c macrophage in early PPRV uptake and transmission was performed. Results: PPRV/Izatnagar/94 caused major pathologies in the lung tissues. Unprecedentedly, PPRV nucleic acid and antigens were detected in various tissues as early as one dpi. RT-qPCR revealed PPRV in the nasal cavity, trachea, bronchi, tongue and lymph nodes draining these tissues from 1 dpi. IHC affirms cells residing in the lamina propria and submucosa of the respiratory tract and tongue and peribronchiolar areas of lungs as the primary target of PPRV. Following initial replication in the respiratory tract, PPRV is transmitted to the regional lymph nodes where primary viral amplification occurs. After viraemia and secondary replication in generalized lymphoid tissues, PPRV infects and replicates in the epithelial cells. Further, we localized CD163+ M2c macrophages in the goat tissues, but dual IHC elucidated that M2c macrophages do not facilitate uptake and transmission of PPRV during the early stages of infection. Conclusion: Our study substantiates the disease establishment process and pathogenesis of PPRV/Izatnagar/94 during the incubatory and prodromal stages of infection. Further, we have also observed M2c macrophage distribution in the goat tissues and demonstrated that they do not pick and transmit PPRV. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021

Capripoxviruses cause serious disease to livestock and contribute to huge economic losses. Goatpox and sheeppox are endemic to Africa, particularly north of the Equator, the Middle East and many parts of Asia. GTPV and sheeppox virus are considered host-specific; however, both strains can cause clinical disease in either goats or sheep with more severe disease in the homologous species and mild or sub-clinical infection in the other. Goatpox has never been reported in Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia despite the huge population of goats living in proximity with sheep in those countries. To evaluate the susceptibility and pathogenicity of indigenous North African goats to GTPV infection, we experimentally inoculated eight locally bred goats with a virulent Vietnamese isolate of GTPV. Two uninfected goats were kept as controls. Clinical examination was carried out daily and blood was sampled for virology and for investigating the antibody response. After necropsy, tissues were collected and assessed for viral DNA using real-time PCR. Results: Following the experimental infection, all inoculated goats displayed clinical signs characteristic of goatpox including varying degrees of hyperthermia, loss of appetite, inactivity and cutaneous lesions. The infection severely affected three of the infected animals while moderate to mild disease was noticed in the remaining goats. A high antibody response was developed. High viral DNA loads were detected in skin crusts and nodules, and subcutaneous tissue at the injection site with cycle threshold (Ct) values ranging from 14.6 to 22.9, while lower viral loads were found in liver and lung (Ct = 35.7 and 35.1). The results confirmed subcutaneous tropism of the virus. Conclusion: Clinical signs of goatpox were reproduced in indigenous North African goats and confirmed a high susceptibility of the North African goat breed to GTPV infection. A clinical scoring system is proposed that can be applied in GTPV vaccine efficacy studies. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021

Besides stamping out policy for eradication, immunization with vaccines of live attenuated CSF or the CSF-E2 subunit is an efficacious measure of disease control. However, after decades of efforts, it is still hard to eliminate CSF from endemically affected regions and reemerging areas. Most of previous studies demonstrated the efficacy of different CSF vaccines in laboratories under high containment conditions, which may not represent the practical performance in field farms. The inadequate vaccine efficacy induced by unrestrained factors may lead to chronic or persistent CSF infection in animals that develop a major source for virus shedding among pig populations. In this study, a vaccination-challenge-cohabitation trial on specific-pathogen-free (SPF) pigs and long-term monitoring of conventional sows and their offspring were used to evaluate the efficacy and the impact of maternally derived antibody (MDA) interference on CSF vaccines in farm applications. Results: The trials demonstrated higher neutralizing antibody (NA) titers with no clinical symptoms and significant pathological changes in the CSF-E2 subunit vaccine immunized group after CSFV challenge. Additionally, none of the sentinel pigs were infected during cohabitation indicating that the CSF-E2 subunit vaccine could provoke adequately acquired immunity to prevent horizontal transmission. In field farm applications, sows immunized with CSF-E2 subunit vaccine revealed an average of higher and consistent antibody level with significant reduction of CSF viral RNA detection via saliva monitoring in contrast to those of live attenuated CSF vaccine immunized sows possessing diverse antibody titer distributions and higher viral loads. Furthermore, early application of the CSF-E2 subunit vaccine in 3-week-old piglets illustrated no MDA interference on primary immunization and could elicit consistent and long-lasting adequate antibody response suggesting the flexibility of CSF-E2 subunit vaccine on vaccination program determination. Conclusions: The CSF-E2 subunit vaccine demonstrated significant efficacy and no MDA interference for immunization in both pregnant sows and piglets. These advantages provide a novel approach to avoid possible virus shedding in sow population and MDA interference in piglets for control of CSF in field farm applications. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021

Current PPRV control strategies rely on live-attenuated vaccines, which are not ideal, as they cannot differentiate infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). Recombinant vector-based vaccines expressing viral subunits can provide an alternative to conventional vaccines, as they can be easily paired with DIVA diagnostic tools. In the present work, we used the bovine herpesvirus-4-based vector (BoHV-4-A) to deliver PPRV hemagglutinin H antigen (BoHV-4-A-PPRV-H-ΔTK). Vaccination with BoHV-4-A-PPRV-H-ΔTK protected sheep from virulent PPRV challenge and prevented virus shedding. Protection correlated with anti-PPRV IgGs, neutralizing antibodies and IFN-γ-producing cells induced by the vaccine. Detection of antibodies exclusively against H-PPRV in animal sera and not against other PPRV viral proteins such as F or N could serve as a DIVA diagnostic test when using BoHV-4-A-PPRV-H-ΔTK as vaccine.

The vaccine strain is detected in the tonsil early after inoculation, yet little is known of the role that tonsillar immune cells might play in initiating protection. Comparing the C-strain vaccine with the pathogenic CSFV Alfort-187 strain, changes in the myeloid cell compartment of the tonsil were observed. CSFV infection led to the emergence of an additional CD163+CD14+ cell population, which showed the highest levels of Alfort-187 and C-strain infection. There was also an increase in both the frequency and activation status (as shown by increased MHC-II expression) of the tonsillar conventional dendritic cells 1 (cDC1) in pigs inoculated with the C-strain. Notably, the activation of cDC1 cells coincided in time with the induction of a local CSFV-specific IFN-γ+ CD8 T cell response in C-strain vaccinated pigs, but not in pigs that received Alfort-187. Moreover, the frequency of CSFV-specific IFN-γ+ CD8 T cells was inversely correlated to the viral load in the tonsils of individual animals.

No commercial vaccines are available to prevent African swine fever (ASF), resulting in devastating economic losses to the swine industry. The most advanced vaccine candidates are live attenuated strains developed using a genetically modified virulent parental virus. Recently, we developed a vaccine candidate, ASFV-G-DI177L, by deleting the I177L gene from the genome of the highly virulent ASFV pandemic strain Georgia (ASFV-G). ASFV-GDI177L is safe and highly efficacious in challenge studies using parental ASFV-G. Large-scale production of ASFV-G-DI177L has been limited because it can replicate efficiently only in primary swine macrophages. Here, we present the development of an ASFV-G-DI177L derivative strain, ASFV-G-DI177L/DLVR, that replicates efficiently in a stable porcine cell line. In challenge studies, ASFV-G-DI177L/DLVR maintained the same level of attenuation, immunogenic characteristics, and protective efficacy as ASFV-G-DI177L. ASFV-G-DI177L/DLVR is the first rationally designed ASF vaccine candidate that can be used for large-scale commercial vaccine manufacture. IMPORTANCE African swine fever is currently causing a pandemic resulting in devastating losses to the swine industry. Experimental ASF vaccines rely on the production of vaccine in primary swine macrophages, which are difficult to use for the production of a vaccine on a commercial level. Here, we report a vaccine for ASFV with a deletion in the left variable region (LVR). This deletion allows for growth in stable cell cultures while maintaining the potency and efficacy of the parental vaccine strain. This discovery will allow for the production of an ASF vaccine on a commercial scale. Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.",2021

Interestingly, viremias induced in animals inoculated oronasally were lower than those measured in IM-inoculated ani-mals. ASFV-specific antibody responses, mediated by IgG1, IgG2 and IgM, do not differ in animals inoculated by the ON route from that had IM inoculations.

This vaccine confers early protection in pigs and prevents vertical transmission in pregnant sows. The objectives of this study were to assess the safety of this immunogen in piglets, to compare several doses of antigen in the formulation, and to study the duration of the immunity provided by this vaccine for up to 9 months. Three trials were conducted by immunizing pigs with a two-dose regime of the vaccine. Challenge experiments were carried out with the highly pathogenic Margarita strain. No local or systemic adverse effects were documented, and neither macroscopic nor microscopic pathological findings were observed in the vaccinated animals. The three antigen doses explored were safe and induced CSF protective neutralizing antibodies. The dose of 50 μg was selected for further development because it provided the best clinical and virological protection. Finally, this protective immunity was sustained for at least 9 months. This study demonstrates that E2CD154 vaccine is safe; defines a vaccine dose of 50 μg antigen, and evidences the capacity of this vaccine to confer long term protection from CSFV infection for up to 9 months post- vaccination. These findings complement previous data on the evaluation of this vaccine candidate, and suggest that E2CD154 is a promising alternative to modified live vaccines in CSF endemic areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021

The early clinical signs like fever, depression, and ocular and nasal discharges first appeared at 4–7 days post-infection (dpi). Three out of eight inoculated goats died at 13, 15, and 18 dpi, and the rest were killed at different time points from 5 to 18 dpi. Initially, the virus multiplied mostly in the lymphoid organs of the pharyngeal region and caused extensive lymphoid destruction and hemorrhages. This was followed by viremia, massive virus replication in the lungs, and pneumonia along with the appearance of the clinical signs. Subsequently, the virus spread to other organs causing necrotic and hemorrhagic lesions, as well as the virus localized in the upper respiratory, oral and intestinal mucosa resulting in catarrhal, erosive, and ulcerative lesions. On hematological and biochemical investigation progressive leukopenia and hypoproteinemia, a gradual increase of serum metabolites and enzymes associated with liver and kidney damage, and electrolyte imbalance were observed. Seroconversion started at 7 dpi and all the surviving animals had serum antibodies at 14 dpi. Virus shedding was observed in nasal and ocular secretions at 4 dpi and in feces and urine at 14 dpi, which gradually increased and continued till the end of the experiment (18 dpi) despite seroconversion. Therefore, the virus shedding of naturally infected seroconverted goats should be monitored for effective control strategies. © Copyright © 2021 Begum, Nooruzzaman, Islam and Chowdhury.",2021

ASF is caused by African swine fever virus (ASFV) that consists of a large dsDNA genome that encodes for more than 160 genes; few of these genes have been studied in detail. ASFV contains four multi-gene family (MGF) groups of genes that have been implicated in regulating the immune response and host specificity; however, the individual roles of most of these genes have not been well studied. Here, we describe the evaluation of the previously uncharacterized ASFV MGF110-1L open reading frame (ORF) using a deletion mutant of the ASFV currently circulating throughout Eurasia. The recombinant ASFV lacking the MGF110-1L gene (ASFV-G-∆MGF110-1L) demonstrated in vitro that the MGF110-1L gene is non-essential, since ASFV-G-∆MGF110-1L had similar replication kinetics in primary swine macrophage cell cultures when compared to parental highly virulent field isolate Georgia2007 (ASFV-G). Experimental infection of domestic pigs with ASFV-G-∆MGF110-1L produced a clinical disease similar to that caused by the parental ASFV-G, confirming that deletion of the MGF110-1L gene from the ASFV genome does not affect viral virulence. © 2021 by the authors.

To investigate this, three field isolates were evaluated in experimentally infected piglets and compared with the highly virulent reference Shimen strain. Clinical signs for the field strains ranged from mild to severe, and mortality ranged from 0 to 80 %. These data show differences in virulence among the subgenotype 2.1 field isolates and support the use of field strain GD191 as a genotype 2 challenge virus to assess efficacy of C-strain vaccines. In contrast to the historical genotype 1 strain, which caused acute infection with significant virus shedding in non-vaccinated animals, the subgenotype 2.1 GD191 strain produced different clinical manifestations in weaned piglets and adults. Adult pigs showed subclinical infection with viral shedding, whereas weaned piglets showed overt signs of infection. Efficacy of, and duration of immunity conferred by a C-strain vaccine were assessed using the reference Shimen strain and field isolate GD191 at 12 and 15 months after vaccination. A robust antibody response and sterilising protection were seen in all vaccinated animals and lasted up to 15 months post-vaccination.

The disease can be controlled effectively by vaccination with an attenuated virus known as the “Chinese” (C)-strain. A single vaccination with the C-strain provides complete protection against highly virulent isolates within days after vaccination, making it one of the most efficacious veterinary vaccines ever developed. A disadvantage of the C-strain is that vaccinated animals cannot be serologically differentiated from animals that are infected with wild-type Classical swine fever virus. Previously, a C-strain-based vaccine with a stable deletion in the E2 structural glycoprotein was developed, which allows for differentiation between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA). The resulting vaccine, which we named C-DIVA, is compatible with a commercial E2 ELISA, modified to render it suitable as a DIVA test. In the present work, three groups of eight piglets were vaccinated with escalating doses of the C-DIVA vaccine and challenged two weeks after vaccination. One group of four unvaccinated piglets served as controls. Piglets were monitored for clinical signs until three weeks after challenge and blood samples were collected to monitor viremia, leukocyte and thrombocyte levels, and antibody responses. The presence of challenge virus RNA in oropharyngeal swabs was investigated to first gain insight into the potential of C-DIVA to prevent shedding. The results demonstrate that a single vaccination with 70 infectious virus particles of C-DIVA protects pigs from the highly virulent Brescia strain. © 2021 by the authors.

Better insights into ASFV characteristics and early detection by surveillance could help control its spread. However, the pathogenicity and methods for early detection of ASFV isolates from Vietnam have not been established. Therefore, we investigated the pathogenicity of ASFV and explored alternative sampling methods for early detection. Results: Ten pigs were intramuscularly inoculated with an ASFV strain from Vietnam (titer, 103.5 HAD50/mL), and their temperature, clinical signs, and virus excretion patterns were recorded. In addition, herd and environmental samples were collected daily. The pigs died 5–8 days-post-inoculation (dpi), and the incubation period was 3.7 ± 0.5 dpi. ASFV genome was first detected in the blood (2.2 ± 0.8) and then in rectal (3.1 ± 0.7), nasal (3.2 ± 0.4), and oral (3.6 ± 0.7 dpi) swab samples. ASFV was detected in oral fluid samples collected using a chewed rope from 3 dpi. The liver showed the highest viral loads, and ear tissue also exhibited high viral loads among 11 tissues obtained from dead pigs. Overall, ASFV from Vietnam was classified as peracute to acute form. The rope-based oral fluid collection method could be useful for early ASFV detection and allows successful ASF surveillance in large pig farms. Furthermore, ear tissue samples might be a simple alternative specimen for diagnosing ASF infection in dead pigs. Conclusions: Our data provide valuable insights into the characteristics of a typical ASFV strain isolated in Vietnam and suggest an alternative, non-invasive specimen collection strategy for early detection. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021

The viral genome includes nearly 200 genes, but their expression within infected pigs has not been well characterized previously. In this study, four pigs were infected with a genotype II strain (ASFV POL/2015/Podlaskie); blood samples were collected before inoculation and at both 3 and 6 days later. During this period, a range of clinical signs of infection became apparent in the pigs. From the blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated. The transcription of the ASFV genes was determined using RNAseq on poly(A)+ mRNAs isolated from these cells. Only very low levels of virus transcription were detected in the PBMCs at 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) but, at 6 dpi, extensive transcription was apparent. This was co-incident with a large increase in the level of ASFV DNA within these cells. The pattern of the virus gene expression was very reproducible between the individual pigs. Many highly expressed genes have undefined roles. Surprisingly, some genes with key roles in virus replication were expressed at only low levels. As the functions of individual genes are identified, information about their expression becomes important for understanding their contribution to virus biology. © 2021 by the authors.

There are no commercial vaccines; therefore, disease control relies on identification and culling of infected animals. We report here that the deletion of the ASFV gene A137R from the highly virulent ASFV-Georgia2010 (ASFV-G) isolate induces a significant attenuation of virus virulence in swine. A recombinant virus lacking the A137R gene, ASFV-G-DA137R, was developed to assess the role of this gene in ASFV virulence in domestic swine. Animals inoculated intramuscularly with 102 50% hemadsorption doses (HAD50) of ASFV-G-DA137R remained clinically healthy during the 28-day observational period. All animals inoculated with ASFV-G-DA137R had medium to high viremia titers and developed a strong virus-specific antibody response. Importantly, all ASFV-G-DA137Rinoculated animals were protected when challenged with the virulent parental strain ASFV-G. No evidence of replication of challenge virus was observed in the ASFV-GDA137R-inoculated animals. Therefore, ASFV-G-DA137R is a novel potential live attenuated vaccine candidate and one of the few experimental vaccine strains reported to induce protection against the highly virulent ASFV Georgia virus that is the cause of the current Eurasian pandemic. IMPORTANCE No commercial vaccine is available to prevent African swine fever. The ASF pandemic caused by ASFV Georgia2007 strain (ASFV-G) is seriously affecting pork production in a contiguous area from Central Europe to East Asia. Here we report the rational development of a potential live attenuated vaccine strain by deleting a virus-specific gene, A137R, from the genome of ASFV-G. The resulting virus presented a completely attenuated phenotype and, importantly, animals infected with this genetically modified virus were protected from developing ASF after challenge with the virulent parental virus. ASFV-G-DA137R confers protection even at low doses (102 HAD50), demonstrating its potential as a vaccine candidate. Therefore, ASFV-G-DA137R is a novel experimental ASF vaccine protecting pigs from the epidemiologically relevant ASFV Georgia isolate. Copyright © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

However, it related to induce the transcriptional levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. A deletion mutant of MGF100-1R gene was constructed based on ASFV Chinese strain GZ201801. The recombinant deletion mutant (ASFV△MGF100-1R) was demonstrated in vitro that the gene is non-essential for virus replication with a similar replication kinetics in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) cell cultures when compared to parental virus.

The virus is highly stable over a wide range of temperatures and pH and can survive in meat and meat products for several months, leading to long-distance transmission of ASF. Whole blood, serum, and organs from infected pigs are used routinely as approved sample types in the laboratory diagnosis of ASF. However, these sample types may not always be available. Here, we investigated meat exudate as an alternative sample type for the detection of ASFV-specific nucleic acids and antibodies. Pigs were infected with various ASFV strains: the highly virulent ASFV Malawi LIL 18/2 strain, the moderately-virulent ASFV Estonia 2014 strain, or the low-virulent ASFV OURT/88/3 strain. The animals were euthanized on different days post-infection (dpi), and meat exudates were collected and tested for the presence of ASFV-specific nucleic acids and antibodies. Animals infected with the ASFV Malawi LIL 18/2 developed severe clinical signs and succumbed to the infection within seven dpi, while pigs infected with ASFV Estonia 2014 also developed clinical signs but survived longer, with a few animals seroconverting before succumbing to the ASFV infection or being euthanized as they reached humane endpoints. Pigs infected with ASFV OURT/88/3 developed transient fever and seroconverted without mortality. ASFV genomic material was detected in meat exudate from pigs infected with ASFV Malawi LIL 18/2 and ASFV Estonia 2014 at the onset of viremia but at a lower amount when compared to the corresponding whole blood samples. Low levels of ASFV genomic material were detected in the whole blood of ASFV OURT/88/3-infected pigs, and no ASFV genomic material was detected in the meat exudate of these animals. Anti-ASFV antibodies were detected in the serum and meat exudate derived from ASFV OURT/88/3-infected pigs and in some of the samples derived from the ASFV Estonia 2014-infected pigs. These results indicate that ASFV genomic material and anti-ASFV antibodies can be detected in meat exudate, indicating that this sample can be used as an alternative sample type for ASF surveillance when routine sample types are unavailable or are not easily accessible. © 2021 by the authors.

Eighteen domestic pigs divided into three groups were infected intramuscularly or by direct contact with two haemadsorbent ASFVs (HAD) from Poland (Pol16/DP/ OUT21) and Estonia (Est16/WB/Viru8), and with the Latvian non-HAD ASFV (Lv17/WB/Rie1). Parameters, such as symptoms, pathogenicity, and distribution of the virus in tissues, humoral immune response, and dissemination of the virus by blood, oropharyngeal and rectal routes, were investigated. The Polish ASFV caused a case of rapidly developing fatal acute disease, while the Estonian ASFV caused acute to sub-acute infections and two animals survived. In contrast, animals infected with the ASFV from Latvia developed a more subtle, mild, or even subclinical disease. Oral excretion was sporadic or even absent in the attenuated group, whereas in animals that developed an acute or sub-acute form of ASF, oral excretion began at the same time the ASFV was detected in the blood, or even 3 days earlier, and persisted up to 22 days. Regardless of virulence, blood was the main route of transmission of ASFV and infectious virus was isolated from persistently infected animals for at least 19 days in the attenuated group and up to 44 days in the group of moderate virulence. Rectal excretion was limited to the acute phase of infection. In terms of diagnostics, the ASFV genome was detected in contact pigs from oropharyngeal samples earlier than in blood, independently of virulence. Together with blood, both samples could allow to detect ASFV infection for a longer period. The results presented here provide quantitative data on the spread and excretion of ASFV strains of different virulence among domestic pigs that can help to better focus surveillance activities and, thus, increase the ability to detect ASF introductions earlier. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",2021

In the event of ASFV entry to the North American swine population, enhanced surveillance and diagnostic testing strategies will be critical to facilitate progressive response and eradication of the disease. Compared to individual animal sampling, pen-based oral fluid collection for active surveillance is a non-invasive alternative that is less resource and time-intensive. To evaluate the feasibility of using rope-based oral fluid for early detection of ASFV, four independent animal experiments were conducted in weaned pigs housed in numbers that mimic the industry settings, utilising either highly virulent ASFV Georgia 2007/1 strain or moderately virulent ASFV Malta’78 strain. Pen-based oral fluid and individual oropharyngeal swabs were collected daily and blood samples from each animal were collected every other day. All samples were subsequently tested for ASFV by real-time PCR. ASFV genome was detected in individual blood samples as early as one day post-infection and detected in oral fluids at low-to-moderate levels as early as 3–5 days post-infection in all four independent experiments. These results suggest that pen-based oral fluid samples may be used to supplement the use of traditional samples for rapid detection of ASFV during ASF surveillance. © 2021 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

The disease is spreading throughout primary swine-producing countries with heavy losses in population and revenue. To date, no successful vaccines or medications have been reported. This study aimed to design and develop a blend of natural essential oils and test its efficacy against the ASF virus (ASFV) in swine. Materials and Methods: We attempted to develop a natural oil blend formulation (NOBF) and determine its efficacy against the ASFV. This study follows on from a previously published in vitro study that reported that the NOBF has anti- ASFV properties. A study was designed using 21 healthy piglets of triple-cross (Landrace + Yorkshire + Durok) crossbred pathogen-free pigs with an average weight of 15 kg. The study consisted of NOBF-incubated, NOBF, positive control, and negative control groups. The NOBF groups were administered NOBF (80 mL/ton mixed in drinking water) beginning 10 days before the challenge and continuing throughout the experiment. The positive and negative control pigs consumed regular drinking water. The pigs were challenged by a sublethal dose of pure isolate ASFV strain Vietnam National University of Agriculture-ASFV-L01/HN/04/19 inoculation with 103.5 HAD50/dose through the intramuscular route. There were sic pigs in each group, three pigs directly IM challenged, and three pigs were considered cohoused pigs. Results: Both challenged (three) and cohoused (three) pigs in the positive control showed clinical signs of ASFV infection, as detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in blood samples, oral swabs, and feces. There was 100% cumulative mortality, that is, both challenged and contact pigs died in the positive control group on day 20 of infection. No signs of infection or mortality were observed in the NOBF-incubated group. The challenged pigs in the NOBF-direct challenge group showed clinical signs and mortality, whereas no clinical signs or symptoms occurred in the cohoused pigs. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) level of the contact pigs was the highest in the treatment group and the lowest in the positive control group. The IgM level of the contact pigs in the treatment groups was the lowest, whereas that of the positive control was the highest. The RT-PCR test showed that the ASFV was deactivated in the NOBF-incubated group. The challenged and contact pigs of the positive control group had high Ct values. The challenged pigs of the NOBF group had high Ct values, whereas the contact pigs from the same group and those of the negative control were negative for the ASFV, determined by PCR, in all samples. The comparison of the challenged groups showed that the appearance of the virus was delayed by at least 2 days in the NOBF group compared to the positive control group. Conclusion: The results showed that NOBF can prevent the spread of the ASFV in a population. Moreover, NOBF can enhance the pig humoral immune system by enhancing IgG levels and reducing IgM levels. This study successfully demonstrated that NOBF is an anti-ASFV agent, which prevents horizontal transmission and enhances pig humoral immunity. © 2021 Veterinary World. All rights reserved.",2021

There is no vaccine against ASF, and progress is hindered by a lack of knowledge concerning the extent of ASFV strain diversity and the viral antigens conferring type-specific protective immunity in pigs. We have previously demonstrated that homologous ASFV serotype-specific proteins CD2v (EP402R) and/or C-type lectin are required for protection against challenge with the virulent ASFV strain Congo (Genotype I, Serogroup 2), and we have identified T-cell epitopes on CD2v which may be associated with serotype-specific protection. Here, using a cell-culture adapted derivative of the ASFV strain Congo (Congo-a) with specific deletion of the EP402R gene (δCongoCD2v) in swine vaccination/challenge experiments, we demonstrated that deletion of the EP402R gene results in the failure of δCongoCD2v to induce protection against challenge with the virulent strain Congo (Congov). While δCongoCD2v growth kinetics in COS-1 cells and primary swine macrophage culture were almost identical to parental Congo-a, replication of δCongoCD2v in vivo was significantly reduced compared with parental Congo-a.

So far, most of the studies have been focused on isolates classified within genotypes I and II, the only genotypes that have circulated outside of Africa. However, less is known about the clinical presentations and lesions induced by isolates belonging to the other twenty-two genotypes. Therefore, the early clinicopatholog-ical identification of disease outbreaks caused by isolates belonging to, as yet, not well-characterised ASFV genotypes may be compromised, which might cause a delay in the implementation of control measures to halt the virus spread. To improve the pathological characterisation of disease caused by diverse isolates, we have refined the macroscopic and histopathological evaluation protocols to standardise the scoring of lesions. Domestic pigs were inoculated intranasally with different doses (high, medium and low) of ASFV isolate Ken05/Tk1 (genotype X). To complement previous studies, the distribution and severity of macroscopic and histopathological lesions, along with the amount and distribution of viral antigen in tissues, were characterised by applying the new scoring protocols. The intranasal inoculation of domestic pigs with high doses of the Ken05/Tk1 isolate induced acute forms of ASF in most of the animals. Inoculation with medium doses mainly induced acute forms of disease. A less severe but longer clinical course, typical of subacute forms, characterised by the presence of more widespread and severe haemorrhages and oedema, was observed in one pig inoculated with the medium dose. The severity of vascular lesions (haemorrhages and oedema) induced by high and medium doses was not associated with the amount of virus antigen detected in tissues, therefore these might be attributed to indirect mechanisms not evaluated in the present study. The absence of clinical signs, lesions and detectable levels of virus genome or antigen in blood from the animals inoculated with the lowest dose ruled out the existence of possible asymptomatic carriers or persistently infected pigs, at least for the 21 days period of the study. The results corroborate the moderate virulence of the Ken05/Tk1 isolate, as well as its capacity to induce both the acute and, occasionally, subacute forms of ASF when high and medium doses were administered intranasally. © 2021 by the Crown.

The disease has now spread to Europe and Asia, causing great damage to the pig industry. Although no commercial vaccine with which to control the disease is, as yet, avail-able, some potential vaccine candidates have shown good results in terms of protection. However, little is known about the host immune mechanisms underlying that protection, especially in wild boar, which is the main reservoir of the disease in Europe. Here, we study the role played by two cytokines (IL-10 and IFN-γ) in wild boar orally inoculated with the attenuated vaccine candidate Lv17/WB/Rie1 and challenged with a virulent ASFv genotype II isolate. A group of naïve wild boar challenged with the latter isolate was also established as a control group. Our results showed that both cytokines play a key role in protecting the host against the challenge virus. While high levels of IL-10 in serum may trigger an immune system malfunctioning in challenged animals, the provi-sion of stable levels of this cytokine over time may help to control the disease. This, together with high and timely induction of IFN-γ by the vaccine candidate, could help protect animals from fatal outcomes. Further studies should be conducted in order to support these preliminary results and confirm the role of these two cytokines as potential markers of the evolution of ASFV infection. © 2021 by the authors.

ASFV is a large, structurally complex virus with a large dsDNA genome encoding for more than 160 genes, most of them still uncharacterized. p22, encoded by the ASFV gene KP177R, is an early transcribed, structural virus protein located in the ASFV particle. Although its exact function is unknown, p22 has recently been identified as an interacting partner of several host proteins. Here, we describe the development of a recombinant ASFV (ASFV-G-∆KP177R) lacking the KP177R gene as a tool to evaluate the role of p22 in virus replication and virulence in swine. The recombinant ASFV-G-∆KP177R demonstrated that the KP177R gene is non-essential for ASFV replication in primary swine macrophages, with virus yields similar to those of the parental, highly virulent field isolate Georgia2010 (ASFV-G). In addition, experimental infection of domestic pigs with ASFV-G-∆KP177R produced a clinical disease similar to that caused by the parental ASFV-G. Therefore, and surprisingly, p22 does not seem to be involved in virus replication or virulence in swine. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2021

Neither commercial vaccine nor treatment is available against ASF and, thus far, only live attenuated viruses (LAV) have provided robust protection against lethal ASF virus (ASFV) challenge infections. Identification of ASFV proteins inducing protective immune responses is one of the major challenges to develop safer and efficient subunit vaccines. Immunopeptidomic studies recently performed in our laboratory allowed identifying ASFV antigens recognized by ASFV-specific CD8+ T-cells. Here, we used data from the SLAI-peptide repertoire presented by a single set of ASFV-infected porcine alveolar macrophages to generate a complex DNA vaccine composed by 15 plasmids encoding the individual peptide-bearing ORFs. DNA vaccine priming improved the protection afforded by a suboptimal dose of the BA71∆CD2 LAV given as booster vaccination, against Georgia2007/1 lethal challenge. Interestingly, M448R was the only protein promiscuously recognized by the induced ASFV-specific T-cells. Furthermore, priming pigs with DNA plasmids encoding M488R and MGF505-7R, a CD8+ T-cell antigen previously described, confirmed these two proteins as T-cell antigens with protective potential. These studies might be useful to pave the road for designing safe and more efficient vaccine formulations in the future. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2021

Without a commercially available vaccine, prevention of ASFV entry and spread is reliant on biosecurity and early detection of infection. Although ASFV ingestion in swill or feed by naïve pigs is a likely route of initial introduction, controlled experimental studies rarely utilize natural consumption as the infection route. In the current study, we utilized biological samples collected from pigs 5 days after natural consumption of ASFV in feed and liquid to assess diagnostic sensitivity for early detection of virus infection. Biological samples (serum, spleen, lymph nodes, tonsils, and faeces) were assessed for the presence of ASFV using quantitative PCR and virus isolation. Statistical methods modelled the detection sensitivity of each sample type with each diagnostic assay in individual samples. Our results provide important information that can be incorporated into ASFV surveillance programs. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",2021

Current studies have highlighted the association between the migration of wild birds and the spread of HPAIVs. However, virological studies examining responsible species of migratory birds to spread HPAIVs are limited. In Japan, the common teal (Anas crecca) arrives in great numbers for overwintering every autumn–spring season; therefore, we performed experimental infection using six H5 HPAIVs isolated in past outbreaks in Japan (A/chicken/Yamaguchi/7/2004 (H5N1), A/whooper swan/Akita/1/2008 (H5N1), A/mandarin duck/Miyazaki/22M-765/2011 (H5N1), A/duck/Chiba/26-372-48/2014 (H5N8), A/duck/Hyogo/1/2016 (H5N6) and A/mute swan/Shimane/3211A002/2017 (H5N6)) to evaluate the susceptibility of the species to HPAIV infection. The results illustrated that most birds in all experimental groups were infected by the strains, and they shed viruses for a prolonged period, in trachea than cloaca, without displaying distinctive clinical signs. In addition, comparative analysis using calculation value of total viral shedding during the experiment revealed that the birds shed viruses at above a certain level regardless of the differences of strains. These results suggested that the common teal could be a migratory bird species that disseminates viruses in the environment, thereby influencing HPAI outbreaks in wild birds in Japan. © 2021 The Author(s)",2021

This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the commercial recombinant turkey herpes virus-H5 (rHVT-H5) vaccine (clade 2.2), alone or in combination with commercial inactivated reverse genetically engineered H5N1 vaccine (rgH5N1) (clade 2.2), in preventing the genetically distinct HPAI H5N8 virus of clade 2.3.4.4b in commercial broiler chickens. Four experimental groups of chickens were used as follows: G1, non-vaccinated and non-challenged; G2, non-vaccinated and challenged; G3, vaccinated with rHVT-H5; and G4, prime–boost vaccinated with rHVT-H5/rgH5N1. For challenge with the Egyptian HPAI H5N8 (2.3.4.4b) virus, the groups were divided into two subgroups (A and B); chickens in subgroups A were challenged at the age of 28 days, whereas those in subgroups B were challenged at the age of 35 days. Results showed that a protective efficacy (survival rate) of 40%–50% was obtained in the vaccinated subgroups A. By delaying challenge for 1 week (subgroups B), a single rHVT-H5 vaccination provided 80% protection, whereas prime–boost vaccination induced full protection and reduced viral shedding very efficiently (1/10 birds and only detected on the 3rd day post challenge) against HPAI H5N8 virus (2.3.4.4b). Moreover, body weight loss improved from 31.39% and 43.65% in G3A and G4A, respectively, to 16.34% and 7.7% in G3B and G4B, respectively. The HI titers obtained in G3A and G4A on the challenge day (28th d) using H5N8 antigen were 3 and 3.75 log2 (p &gt; 0.05), respectively, whereas those in G3B and G4B on the challenge day (35th d) were 6.25 and 6 log2 (p &gt; 0.05), respectively, which increased post-challenge in all vaccinated subgroups. Therefore, the dual use of vectored rHVT-H5 and inactivated rgH5N1 vaccines in the vaccination schedule in poultry farms is the most efficient tool for preventing the disease (mortality and viral shedding) caused by the genetically distinct virus (clade 2.3.3.4b HPAI H5N8) in combination with strict biosecurity and sanitary measures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021

This outbreak led to the demise of over 50 million domestic birds and occurred mainly during the northward spring migration of adult avian populations. Objectives: There have been no experimental examinations of the pathogenesis, transmission, and population impacts of this virus in adult wild waterfowl with varying exposure histories—the most relevant age class. Methods: We captured, housed, and challenged adult wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) with HPAIV H5N2 clade 2.3.4.4 and measured viral infection, viral excretion, and transmission to other mallards. Results: All inoculated birds became infected and excreted moderate amounts of virus, primarily orally, for up to 14 days. Cohoused, uninoculated birds also all became infected. Serological status had no effect on susceptibility. There were no obvious clinical signs of disease, and all birds survived to the end of the study (14 days). Conclusions: Based on these results, adult mallards are viable hosts of HPAIV H5N2 regardless of prior exposure history and are capable of transporting the virus over short and long distances. These findings have implications for surveillance efforts. The capture and sampling of wild waterfowl in the spring, when most surveillance programs are not operating, are important to consider in the design of future HPAIV surveillance programs. © 2021 The Authors.

This study assessed the protection efficacy and virus shedding reduction of three different inactivated avian influenza (AI) H5 (H5N1, H5N2, and H5N3) commercial vaccines against challenge with two newly emerging highly pathogenic AI virus H5N8 Egyptian isolates in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chicks. Materials and Methods: 10-day-old SPF chicks (n=260) were divided into 20 groups (n=13). Groups 1-5 were vaccinated through the subcutaneous route (S/C) with 0.5 mL of H5N1 vaccine, Groups 6-10 were vaccinated (S/C) with 0.5 mL of H5N2 vaccine, and Groups 11-15 were vaccinated (S/C) with 0.5 mL of H5N3 vaccine. Positive control groups (16-19) were challenged at 25 and 31 days old (2 and 3 weeks post-vaccination [PV]) using H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 A/duck/Egypt/F13666A/2017(H5N8) and H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 A/chicken/Egypt/18FL6/2018(H5N8). Group 20 was left non-vaccinated as a control. All vaccinated groups were divided and challenged with both viruses at 25 and 31 days of age. The viral challenge dose was 0.1 mL of 106 EID50/0.1 mL titer/chick, and it was administered oronasally. All chicks were kept in isolators for 14 days after each challenge. Sera samples were collected weekly and at 2 weeks post-challenge (PC) to detect a humoral immune response. PC mortalities were recorded daily for 10 days to calculate the protection percentages. Tracheal swabs were collected from the challenged chicks in different groups at 3, 5, 7, and 10 days PC. Kidneys and spleens were collected at 3, 5, 7, and 10 days PC and kept in formalin for histopathological examination to assess lesions and severity scores. Tracheal swabs were inoculated in 10-day-old SPF embryonated chicken eggs for virus titration and to calculate shedding levels. Results: All studied vaccines displayed 70-100% protection within 10 days PC. Hemagglutination inhibition results from sera samples revealed antibody titers ranging from 0.6 to 5.4 log2 starting at 1-week PV with the highest titers at 4 weeks PV. Challenged SPF chickens exhibited a notable reduction in virus shedding, with an average of 1.5-2 log10, compared to control birds. Various histopathological lesions with different scores were detected. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that the inadequate virus shedding reduction and protection efficacy of studied vaccines were variable and that the type of vaccine to be used under field conditions should be reconsidered. Study of the variability between the Egyptian old emerged AI (AIV) 2017 H5N8 strains and the new emerging AIV 2018 H5N8 is required to achieve optimal protection and limit the current economic losses.

While clade 2.2.2 and 2.3.4.2 HPAIVs have not been detected since 2012, clade 2.3.2.1a viruses have caused continuous outbreaks since 2012 despite the use of vaccines. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of two H5 vaccines licensed in Bangladesh, RE-6 inactivated vaccine, and a recombinant herpesvirus of turkeys vaccine with an H5 insert (rHVT-H5), for protection against recent field viruses in chickens. We selected three viruses for efficacy tests (A/chicken/Bangladesh/NRL-AI-3237/2017, A/crow/Bangladesh/NRL-AI-8471/2017 and A/chicken/Bangladesh/NRL-AI-8323/2017) from 36 H5 viruses isolated from Bangladesh between 2016 and 2018 by comparing the amino acid sequences at five antigenic sites (A-E) and analyzing hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers with reference antisera. The RE-6 and rHVT-H5 vaccines both conferred 80–100% clinical protection (i.e. reduced morbidity and mortality) against the three challenge viruses with no significant differences in protection. In addition, both vaccines significantly decreased viral shedding from infected chickens as compared to challenge control chickens. Based on these metrics, the current licensed H5 vaccines protected chickens against the recent field viruses. However, the A/crow/Bangladesh/NRL-AI-8471/2017 virus exhibited antigenic divergence including: several unique amino acid changes in antigenic epitope sites A and B and was a serological outlier in cross HI tests as visualized on the antigenic map. The continuing emergence of such antigenic variants which could alter the dominant antigenicity of field viruses should be continuously monitored and vaccines should be updated if field efficacy declines. © 2021",2021

This virus, A/chicken/Kagawa/11C/2020 (Kagawa11C2020), was the first HPAI poultry isolate in Japan in 2020 and had multiple basic amino acids—a motif conferring high pathogenicity to chickens—at the hemagglutinin cleavage site. Mortality of chickens was 100% through intravenous inoculation tests performed according to World Organization for Animal Health criteria. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the hemagglutinin of Kagawa11C2020 belongs to clade 2.3.4.4B of the H5 Goose/Guangdong lineage and clusters with H5N8 HPAIVs isolated from wild bird feces collected in Hokkaido (Japan) and Korea in October 2020. These H5N8 HPAIVs are closely related to H5N8 HPAIVs isolated in European countries during the winter of 2019–2020. Intranasal inoculation of chickens with 106 fifty-percent egg infectious doses of Kagawa11C2020 revealed that the 50% chicken lethal dose was 104.63 and the mean time to death was 134.4 h. All infected chickens demonstrated viral shedding beginning on 2 dpi—before clinical signs were observed. These results suggest that affected chickens could transmit Kagawa11C2020 to surrounding chickens in the absence of clinical signs for several days before they died. © 2021 by the authors.

Based on the analysis of Indian AIV H5N1 sequences, the conserved regions of extracellular domain of M2 protein (M2e) and HA2 were identified. Synthetic gene construct coding for M2e and two immunodominant HA2 conserved regions was designed and synthesized after codon optimization. The fusion recombinant protein (~38 kDa) was expressed in a prokaryotic system and characterized by Western blotting with anti-His antibody and anti-AIV polyclonal chicken serum. The M2e–HA2 fusion protein was found to be highly reactive with known AIV-positive and -negative chicken sera by ELISA. Two groups of specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens were immunized (i/m) with M2e synthetic peptide and M2e–HA2 recombinant protein along with one control group with booster on the 14th day and 28th day with the same dose and route. Pre-immunization sera and whole blood were collected on day 0 followed by 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days and 2 weeks after the second booster (42 day). Lymphocyte proliferation assay by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) method revealed that the stimulation index (SI) was increased gradually from days 0 to 14 in the immunized group (p < 0.05) than that in control chicken. Toll-like receptor (TLR) mRNA analysis by RT-qPCR showed maximum upregulation in the M2e–HA2-vaccinated group compared to M2e- and sham-vaccinated groups. M2e–HA2 recombinant protein-based indirect ELISA revealed that M2e–HA2 recombinant fusion protein has induced strong M2e and HA2-specific antibody responses from 7 days post-primary immunization, and then the titer gradually increased after booster dose. Similarly, M2e peptide ELISA revealed that M2e–HA2 recombinant fusion protein elicited M2e-specific antibody from day 14 onward. In contrast, no antibody response was detected in the chicken immunized with synthetic peptide M2e alone or control group. Findings of this study will be very useful in future development of broad protective H5N1 influenza vaccine targeting M2e and HA2. © Copyright © 2021 Kalaiyarasu, Bhatia, Mishra, Senthil Kumar, Kumar, Sood, Rajukumar, Ponnusamy, Desai and Singh.",2021

In this study, four H5N6 virus strains were isolated from faecal samples of sick white ducks and dead chickens in Shandong in 2019. These H5N6 viruses were triple-reassortant viruses that have not been previously characterized. Their HA genes were derived from the H5 viruses and were closely related to the vaccine strain Re-11. Their NA genes all fell into the N6-like lineage and the internal gene were derived from H5N1 and H9N2 viruses. They all showed high pathogenicity in mice and caused lethal infection with high rates of transmission in chickens. Moreover, the SPF chickens inoculated with the currently used H5 (Re-11 and Re-12 strains)/H7 (H7-Re-2 strain) trivalent inactivated vaccines in China were completely protected from these four H5N6 viruses. Our study indicated the necessity of continued surveillance for H5 influenza A viruses and the importance of timely update of vaccine strains in poultry industry. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",2021

In the current study, cattle were experimentally exposed to two FMDV strains of different serotypes (O and A). One cohort was simultaneously infected with both viruses, while additional cohorts were initially infected with FMDV A and subsequently superinfected with FMDV O after 21 or 35 days. Coinfections were confirmed during acute infection, with both viruses concurrently detected in blood, lesions, and secretions. Staggered exposures resulted in overlapping infections as convalescent animals with persistent subclinical FMDV infection were superinfected with a heterologous virus. Staggering virus exposure by 21 days conferred clinical protection in six of eight cattle, which were subclinically infected following the heterologous virus exposure. This effect was transient, as all animals superinfected at 35 days post-initial infection developed fulminant FMD. The majority of cattle maintained persistent infection with one of the two viruses while clearing the other. Analysis of viral genomes confirmed interserotypic recombination events within 10 days in the upper respiratory tract of five superinfected animals from which the dominant genomes contained the capsid coding regions of the O virus and nonstructural coding regions of the A virus. In contrast, there were no dominant recombinant genomes detected in samples from simultaneously coinfected cattle. These findings inculpate persistently infected carriers as potential FMDV mixing vessels in which novel strains may rapidly emerge through superinfection and recombination. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

To overcome these limitations, new FMD vaccines must ensure improved safety with non-oil-based adjuvants, a broad spectrum of host defenses within/between serotypes, and the simultaneous induction of cellular and humoral immunity. We designed a novel, immune-potent, recombinant protein rpHSP70-AD that induces robust cellular immunity and elicits a broad spectrum of host defenses against FMD virus (FMDV) infections. We demonstrated that an oil emulsion-free vaccine containing rpHSP70-AD mediates early, mid-term, and long-term immunity and drives potent host protection against FMDV type O and A, suggesting its potential as an FMD vaccine adjuvant in mice and pigs. These results suggest a key strategy for establishing next-generation FMD vaccines, including novel adjuvants. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021

Here we present an in-depth transcriptional analysis of soft-palate tissue from cattle experimentally infected with FMDV. The differentially expressed genes from two Indian cattle (Bos indicus) breeds (Malnad Gidda and Hallikar) and Holstein Friesian (HF) crossbred calves, highlighted the activation of metabolic processes, mitochondrial functions and significant enrichment of innate antiviral immune response pathways in the indigenous calves. The results of RT-qPCR based validation of 12 genes was in alignment with the transcriptome data. The indigenous calves showing lesser virus load, elicited early neutralizing antibodies and IFN-γ immune responses. This study revealed that induction of potent innate antiviral response and cell mediated immunity in indigenous cattle, especially Malnad Gidda, significantly restricted FMDV replication during acute infection. These data highlighting the molecular processes associated with host-pathogen interactions, could aid in the conception of novel strategies to prevent and control FMDV infection in cattle. © 2021 The Authors",2021

To achieve this goal, vaccines with inactivated FMD virus antigen in suitable adjuvants are being used in addition to other control measures. However, only a limited number of vaccine strains are commercially available, which often have a restricted spectrum of activity against the different FMD virus strains in circulation. As a result, when new strains emerge, it is important to measure the efficacy of the current vaccine strains against these new variants. This is important for countries where FMD is endemic but also for countries that hold an FMD vaccine bank, to ensure they are prepared for emergency vaccination. The emergence and spread of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage of viruses posed a serious threat to countries with OIE-endorsed FMD control plans who had not reported FMD for many years. In vitro vaccine-matching results showed a poor match (r1-value &lt; 0.3) with the more widely used vaccine strain O1 Manisa and less protection in a challenge test. This paper describes the use of the O3039 vaccine strain as an alternative, either alone or in combination with the O1 Manisa vaccine strain with virulent challenge by a O/ME-SA/Ind-2001d sub-lineage virus from Algeria (O/ALG/3/2014). The experiment included challenge at 7 days post-vaccination (to study protection and emergency use) and 21 days post-vaccination (as in standard potency studies). The results indicated that the O3039 vaccine strain alone, as well as the combination with O1 Manisa, is effective against this strain of the O/ME-SA/Ind/2001d lineage, offering protection from clinical disease even after 7 days post-vaccination with a reduction in viraemia and virus excretion. © 2021 by the authors.

A high potency vaccine that stimulates the host immune response is the foremost strategy used to prevent disease persistence in endemic regions. FMD vaccines comprise inactivated virus antigens whose immunogenicity is potentiated by immunogenic adjuvants. Oil-based adjuvants have clear advantages over traditional adjuvant vaccines; however, there is potential to develop novel adjuvants to increase the potency of FMD vaccines. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a novel water-in-oil emulsion, called CAvant®SOE, as a novel vaccine adjuvant for use with inactivated FMD vaccines. In this study, we found that inactivated A22 Iraq virus plus CAvant®SOE (iA22 Iraq-CAvant®SOE) induced effective antigen-specific humoral (IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a) and cell-mediated immune responses (IFN-γ and IL-4) in mice. Immunization of pigs with a single dose of iA22 Iraq-CAvant®SOE also elicited effective protection, with no detectable clinical symptoms against challenge with heterologous A/SKR/GP/2018 FMDV. Levels of protection are strongly in line with vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody titers. Collectively, these results indicate that CAvant®SOE-adjuvanted vaccine is a promising candidate for control of FMD in pigs. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2021

Therefore, a novel local vaccine that can cover various topotypes of viruses is required. Two virus strains, O/Boeun/SKR/2017 and A/Yeoncheon/SKR/2017, were cultured up to the pilot scale based on the optimized conditions set up on the flask scale. FMDV particles (146S) of 2 µg/mL or more were obtained from the virus culture supernatant using a 100 L bioreactor. The viruses were fully inactivated using binary ethylenimine within 16 h through two inactivation cycles and mixed with an adjuvant into a bivalent vaccine (types O and A) consisting of 15 µg viruses per strain. The experimental bivalent vaccine showed a broad spectrum of high neutralizing antibody titers against heterologous viruses, including type O Cathay strain and type A Asia topotypes, except for GVII. The 50% protective dose was determined as 12.5 for O/Boeun/SKR/2017 and 15.6 for A/Yeoncheon/SKR/2017. Collectively, we expect that the bivalent vaccine could protect against FMDV types O and A circulating in South Korea and neighboring countries.

LSD is endemic in Africa and has recently emerged in Europe and central Asia as a major threat to cattle industry. BT caused great economic damage in Europe during the last decade with a continuous spread to other countries. To control these diseases, vaccination is the only economically viable tool. For LSD, only live-attenuated vaccines (LAVs) are commercially available, whilst for BT both LAVs and inactivated vaccines are available with a limited number of serotypes. In this study, we developed an inactivated, oil adjuvanted bivalent vaccine against both diseases based on LSDV Neethling strain and BTV4. The vaccine was tested for safety and immunogenicity on cattle during a one-year period. Post-vaccination monitoring was carried out by VNT and ELISA. The vaccine was completely safe and elicited high neutralizing antibodies starting from the first week following the second injection up to one year. Furthermore, a significant correlation (R = 0.9040) was observed when comparing VNT and competitive ELISA in BTV4 serological response. Following BTV4 challenge, none of vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle were registered clinical signs, however vaccinated cattle showed full protection from viraemia. In summary, this study highlights the effectiveness of this combined vaccine as a promising solution for both LSD and BT control. It also puts an emphasis on the need for the development of other multivalent inactivated vaccines, which could be greatly beneficial for improving vaccination coverage in endemic countries and prophylaxis of vector-borne diseases. © 2021",2021
