It is found mainly in areas where both the parasite and its vector are endemic and is one of the most challenging infectious diseases in the world to control. HIV infected patients are vulnerable to Leishmania infections, and the main reservoir hosts of Leishmania infantum parasites are domestic dogs. Here, we evaluated the long-term efficacy of treatment with meglumine antimoniate plus allopurinol (G1) compared to miltefosine plus allopurinol (G2) in dogs naturally infected L. infantum. Methods: Eighteen dogs with leishmaniosis were divided into the following two groups: G1 (n = 9) was treated subcutaneously with meglumine antimoniate (100 mg/kg/day/30 days) plus allopurinol (10 mg/kg/per day/30 days), while G2 (n = 9) was treated orally with miltefosine (2 mg/Kg/day/30 days) plus allopurinol (10 mg/kg/day/30 days). Thereafter, the same dose of allopurinol was administered to both groups for 6 years. Leishmania DNA in lymph node aspirates from the G1 and G2 dogs was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR at baseline and every 3 months for 24 months, and then at 28, 36, 48, 60 and 72 months. At each assessment, the dogs were examined for signs of disease, and their clinical scores were recorded. Results: Both combination therapies produced significant clinical improvements in the dogs, with a significant reduction in the parasitic load in the lymph nodes of the dogs from both groups after 3 months of treatment. Clinical relapses were observed in four dogs from G2 (miltefosine/allopurinol), and just one dog from G1 (meglumine antimoniate/allopurinol). All dogs that relapsed had increased clinical scores, and increased anti-Leishmania antibody titers and parasitic loads in their lymph nodes. Conclusions: Long-term, the clinical and laboratory findings of the G1 dogs were more stable than those of the G2 dogs, thus indicating that meglumine antimoniate had better clinical efficacy than miltefosine. The results suggest that treatment with allopurinol as a maintenance therapy is crucial for stabilizing the care of canine",2015

Nosocomial cases and outbreaks of CCHF have been reported from many countries. Health care workers (HCWs) are at risk of exposure to CCHF. In our study, we evaluated seven HCWs' exposure to confirmed CCHF patients' infected blood and body fluids and prophylactic efficacy of the ribavirin on nosocomial transmission of CCHF retrospectively. Between 2007 and 2013, 150 CCHF cases were admitted to our clinic. During the follow-up of these patients, four doctors and three nurses had contact with infected blood and body fluids through needle stick injury, contact of skin and mucosal surfaces, and probable aerosolization. All of the index cases' diagnoses of CCHF were confirmed during the contact. Ribavirin prophylaxis was administered within 0.5-1 h in six out of seven cases. All of these cases' CCHF virus PCR results were negative. One physician had no contact with infected blood or body fluid, so ribavirin prophylaxis was not administered. The physician developed CCHF and diagnosis was confirmed. Although efficacy of ribavirin for prophylaxis is not clear and very few data exist on prophylactic usage of ribavirin, lack of clinical manifestations in our cases that were given ribavirin compared with the developed clinical manifestations in the physician may be explained by the prophylactic efficacy of the ribavirin.",2014

Methods: A total of 219 dogs, negative for L. infantum were enrolled in a multicentre, controlled study. Dogs were divided into two homogeneous groups, defined as G1 (n = 102) and G2 (n = 117). Before the start of the sand fly season, dogs in G1 were treated with the collar while animals in G2 were left untreated, serving as negative controls. Dogs were serially sampled on day D90, D180, D210 and D300 in order to assess Leishmania infection by IFAT, PCR on skin (D210-D300) and bone marrow (D300) and cytology on bone marrow aspirate (D300). Results: Three dogs (2.9%) in G1 and 41 (40.2%) in G2 became positive for L. infantum in at least one of the diagnostic tests employed in the study. The number of seropositive dogs in G2 increased in the course of the study from 15 (D90) to 41 (D300), with some of them also positive in other diagnostic tests. Eight (19.6%) of the seropositive dogs in G2 showed an increase in antibody titers ranging from 1:160 to 1:1,280. At the last follow-up, some of dogs in G2 displayed overt clinical signs suggestive of leishmaniosis. The mean incidence density rate at the final follow-up was 4.0% for G1 and 60.7% for G2, leading to a mean efficacy of the collar in protecting dogs at both sites of 93.4%. Conclusions: The slow-release collar tested in this study was shown to be safe and highly effective in preventing L. infantum infection in a large population of dogs. Protection conferred by a single collar (up to eight months) spanned an entire sand fly season in a hyper-endemic area of southern Italy. The regular use of collars, at least during the sand fly season, may represent a reliable and sustainable strategy for the prevention of leishmaniosis in dogs living in or travelling to an endemic area.",2014

These findings encouraged us to use rLdccys1 in the immunotherapy of naturally infected dogs from Teresina, Piaui, a region of high incidence of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil. Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty naturally infected mongrel dogs displaying clinical signs of visceral leishmaniasis were randomly divided in three groups: one group received three doses of rLdccys1 in combination with the adjuvant Propionibacterium acnes at one month interval between each dose; a second group received three doses of P. acnes alone; a third group received saline. The main findings were: 1) dogs that received rLdccys1 with P. acnes did not display increase of the following clinical signs: weight loss, alopecia, onychogryphosis, cachexia, anorexia, apathy, skin lesions, hyperkeratosis, ocular secretion, and enlarged lymph nodes; they also exhibited a significant reduction in the spleen parasite load in comparison to the control dogs; 2) rLdccys1-treated dogs exhibited a significant delayed type cutaneous hypersensitivity elicited by the recombinant antigen, as well as high IgG2 serum titers and low IgG1 serum titers; sera from rLdccys1-treated dogs also contained high IFN-gamma and low IL-10 concentrations; 3) control dogs exhibited all of the clinical signs of visceral leishmaniasis and had low serum IgG2 and IFN-gamma levels and high concentrations of IgG1 and IL-10; 4) all of the dogs treated with rLdccys1 were alive 12 months after treatment, whereas dogs which received either saline or P. acnes alone died within 3 to 7 months. Conclusions/Significance: These findings illustrate the potential use of rLdccys1 as an additional tool for the immunotherapy of canine visceral leishmaniasis and support further studies designed to improve the efficacy of this recombinant antigen for the treatment of this neglected disease.",2014

Animals were treated according to the specific therapeutic protocol, and the presence of H. canis gamonts was assessed weekly by cytology and PCR throughout six months (T1-T19). In addition, any abnormality in leucocyte morphology was evaluated and recorded. Results indicate that, in spite of a reduction in the percentage of infected dogs, both treatments did not provide parasitological cure.

Twenty mongrel dogs presenting clinical symptoms compatible with leishmaniasis and diagnosis confirmed by the detection of anti-leishmania antibodies were studied. Ten dogs received 15 doses of the immunomodulator (2.0 mg/kg) intramuscularly, and 10 received saline as a placebo. Skin and peripheral blood samples were collected following administration of the immunomodulator. The groups were followed to observe for clinical signals of remission; parasite load in the skin biopsies using real-time PCR, the cytokines IL-2, IL-10 and IFN-gamma, in the supernatant of peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro with either total promastigote antigen or phytohemagglutinin measured by capture ELISA, and changes in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subpopulations evaluated by flow cytometry. Comparison between the groups showed that treatment with the immunomodulator promoted improvement in clinical signs and a significant reduction in parasite load in the skin. In peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures, supernatants showed a decrease in IL-10 levels and an increase in IL-2 and IFN-gamma. An increase in CD8(+) T cells was observed in peripheral blood. In addition, the in vitro leishmanicidal action of P-MAPA was investigated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-y1)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MU) and no leishmanicidal activity was detected. These findings suggest that P-MAPA has potential as an immunotherapeutic drug in canine visceral leishmaniasis, since it assists in reestablishing partial immunocompetence of infected dogs.

The purpose of this study is to compare treated cases with severe thrombocytopenia using ribavirin with high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) with patients receiving ribavirin without HDMP. A clinical trial was conducted for confirmed patients with CCHF and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 50,000/mL) admitted to Boo-Ali Hospital in Zahedan between January 2010 and October 2011. The intervention group was given oral ribavirin, supportive managements and HDMP and the controls were treated with ribavirin and supportive management.

Descalzo, Ricardo Molina","Infectivity to Phlebotomus perniciosus of dogs naturally parasitized with Leishmania infantum after different treatments","Background: In Europe most dogs with clinical leishmaniosis are treated with leishmanicides, typically antimonials combined with allopurinol and good clinical recovery is observed in a high number of these dogs. Through xenodiagnosis, the capacity of a treated animal to infect the vector of the disease under treatment is assessed as a measure of the chemotherapeutic efficacy of the drug used. The objective of the present study was to evaluate through direct xenodiagnosis the infectivity to Phlebotomus perniciosus of dogs naturally parasitized with Leishmania infantum after treatment, and to follow the clinical and parasite course of disease. Thirty two dogs with clinical leishmaniosis were assigned to one of three treatment groups: meglumine antimoniate plus allopurinol (Group A), meglumine antimoniate (Group B) or allopurinol (Group C). During the study, the dogs were examined before treatment (Day 0) and bimonthly thereafter until Day 180 (six months post-treatment onset). Results: The three groups were scored over time according to the effects of treatment on clinical signs and clinical-pathological variables. Significant differences in clinical scores were observed between Group A and the other two groups, indicating the combined treatment was the most effective. After treatment, bone marrow cultures were positive for the parasite in 30.8% of dogs in some of the check ups (3 or 25% in Group A, 1 or 11.1% in Group B, and 4 or 80% in Group C). Our xenodiagnosis experiments revealed that 15.4% of treated dogs were still able to infect sand flies at some point after treatment (2 dogs or 16.6% in Group A, 2 or 22.2% in Group B and none in Group C). Only 7.7% of the entire study population could infect sand flies as from the second month post-treatment onset. Conclusion: The three treatment regimens tested significantly reduced the infectivity of dogs towards sand flies, thus diminishing the epidemiological risks of treated dogs both for human beings and other healthy dogs. Despite its low cure rate, the use of allopurinol after a course of leishmanicide treatment is proposed to keep dogs noninfectious during the disease transmission season (4-6 months in southern Europe).",2011

One hundred eleven autochthonous young dogs were divided into group A (n = 63) and group B (n = 48), both groups containing dogs positive and negative for one or more CVBD-causing pathogens. Additionally, 10 naive male beagles were introduced in each group in May 2008. Group A was treated with ImPer on day 0 and every 21 2 days whereas group B was left untreated. Blood and skin samples were collected at baseline (March-April 2008) and at the first, second and third follow-up times (July and October 2008 and April 2009). Bone marrow was sampled at baseline and at the third follow-up. Serological, cytological and molecular tests were performed to detect Anaplasma platys, Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Dirofilaria immitis, Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis and Leishmania infantum. Ectoparasites (fleas, ticks, and sand flies) were monitored throughout the study. The baseline prevalence of CVBDs was 39.6% with 44 dogs positive for at least one pathogen. A. platys (27.5%) and Babesia spp. (15.6%) were the most prevalent species and co-infections with up to two pathogens were detected in 16 (14.7%) individuals. At the end of the evaluation period, there was a 90.7% reduction in overall CVBD incidence density rate (IDR) in group A, as following: 100% reduction in L infantum; 94.6% in E. canis; 94.4% in Babesia spp.; and 81.8% in A. platys. Initially positive treated dogs showed significantly lower pathogen prevalence at the third follow-up than untreated ones. At the end of the evaluation period, 8 of the 10 untreated beagles were infected with at least one pathogen whereas one of the treated beagles was A. platys positive at a single time point (second follow-up). Overall efficacy against ticks was 97.9%. In October 2009, samples were collected from the remaining 83 dogs (44 from group A and 39 from group B) to investigate the annual incidence of CVBDs in the same, at this time untreated, dog population. A high year incidence for tick-borne diseases (78.1%) and for L infantum (13.6%) was detected in dogs from group A. seven months after the treatment had been withdrawn. The results demonstrate that ImPer preventive treatment against arthropods protects autochthonous and naive beagle dogs against CVBD-causing pathogens. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In the literature, prospective randomized studies investigating the efficacy of ribavirin are not found. Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of ribavirin in treatment of patients with CCHF. Study design: In this prospective randomized cohort study 136 cases were included between June 2004 and August 2007. The diagnosis was confirmed in the CCHF reference laboratory of Refik Saydam National Hygiene Central Institute of the Turkish Ministry of Health. Patients either received ribavirin plus supportive treatment (Group A) (n = 64) or only supportive treatment (Group B) (n = 72). For the evaluation of efficacy of ribavirin, various parameters were compared between Group A and Group B. Results: As well as the similarity of demographic features between the two groups, there were no statistical differences in incubation time; hospitalization time; patients requiring platelet replacement therapy; the time taken for platelet levels to return to normal levels and mortality. In Group B, the rate of tick contact was higher (p = 0.03). In Group A, leukocyte levels took longer to return to the normal levels (p = 0.02). Conclusion: In our study, there was no positive effect determined on clinical or laboratory parameters in CCHF patients treated with ribavirin, also it was observed that leukocyte levels took longer to return to normal (p = 0.02) and, while not statistically significant, the longer period of hospitalization (p = 0.09) needed was observed as a negative effect. Because of these reasons, it is thought that the use of ribavirin makes no significant contribution to the prognosis of the CCHF disease. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2010

Methods: In 2004, all patients diagnosed with CCHF were treated with oral ribavirin, however in 2003 none of the CCHF patients had been given treatment due to Lack of confirmatory diagnostic information at that time in Turkey. In this study, patients treated with ribavirin in 2004 (n = 126) were compared with ribavirin-untreated CCHF patients (n = 92) in 2003. Patients only with a definitive diagnosis of CCHF (clinical symptoms plus the presence of specific IgM antibodies against CCHF virus and presence of viral antigen) were included in this study. Results: There was no difference in the case-fatality rate between treated and untreated patients (7.1% vs. 11.9%; P > 0.05). A Cox Proportional Hazards regression analysis revealed that altered sensorium and prolonged international normalized ratio were independent predictors of mortality. Conclusion: Our results showed that oral ribavirin treatment did not improve the survival rate in CCHF patients. Ribavirin and supportive care are the only available choices for treatment of CCHF patients, but to ascertain the efficacy of ribavirin, more laboratory and observational studies are necessary and ultimately, to elucidate these conflicting results and evaluate the efficacy undoubtedly, a multicenter randomised controlled trial will be needed.

Groups of 12 animals received by the intravenous route four doses (with 4-day intervals) of either liposomal meglumine antimoniate (group I [GI], 6.5 mg Sb/kg of body weight/dose), empty liposomes (GII), or isotonic saline (GIII). Evaluation of markers of hematopoietic, hepatic, and renal functions before and just after treatment showed no significant change. On the other hand, transitory adverse reactions, including prostration, defecation, tachypnea, and sialorrhea, were observed during the first 15 min after injections in GI and GII. Parasitological evaluation of sternal bone marrow 4 days after the last dose showed a significant reduction of parasite burden in GI, compared to the other groups. Immunocytochemical evaluations of the skin, bone marrow, cervical lymph nodes, livers, and spleens of dogs for parasites, 150 days after treatment, indicated significant parasite suppression (higher than 95.7%) in the lymph nodes, livers, and spleens of GI, compared to control groups. Feeding of Lutzomyia longipalpis phlebotomines on dogs from GI, 150 days after treatment, resulted in a significant reduction of sand fly infection efficiency, compared to feeding on animals from GII and GIII. This is the first report of both long-term parasite suppression and reduction of infectivity to sand flies in naturally infected dogs following treatment with a liposome-encapsulated drug.

When we adjusted for maximum incubation period of the virus from infection to onset of symptoms, no new cases were reported in either of the treated areas after adulticiding; 18 new cases were reported in the untreated area of Sacramento County during this time. Results indicated that the odds of infection after spraying were, approximate to 6x higher in the untreated area than in treated areas, and that the treatments successfully disrupted the WNV transmission cycle.

Rai, J. Chakravarty, D. Agarwal, N. Agrawal, Michel Vaillant, Piero Olliaro, Henry W. Murray","New treatment approach in Indian visceral leishmaniasis: Single-dose liposomal amphotericin B followed by short-course oral miltefosine","Background. In Bihar, India, home to nearly one-half of the world's burden of visceral leishmaniasis, drug resistance has ended the usefulness of pentavalent antimony, which is the traditional first-line treatment. Although monotherapy with other agents is available, the use of 2 drugs with different modes of action might increase efficacy, shorten treatment duration, enhance compliance, and/or reduce the risk of parasite resistance. To test the feasibility of a new approach to combination therapy in visceral leishmaniasis (also known a kala-azar), we treated Indian patients with a single infusion of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB), followed 1 day later by short-course oral miltefosine. Methods. We used a randomized, noncomparative, group-sequential, triangular design and assigned 181 subjects to treatment with 5 mg/kg of L-AmB alone (group A; 45 subjects), 5 mg/kg of L-AmB followed by miltefosine for 10 days (group B; 46 subjects) or 14 days (group C; 45 subjects), or 3.75 mg/kg of L-AmB followed by miltefosine for 14 days (group D; 45 subjects). When it became apparent that all regimens were effective, 45 additional, nonrandomized patients were assigned to receive 5 mg/kg of L-AmB followed by miltefosine for 7 days (group E). Results. Each regimen was satisfactorily tolerated, and all 226 subjects showed initial apparent cure responses. Nine months after treatment, final cure rates were similar: group A, 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78% 97%]; group B, 98% (95% CI, 87%-100%); group C, 96% (95% CI, 84%-99%]; group D, 96% (95% CI, 84%-99%); and group E, 98% (95% CI, 87%-100%). Conclusions. These results suggest that treatment with single-dose L-AmB followed by 7-14 days of miltefosine is active against Indian kala-azar. This short-course, sequential regimen warrants additional testing in India and in those regions of endemicity where visceral leishmaniasis may be more difficult to treat.",2008

Outcome at discharge and 3 months did not differ between the two treatment groups; 20 children in the interferon group had a poor outcome (death or severe sequelae), compared with 18 in the placebo group (p=0.85, difference 0.1%, 95% CI-17.5 to 17.6%), there were no long-term side effects of interferon. Interpretation The doses of interferon alfa-2a given in this regimen did not improve the outcome of patients with Japanese encephalitis.",2003

In southern Europe. where canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is widespread due to L. infantum, killing seropositive dogs is considered unacceptable and drug treatment has low efficacy in preventing transmission. We made a field evaluation of the efficacy of deltamethrin dog collars in a CanL focus of southern Italy, Mount Vesuvius area of Campania region. where the vector is Phlebotomus perniciosus Newstead (Diptera: Psychodidae). by assessing their impact on the incidence of CanL in an intervention town. compared to that in dogs of control towns where no collars were fitted. During two consecutive transmission seasons, collars were fitted to 350 (1998) and 354 (1999) dogs from San Sebastiano al Vesuvio (70% of the canine population). Control dogs (371 and 264 in the 2 years, respectively) were from four towns of the same area. Before each transmission season, the CanL seroprevalence in the intervention and control towns was evaluated by cross-sectional surveys and found to be similar (about 15% in 1998 and 10% in 1999, respectively). After each transmission period, incidence rates of seroconversions,Acre determined in adult dogs that were serologically negative before the season under evaluation. and in puppies. After the 1998 season. 2.7% of the dogs in the intervention town seroconverted compared to 5.4% in the control towns (50% protection. P=0.15). After the 1999 season, 3.5% of collared dogs seroconverted compared to 25.8% of control dogs (86% protection, P<0.001). The increase in seroconversion rates recorded in control dogs suggests an increase in the Leishmania force of infection in the canine reservoir during the 1999 sandfly season. as supported by the concomitant increase of human cases in control towns and in the whole Campania region. Our results suggest that the impact of mass use of deltamethrin-impregnated dog collars on the incidence of CanL may be negligible during low transmission seasons, or probably in low endemic foci, but can be very strong when the force of transmission is high.",2001

Ninety-six dogs included in this study were determined to have leishmaniasis on the basis of (1) clinical features, (2) identification of the parasite in smears of lymph node, bone marrow aspirates, or skin biopsies, and (3) specific immunofluorescent assay. Three groups of dogs were defined: 45 dogs (group 1) were treated with antimony (100 mg/kg SC q24h) given concurrently for 1 month with allopurinol (15 mg/kg PO q12h), and then allopurinol alone for 8 months at the same dosage; 40 dogs (group 2) were treated with antimony alone according to the manufacturer's instructions (200 mg/kg SC q24h at 2-day intervals for 3-6 months); and 11 dogs (group 3) were treated with allopurinol alone (15 mg/kg PO q12h for 1-20 months). Information concerning signalment, history, physical examination findings, serologic testing and number of dogs becoming seronegative, outcome for each treated dog (clinical cure versus failure), and long-term survival were recorded. The numbers of the clinical cures versus failures were significantly different among the 3 groups (chi(2) = 17.77, P < .001), between groups 1 and 2 (chi(2) = 8.02, P < .01), between groups 2 and 3 (chi(2) = 11.00, P < .01), and between groups 1 and 3 (chi(2) = 16.52, P < .001). No significant difference between groups 1 and 2 was noted in the type of failure (relapse or death), serologic test results, and number of survival years (chi(2) = 2.79. P > .05). The results of the present study indicate that antimony in combination with allopurinol produces better results than antimony alone or allopurinol alone for the treatment of the canine leishmaniasis.

The drug prevented fever and other clinical signs in six cattle when given daily during the incubation period, and at 8-h intervals for 5 days when clinical disease might be expected. When treatment with PBZ was deferred until 2-4 h after the commencement of fever, the rectal temperature returned to normal within 4 h in four of six cattle and the development of other clinical signs was suppressed. Clinical signs of ephemeral fever occurred in four untreated cattle infected at the same time. Viraemia, the development of neutralizing antibodies (at 8-11 days), resistance to subsequent challenge with BEF virus, neutrophilia, lymphopenia and a rise in plasma fibrinogen occurred in all BEF-infected animals whether treated or untreated, despite different clinical appearances. The mean peak of plasma fibrinogen in the untreated cattle was 6.9 g l-1; 3.2 g l-1 when treated 2-4 h after fever developed and 3.8 g l-1 when treated from 18-h post-infection. BEF virus was isolated from leucocytes of each of the cattle, but the frequency of isolation was lower in the treated group. The results indicate that treatment with PBZ blocked the host response which produces the clinical signs and did not have an anti-viral effect.

All untreated control animals required treatment for redwater between days 23 and 32 and eight of them then contracted heartwater of which five died despite therapy. Four animals from the group receiving two injections of oxytetracycline and one receiving three injections also contracted redwater but rather later. During the initial 35 day assessment period it was noticed that the majority of Boophilus ticks failed to engorge on the oxytetracycline-treated animals. In the second phase of the trial theileriosis (T. mutans-type) became evident in many animals and appeared to precipitate new or recrudescent clinical redwater and heartwater in several of them.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1989

This ascitic fluid, but not those containing other, non-neutralizing anti-BTV-17 antibodies of the same isotype, provided serotype-specific passive protection against BTV-17-induced death of neonatal mice. Antibody 6C2A.4.2-containing ascitic fluid was injected intravenously into sheep that were later inoculated with BTV-17. These sheep remained free of clinical signs, did not develop viremia or detectable levels of antibodies reactive in the immunodiffusion test used for routine BTV diagnosis in the United States, and developed only low levels of neutralizing antibodies. Control animals became viremic and developed immunodiffusion test reactions and high levels of neutralizing antibodies during recovery, and two of three had lesions and fevers.

Design: Paired cluster randomised controlled trial designed to detect a 50% reduction in incidence of Leishmania donovani infection. Setting: Villages in Muzaffarpur district in India and Saptari, Sunsari, and Morang districts in Nepal. Participants: 13 intervention and 13 control clusters. 12691 people were included in the analysis of the main outcome (infection), and 19810 were enrolled for the secondary (disease) end point. Intervention: Longlasting insecticidal nets (treated with deltamethrin) were distributed in the intervention clusters in December 2006. Main outcome measures: Infection was determined by direct agglutination test at 12 and 24 months after the intervention in those who had negative results (titre <1:1600) at baseline. The effect estimate was computed as the geometric mean of the risk ratios for seroconversion for each cluster pair (net/no net), with its 95% confidence interval.

In February 2005, out of 845 dogs initially tested for CanL, 631 dogs which tested negative (315 from a kennel in Bari (KB) and 316 from a kennel in Ginosa (KG)) in a serological and a parasitological examination were allocated to one of three groups: Group A-treated with imidacloprid 10% and permethrin 50% once a month; Group B-treated every 2 weeks; and Group C-untreated control animals. All the dogs were examined serologically and parasitologically for CanL prior to the start of the study, in November 2005 (end of the sandfly season) and in March 2006 (end of the study). An initial CanL seroprevalence of 24.7% (209 dogs) was detected in KB and KG. In KB Leishmania infection, inferred by positivity in at least one of the three tests performed at the interim or final follow-up, was found in one animal from Group A and in nine from Group C. No positive animals were detected in Group B, thus giving a final protection efficacy of 88.9% in Group A and 100% in Group B. In KG Leishmania infection was identified in one animal from Groups A and B, respectively, and I I from Group C (protection efficacy of 90.36% in Group A and 90.73% in Group B). The incidence density rates (IDRs) of infection in both Groups A and B at each kennel were statistically significantly lower than that registered in Group C (KB p < 0.05 and KG p < 0.01). The results clearly show that a combination of imidacloprid 10% and permethrin 50%, by virtue of its repellent activity against sandflies, is effective under both application regimes in preventing CanL in the field in endemic areas.

In the study of malaria, soldiers were issued impregnated uniforms (i,e., a shirt, an undershirt, pants, socks, and a hat) or uniforms washed in water; the soldiers wore the uniforms day and night for a mean of 4.2 weeks and were observed for an additional 4 weeks.

Otranto","Prevention of feline leishmaniosis with an imidacloprid 10%/flumethrin 4.5% polymer matrix collar","Background: Leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is one of the most important vector-borne diseases affecting animals and humans worldwide. Dogs are considered main reservoirs of the zoonotic forms, though in the last years the role of cats as reservoirs has been increasingly investigated. Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) occurs in endemic areas and no specific preventive measures have been investigated so far. In this study the efficacy of a 10% imidacloprid/4.5% flumethrin polymer matrix collar, licensed for tick and flea prevention, has been assessed against FeL in a longitudinal study on 204 privately owned cats from the Aeolian islands (Sicily), an area highly endemic for the disease. From March to May 2015 [Study Day 0 (SD 0)], cats negative for FeL were collared (G1, n = 104) or left untreated (G2, n = 100). Diagnosis consisted of serology and qPCR on blood and conjunctival swabs, which were collected at baseline (SD 0) and at the end of the study (SD 360). Interim clinical examinations were performed on SD 210 (when collars were replaced in G1) and SD 270. Results: Of the 159 cats which completed the study, 5 in G1 and 20 in G2 were positive for L. infantum infection, in at least one of the diagnostic tests leading to a yearly crude incidence of 6.3% and 25.0% in G1 and G2, respectively (P = 0.0026). This translates into an efficacy of the collar of 75.0% in preventing feline Leishmania infection. The collar was generally well tolerated with no systemic adverse reactions and few local skin reactions were observed in the application area in four out of 104 treated cats (3.8%). Conclusions: The 10% imidacloprid/4.5% flumethrin collar significantly reduced the risk of L. infantum infection in cats. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which a preventative strategy against feline Leishmania infection is assessed under natural conditions. These findings close a gap in veterinary medicine, in that they confirm this collar as a tool in reducing the risk of Leishmania infection in cats. Such a preventative tool could contribute to the reduction of the risk of the disease in animal and in human populations when included in integrated leishmaniosis control programmes. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017

Cerón","Randomized, allopurinol-controlled trial of the effects of dietary nucleotides and active hexose correlated compound in the treatment of canine leishmaniosis","First-line treatment for canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is N-methylglucamine antimoniate (MGA) combined with allopurinol. However, in some dogs allopurinol may induce hyperxanthinuria leading to urolithiasis. Moreover, allopurinol resistance has recently been described in Leishmania infantum isolates from treated dogs with a relapse of the disease. Alternative treatments are thus needed. Since the type of host immune response strongly influences CanL progression and prognosis, dogs could benefit from treatments targeted at modulating such response, such as nucleotides and active hexose correlated compound (AHCC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an oral combination of nucleotides and AHCC in dogs with clinical leishmaniosis. Sixty-nine dogs with naturally-occurring clinical leishmaniosis were included in this multicenter, open-label, positively-controlled clinical trial and randomized to receive 10 mg/kg allopurinol PO BID (allopurinol group) or 17 mg/kg AHCC plus 32 mg/kg nucleotides PO SID (supplement group) for 180 days. All dogs were also given 50 mg/kg MGA SC BID during the first 28 days. At the time points 0, 30, and 180 days of the trial, dogs underwent a clinical examination, and blood, urine, and bone marrow samples were submitted for analytical tests. Final data analyses (allopurinol group: n = 29; supplement group: n = 24) revealed a significant improvement in both groups in clinical scores and ELISA-determined antibody titers after treatment. However, the supplement group showed a significantly lower clinical score (P = 0.005) and significantly higher antibody titers (P = 0.032) after 180 days, compared to the allopurinol group. RT-PCR parasite loads were reduced in groups (mean ± SD supplement: 0.38 ± 0.56 vs 5.23 ± 18.9; allopurinol: 0.45 ± 1.47 vs 3.09 ± 8.36 parasites/ng of DNA), but there were no significant differences over time or between groups. During the study, 12 dogs in the allopurinol group developed xanthinuria (41%) compared to no dogs (0%) in the supplement group (P = 0.000). Both treatments led to significantly increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and improvements in protein electrophoretic pattern and acute phase response. In conclusion, 6-month oral treatment with nucleotides and AHCC in addition to MGA showed similar efficacy to the current first-line treatment for CanL, without producing xanthinuria. This combination could be a good alternative to MGA-allopurinol combination treatment for CanL, especially for dogs suffering allopurinol-related adverse events. © 2017 The Author(s)",2017

The use of repellent insecticides aids to reduce the risk of pathogen transmission. The primary objective of this 5-month serological field study conducted in a highly endemic area of canine leishmaniosis in Greece was to comparatively assess the effectiveness of a topical formulation of fipronil/permethrin (Frontline Tri-Act®/Frontect®) and of a deltamethrin collar (Scalibor®) for the prevention of Leishmania infantum transmission. Initially, 72 clinically healthy owned dogs were sampled for inclusion. Ten out of the 72 (13.8%) were seropositive according to the Snap Leish® ELISA test and removed. Ultimately, a total of 56 dogs were followed from May to October 2015 with monthly blood samples and serological tests based on Snap Leish® and Snap 4Dx® ELISA tests. Twenty-five dogs were treated with deltamethrin collar (Scalibor®) (Group 1) and 31 were treated monthly with the topical fipronil/permethrin formulation (Group 2). In group 1, three dogs out of 25 (12%) seroconverted for Leishmania whereas none of the dogs (0/31) seroconverted in group 2. In addition, this trial provided means to serological assess the transmission of other vector-borne pathogens. Regarding Anaplasma spp., one dog in each group was seropositive at the beginning of the study and no dogs became positive during the study. For Ehrlichia canis, 9/25 (36%) dogs in group 1 and 5/31 (16.1%) in group 2 were seropositive at inclusion time. Two out of 16 (11.8%) and 3/26 (11.5%) dogs became positive for E. canis after 3 months in groups 1 and 2, respectively. No Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato seropositive dog was found during the study. In regard to Dirofilaria immitis, 7/25 (28%) dogs and 12/31 (38.7%) were antigen-positive in groups 1 and 2, respectively, at inclusion. There was no significant difference between groups 1 and 2 in regard to new seroconversions during the trial. This study, conducted in a highly endemic area for vector-borne pathogen transmission, confirmed that the use of deltamethrin and permethrin is a suitable approach to reduce the risk of L. infantum infection by sandflies. © 2016 The Authors",2017

Singh","Role of oral Minocycline in acute encephalitis syndrome in India - a randomized controlled trial","Background: Acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) is a public health problem in India. Neuroinfections are believed to be the most important etiology. Minocycline is a semisythetic tetracycline having excellent penetration into cerebrospinal fluid, established neuroprotective and antiviral properties besides action on nonviral causes of AES. It has been shown to be effective in animal model of Japanese encephalitis (JE). A randomized, controlled trial of nasogastric/oral minocycline in JE and AES at a single centre in Uttar Pradesh, northern India, was therefore conducted. Methods: Patients beyond 3 years of age - but excluding women aged 16-44 years - hospitalized with AES of &lt; =7 days duration were enrolled and block randomized to receive nasogastric/oral minocycline or placebo suspension and followed up. Patients, study personnel and those entering data were blinded as to drug or placebo received. Primary outcome was cumulative mortality at 3 months from hospitalization. Analysis was by intention to treat. Results: 281 patients were enrolled, 140 received drug and 141 placebo. While there was no overall statistically significant difference in 3 month mortality between drug and placebo groups [RR = 0 · 83 (0 · 6-1 · 1)], there were encouraging trends in patients older than 12 years [RR = 0.70 (0.41-1.18)] and in Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) at 3 months (χ2 = 7 · 44, p = 0 · 059). These trends were further accentuated if patients dying within one day of reaching hospital were excluded [OR for 3 month mortality =0 · 70 (0 · 46-1 · 07), p = 0.090; 3 month GOS p = 0 · 028]. Conclusions: A trend towards better outcomes was observed with minocycline, especially in those patients who survived the initial day in hospital. These findings should form the basis for planning a larger study and possibly including minocycline in the initial management of AES as seen here.

Dogs were clients to 17 veterinary practices and were analyzed for Leishmania infantum antibodies in blood plasma using two commercial ELISAs (Ingezim, Ingenasa®, Spain; Leishcan, Hipra®, Spain). Owners were interviewed to gather data on dog related variables. They included date of birth, home address and frequency, duration and timing of insecticide treatments used to prevent ectoparasite infestations. The dog's residence was georeferenced and environmental data potentially associated with the dog's risk of L. infantum infection was obtained. A mixed logistic regression model was then developed to analyze the relationship between the dog's serological status and insecticidal treatment adjusted for demographic and environmental variables. Overall, CanL seroprevalence (95% confidence limits) was 18% (16-21%) including 11% in dogs not using insecticide treatments (n=60) and 19% in those using them (n=740) (p>0.05). At least 16 different insecticide products were used and 73%, 26% and 1% of dogs received 1, 2 and 3 products a year. The most frequent commercial brands used and the only ones in the market claiming anti-sandfly activity, were Scalibor collars (deltametrin 40mg/g; MSD®), Advantix pipettes (permethrin 500mg/ml and imidacloprid 100mg/ml; Bayer®) and Exspot spot-on pipettes (permethrin 715mg/ml; MSD®). Seroprevalence was 9%, 16%, 20%, 22% and 25% for dogs with Scalibor collars plus Advantix pipettes, Scalibor collars plus ExSpot pipettes, Advantix pipettes alone, Scalibor collars alone and Exspot pipettes alone, respectively. The multivariable model confirmed a significant reduction in the risk of Leishmania spp. seropositivity in dogs using the Scalibor and Advantix combination compared to those using either product alone and provided evidence of greatly increased risk of CanL in rural areas situated at 300-500m altitude and average March-July temperatures of 18.6-19°C. The study highlights the difficulty in controlling CanL infection by means of insecticide use alone and that it could be improved by using the Scalibor and Advantix combination and identifying and targeting specific geographical areas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",2016

An in vivo test was also performed on 36 dogs with leishmaniasis, subdivided into three groups, one treated with enrofloxacin, another with enrofloxacin plus metronidazole, and a control group with meglumine antimoniate. The direct test did not show any action of enrofloxacin on the parasite, while the indirect testing showed an enhancement of macrophage killing and an increase in nitric oxide production. These findings show that enrofloxacin does not exert a direct anti-leishmanial activity in vitro. However, on the basis of the positive immunostimulation results shown in vitro and the clinical improvement, particularly of the cutaneous lesions, obtained in several dogs in the in vivo trial, the use of enrofloxacin in association with a specific anti-leishmanial drug can be proposed in the therapeutic protocol of canine leishmaniasis. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",2004
