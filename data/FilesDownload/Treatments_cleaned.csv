It is found mainly in areas where both the parasite and its vector are endemic and is one of the most challenging infectious diseases in the world to control. HIV infected patients are vulnerable to Leishmania infections, and the main reservoir hosts of Leishmania infantum parasites are domestic dogs. Here, we evaluated the long-term efficacy of treatment with meglumine antimoniate plus allopurinol (G1) compared to miltefosine plus allopurinol (G2) in dogs naturally infected L. infantum. Methods: Eighteen dogs with leishmaniosis were divided into the following two groups: G1 (n = 9) was treated subcutaneously with meglumine antimoniate (100 mg/kg/day/30 days) plus allopurinol (10 mg/kg/per day/30 days), while G2 (n = 9) was treated orally with miltefosine (2 mg/Kg/day/30 days) plus allopurinol (10 mg/kg/day/30 days). Thereafter, the same dose of allopurinol was administered to both groups for 6 years. Leishmania DNA in lymph node aspirates from the G1 and G2 dogs was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR at baseline and every 3 months for 24 months, and then at 28, 36, 48, 60 and 72 months. At each assessment, the dogs were examined for signs of disease, and their clinical scores were recorded. Results: Both combination therapies produced significant clinical improvements in the dogs, with a significant reduction in the parasitic load in the lymph nodes of the dogs from both groups after 3 months of treatment. Clinical relapses were observed in four dogs from G2 (miltefosine/allopurinol), and just one dog from G1 (meglumine antimoniate/allopurinol). All dogs that relapsed had increased clinical scores, and increased anti-Leishmania antibody titers and parasitic loads in their lymph nodes. Conclusions: Long-term, the clinical and laboratory findings of the G1 dogs were more stable than those of the G2 dogs, thus indicating that meglumine antimoniate had better clinical efficacy than miltefosine.

It is found mainly in areas where both the parasite and its vector are endemic and is one of the most challenging infectious diseases in the world to control. HIV infected patients are vulnerable to Leishmania infections, and the main reservoir hosts of Leishmania infantum parasites are domestic dogs. Here, we evaluated the long-term efficacy of treatment with meglumine antimoniate plus allopurinol (G1) compared to miltefosine plus allopurinol (G2) in dogs naturally infected L. infantum. Methods: Eighteen dogs with leishmaniosis were divided into the following two groups: G1 (n = 9) was treated subcutaneously with meglumine antimoniate (100 mg/kg/day/30 days) plus allopurinol (10 mg/kg/per day/30 days), while G2 (n = 9) was treated orally with miltefosine (2 mg/Kg/day/30 days) plus allopurinol (10 mg/kg/day/30 days). Thereafter, the same dose of allopurinol was administered to both groups for 6 years. Leishmania DNA in lymph node aspirates from the G1 and G2 dogs was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR at baseline and every 3 months for 24 months, and then at 28, 36, 48, 60 and 72 months. At each assessment, the dogs were examined for signs of disease, and their clinical scores were recorded. Results: Both combination therapies produced significant clinical improvements in the dogs, with a significant reduction in the parasitic load in the lymph nodes of the dogs from both groups after 3 months of treatment. Clinical relapses were observed in four dogs from G2 (miltefosine/allopurinol), and just one dog from G1 (meglumine antimoniate/allopurinol). All dogs that relapsed had increased clinical scores, and increased anti-Leishmania antibody titers and parasitic loads in their lymph nodes. Conclusions: Long-term, the clinical and laboratory findings of the G1 dogs were more stable than those of the G2 dogs, thus indicating that meglumine antimoniate had better clinical efficacy than miltefosine.

Methods: Eighteen dogs with leishmaniosis were divided into the following two groups: G1 (n = 9) was treated subcutaneously with meglumine antimoniate (100 mg/kg/day/30 days) plus allopurinol (10 mg/kg/per day/30 days), while G2 (n = 9) was treated orally with miltefosine (2 mg/Kg/day/30 days) plus allopurinol (10 mg/kg/day/30 days). Thereafter, the same dose of allopurinol was administered to both groups for 6 years. Leishmania DNA in lymph node aspirates from the G1 and G2 dogs was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR at baseline and every 3 months for 24 months, and then at 28, 36, 48, 60 and 72 months. At each assessment, the dogs were examined for signs of disease, and their clinical scores were recorded. Results: Both combination therapies produced significant clinical improvements in the dogs, with a significant reduction in the parasitic load in the lymph nodes of the dogs from both groups after 3 months of treatment. Clinical relapses were observed in four dogs from G2 (miltefosine/allopurinol), and just one dog from G1 (meglumine antimoniate/allopurinol). All dogs that relapsed had increased clinical scores, and increased anti-Leishmania antibody titers and parasitic loads in their lymph nodes. Conclusions: Long-term, the clinical and laboratory findings of the G1 dogs were more stable than those of the G2 dogs, thus indicating that meglumine antimoniate had better clinical efficacy than miltefosine. The results suggest that treatment with allopurinol as a maintenance therapy is crucial for stabilizing the care of canine",2015

Here, we evaluated the long-term efficacy of treatment with meglumine antimoniate plus allopurinol (G1) compared to miltefosine plus allopurinol (G2) in dogs naturally infected L. infantum. Methods: Eighteen dogs with leishmaniosis were divided into the following two groups: G1 (n = 9) was treated subcutaneously with meglumine antimoniate (100 mg/kg/day/30 days) plus allopurinol (10 mg/kg/per day/30 days), while G2 (n = 9) was treated orally with miltefosine (2 mg/Kg/day/30 days) plus allopurinol (10 mg/kg/day/30 days).

At each assessment, the dogs were examined for signs of disease, and their clinical scores were recorded. Results: Both combination therapies produced significant clinical improvements in the dogs, with a significant reduction in the parasitic load in the lymph nodes of the dogs from both groups after 3 months of treatment.

Methods: A total of 219 dogs, negative for L. infantum were enrolled in a multicentre, controlled study. Dogs were divided into two homogeneous groups, defined as G1 (n = 102) and G2 (n = 117). Before the start of the sand fly season, dogs in G1 were treated with the collar while animals in G2 were left untreated, serving as negative controls. Dogs were serially sampled on day D90, D180, D210 and D300 in order to assess Leishmania infection by IFAT, PCR on skin (D210-D300) and bone marrow (D300) and cytology on bone marrow aspirate (D300). Results: Three dogs (2.9%) in G1 and 41 (40.2%) in G2 became positive for L. infantum in at least one of the diagnostic tests employed in the study. The number of seropositive dogs in G2 increased in the course of the study from 15 (D90) to 41 (D300), with some of them also positive in other diagnostic tests. Eight (19.6%) of the seropositive dogs in G2 showed an increase in antibody titers ranging from 1:160 to 1:1,280. At the last follow-up, some of dogs in G2 displayed overt clinical signs suggestive of leishmaniosis. The mean incidence density rate at the final follow-up was 4.0% for G1 and 60.7% for G2, leading to a mean efficacy of the collar in protecting dogs at both sites of 93.4%. Conclusions: The slow-release collar tested in this study was shown to be safe and highly effective in preventing L. infantum infection in a large population of dogs. Protection conferred by a single collar (up to eight months) spanned an entire sand fly season in a hyper-endemic area of southern Italy. The regular use of collars, at least during the sand fly season, may represent a reliable and sustainable strategy for the prevention of leishmaniosis in dogs living in or travelling to an endemic area.",2014

Based on the absence of a consensus on the treatment regimes for canine hepatozoonosis, the present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of imidocarb dipropionate (5-6 mg/kg subcutaneously once a week for 6 weeks), and of toltrazuril/emodepside (Procox (R), 15 mg/kg once a day for 6 days) in association with clindamycin (15 mg/kg once a day for 21 days) in treating naturally infected dogs. At the enrolment time (TO), 32 dogs, cytologically or molecularly positive for H. canis, were assigned to test and control groups. Animals were treated according to the specific therapeutic protocol, and the presence of H. canis gamonts was assessed weekly by cytology and PCR throughout six months (T1-T19). In addition, any abnormality in leucocyte morphology was evaluated and recorded. Results indicate that, in spite of a reduction in the percentage of infected dogs, both treatments did not provide parasitological cure.

The purpose of this study is to compare treated cases with severe thrombocytopenia using ribavirin with high-dose methylprednisolone (HDMP) with patients receiving ribavirin without HDMP. A clinical trial was conducted for confirmed patients with CCHF and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 50,000/mL) admitted to Boo-Ali Hospital in Zahedan between January 2010 and October 2011. The intervention group was given oral ribavirin, supportive managements and HDMP and the controls were treated with ribavirin and supportive management. Following HDMP therapy in hospitalized patients with severe thrombocytopenia, the platelet count increased within 36h and the leukocyte count within 48h of the beginning of treatment. Fewer in the intervention group required a transfusion of blood products than in the controls (P<0.001). No one in the intervention group died. It seems that high-dose methylprednisolone is effective in the treatment of patients with CCHF. The increased platelet count and reduction of blood product requirement for severe CCHF patients after receiving HDMP are promising results.

This study investigated the efficacy of a polymer matrix collar containing a combination of 10% imidacloprid and 4.5% flumethrin as a novel prophylactic measure to prevent L. infantum infections in young dogs from a hyper-endemic area of southern Italy, with a view towards enhancing current control strategies against both human and canine leishmaniosis. Methodology/Principal Findings: The study was carried out on 124 young dogs, of which 63 were collared (Group A) while 61 were left untreated (Group B), from March-April 2011 until March 2012. Blood and skin samples were collected at baseline (April 2011) and at the first, second, third and fourth follow-up time points (July, September 2011 and November 2011, and March 2012, respectively). Bone marrow and conjunctiva were sampled at baseline and at the fourth follow-up. Serological, cytological and molecular tests were performed to detect the presence of L. infantum in the different tissues collected. At the end of the trial, no dog from Group A proved positive for L. infantum at any follow-up, whereas 22 dogs from Group B were infected (incidence density rate = 45.1%); therefore, the combination of 10% imidacloprid and 4.5% flumethrin was 100% efficacious for the prevention of L. infantum infection in young dogs prior to their first exposure to the parasite in a hyper-endemic area for CanL. Conclusions: The use of collars containing 10% imidacloprid and 4.5% flumethrin conferred long-term protection against infection by L. infantum to dogs located in a hyper-endemic area, thus representing a reliable and sustainable strategy to decrease the frequency and spread of this disease among the canine population which will ultimately result in the reduction of associated risks to human health.",2013

Through xenodiagnosis, the capacity of a treated animal to infect the vector of the disease under treatment is assessed as a measure of the chemotherapeutic efficacy of the drug used. The objective of the present study was to evaluate through direct xenodiagnosis the infectivity to Phlebotomus perniciosus of dogs naturally parasitized with Leishmania infantum after treatment, and to follow the clinical and parasite course of disease. Thirty two dogs with clinical leishmaniosis were assigned to one of three treatment groups: meglumine antimoniate plus allopurinol (Group A), meglumine antimoniate (Group B) or allopurinol (Group C). During the study, the dogs were examined before treatment (Day 0) and bimonthly thereafter until Day 180 (six months post-treatment onset). Results: The three groups were scored over time according to the effects of treatment on clinical signs and clinical-pathological variables. Significant differences in clinical scores were observed between Group A and the other two groups, indicating the combined treatment was the most effective. After treatment, bone marrow cultures were positive for the parasite in 30.8% of dogs in some of the check ups (3 or 25% in Group A, 1 or 11.1% in Group B, and 4 or 80% in Group C). Our xenodiagnosis experiments revealed that 15.4% of treated dogs were still able to infect sand flies at some point after treatment (2 dogs or 16.6% in Group A, 2 or 22.2% in Group B and none in Group C). Only 7.7% of the entire study population could infect sand flies as from the second month post-treatment onset. Conclusion: The three treatment regimens tested significantly reduced the infectivity of dogs towards sand flies, thus diminishing the epidemiological risks of treated dogs both for human beings and other healthy dogs. Despite its low cure rate, the use of allopurinol after a course of leishmanicide treatment is proposed to keep dogs noninfectious during the disease transmission season (4-6 months in southern Europe).",2011

Thirty two dogs with clinical leishmaniosis were assigned to one of three treatment groups: meglumine antimoniate plus allopurinol (Group A), meglumine antimoniate (Group B) or allopurinol (Group C). During the study, the dogs were examined before treatment (Day 0) and bimonthly thereafter until Day 180 (six months post-treatment onset). Results: The three groups were scored over time according to the effects of treatment on clinical signs and clinical-pathological variables. Significant differences in clinical scores were observed between Group A and the other two groups, indicating the combined treatment was the most effective. After treatment, bone marrow cultures were positive for the parasite in 30.8% of dogs in some of the check ups (3 or 25% in Group A, 1 or 11.1% in Group B, and 4 or 80% in Group C). Our xenodiagnosis experiments revealed that 15.4% of treated dogs were still able to infect sand flies at some point after treatment (2 dogs or 16.6% in Group A, 2 or 22.2% in Group B and none in Group C). Only 7.7% of the entire study population could infect sand flies as from the second month post-treatment onset. Conclusion: The three treatment regimens tested significantly reduced the infectivity of dogs towards sand flies, thus diminishing the epidemiological risks of treated dogs both for human beings and other healthy dogs. Despite its low cure rate, the use of allopurinol after a course of leishmanicide treatment is proposed to keep dogs noninfectious during the disease transmission season (4-6 months in southern Europe).",2011

The objective of the present study was to evaluate through direct xenodiagnosis the infectivity to Phlebotomus perniciosus of dogs naturally parasitized with Leishmania infantum after treatment, and to follow the clinical and parasite course of disease. Thirty two dogs with clinical leishmaniosis were assigned to one of three treatment groups: meglumine antimoniate plus allopurinol (Group A), meglumine antimoniate (Group B) or allopurinol (Group C). During the study, the dogs were examined before treatment (Day 0) and bimonthly thereafter until Day 180 (six months post-treatment onset). Results: The three groups were scored over time according to the effects of treatment on clinical signs and clinical-pathological variables. Significant differences in clinical scores were observed between Group A and the other two groups, indicating the combined treatment was the most effective. After treatment, bone marrow cultures were positive for the parasite in 30.8% of dogs in some of the check ups (3 or 25% in Group A, 1 or 11.1% in Group B, and 4 or 80% in Group C).

Only 7.7% of the entire study population could infect sand flies as from the second month post-treatment onset. Conclusion: The three treatment regimens tested significantly reduced the infectivity of dogs towards sand flies, thus diminishing the epidemiological risks of treated dogs both for human beings and other healthy dogs.

A longitudinal study was conducted in southern Italy to determine the incidence of and protection against CVBD-causing pathogens in dogs treated with a combination of imidacloprid 10% and permethrin 50% (ImPer). One hundred eleven autochthonous young dogs were divided into group A (n = 63) and group B (n = 48), both groups containing dogs positive and negative for one or more CVBD-causing pathogens. Additionally, 10 naive male beagles were introduced in each group in May 2008. Group A was treated with ImPer on day 0 and every 21 2 days whereas group B was left untreated. Blood and skin samples were collected at baseline (March-April 2008) and at the first, second and third follow-up times (July and October 2008 and April 2009). Bone marrow was sampled at baseline and at the third follow-up. Serological, cytological and molecular tests were performed to detect Anaplasma platys, Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Dirofilaria immitis, Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis and Leishmania infantum. Ectoparasites (fleas, ticks, and sand flies) were monitored throughout the study. The baseline prevalence of CVBDs was 39.6% with 44 dogs positive for at least one pathogen. A. platys (27.5%) and Babesia spp. (15.6%) were the most prevalent species and co-infections with up to two pathogens were detected in 16 (14.7%) individuals. At the end of the evaluation period, there was a 90.7% reduction in overall CVBD incidence density rate (IDR) in group A, as following: 100% reduction in L infantum; 94.6% in E. canis; 94.4% in Babesia spp.; and 81.8% in A. platys. Initially positive treated dogs showed significantly lower pathogen prevalence at the third follow-up than untreated ones. At the end of the evaluation period, 8 of the 10 untreated beagles were infected with at least one pathogen whereas one of the treated beagles was A. platys positive at a single time point (second follow-up). Overall efficacy against ticks was 97.9%. In October 2009, samples were collected from the remaining 83 dogs (44 from group A and 39 from group B) to investigate the annual incidence of CVBDs in the same, at this time untreated, dog population. A high year incidence for tick-borne diseases (78.1%) and for L infantum (13.6%) was detected in dogs from group A. seven months after the treatment had been withdrawn.

Methods: In 2004, all patients diagnosed with CCHF were treated with oral ribavirin, however in 2003 none of the CCHF patients had been given treatment due to Lack of confirmatory diagnostic information at that time in Turkey. In this study, patients treated with ribavirin in 2004 (n = 126) were compared with ribavirin-untreated CCHF patients (n = 92) in 2003. Patients only with a definitive diagnosis of CCHF (clinical symptoms plus the presence of specific IgM antibodies against CCHF virus and presence of viral antigen) were included in this study. Results: There was no difference in the case-fatality rate between treated and untreated patients (7.1% vs. 11.9%; P > 0.05). A Cox Proportional Hazards regression analysis revealed that altered sensorium and prolonged international normalized ratio were independent predictors of mortality. Conclusion: Our results showed that oral ribavirin treatment did not improve the survival rate in CCHF patients. Ribavirin and supportive care are the only available choices for treatment of CCHF patients, but to ascertain the efficacy of ribavirin, more laboratory and observational studies are necessary and ultimately, to elucidate these conflicting results and evaluate the efficacy undoubtedly, a multicenter randomised controlled trial will be needed.

Japanese encephalitis is associated with high rates of mortality and disabling sequelae. To date, no specific antiviral has proven to be of benefit for this condition. We attempted to determine the efficacy of oral ribavirin treatment for reducing early mortality among children with Japanese encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh, India. Methods. Children (age, 6 months to 15 years) who had been hospitalized with acute febrile encephalopathy (a <= 2-week history of fever plus altered sensorium) were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin M antibodies to Japanese encephalitis virus with commercial immunoglobulin M capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Children with positive results were randomized to receive either ribavirin (10 mg/kg per day in 4 divided doses for 7 days) or placebo syrup through nasogastric tube or by mouth. The primary outcome was early mortality; secondary outcome measures were early (at hospital discharge; normal or nearly normal, independent functioning, dependent, vegetative state, or death) outcome, time to resolution of fever, time to resumption of oral feeding, duration of hospitalization, and late outcome (>= 3 months after hospital discharge). The study was double-blind, and analysis was by intention to treat. Results. A total of 153 patients were enrolled during a 3-year period; 70 patients received ribavirin, and 83 received placebo. There was no statistically significant difference between the 2 groups in the early mortality rate: 19 (27.1%) of 70 ribavirin recipients and 21 (25.3%) of 83 placebo recipients died (odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-2.4). No statistically significant differences in secondary outcome measures were found. Conclusions.

In Bihar, India, home to nearly one-half of the world's burden of visceral leishmaniasis, drug resistance has ended the usefulness of pentavalent antimony, which is the traditional first-line treatment. Although monotherapy with other agents is available, the use of 2 drugs with different modes of action might increase efficacy, shorten treatment duration, enhance compliance, and/or reduce the risk of parasite resistance. To test the feasibility of a new approach to combination therapy in visceral leishmaniasis (also known a kala-azar), we treated Indian patients with a single infusion of liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB), followed 1 day later by short-course oral miltefosine. Methods. We used a randomized, noncomparative, group-sequential, triangular design and assigned 181 subjects to treatment with 5 mg/kg of L-AmB alone (group A; 45 subjects), 5 mg/kg of L-AmB followed by miltefosine for 10 days (group B; 46 subjects) or 14 days (group C; 45 subjects), or 3.75 mg/kg of L-AmB followed by miltefosine for 14 days (group D; 45 subjects). When it became apparent that all regimens were effective, 45 additional, nonrandomized patients were assigned to receive 5 mg/kg of L-AmB followed by miltefosine for 7 days (group E). Results. Each regimen was satisfactorily tolerated, and all 226 subjects showed initial apparent cure responses. Nine months after treatment, final cure rates were similar: group A, 91% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78% 97%]; group B, 98% (95% CI, 87%-100%); group C, 96% (95% CI, 84%-99%]; group D, 96% (95% CI, 84%-99%); and group E, 98% (95% CI, 87%-100%).

Forty per cent (38/95) of these dogs were not reexamined and retested at the end of the trial for reasons unrelated to CL. None of the remaining 57 dogs exhibited the symptomatic form of the disease at the end of the 1-year follow-up period. Of the 15 allopurinol-treated dogs that were non-infected (negative PCR and tissue smear microscopy) at the beginning of the trial, 6 (40% P=0.03) became PCR-positive, of which 3 became also seropositive, at the end of the observation period. In contrast, only 1 of 7 (14.3%) placebo-treated non-infected dogs became PCR positive at the same time point. Of the 19 allopurinol-treated dogs that were infected (PCR-positive) at the beginning of the trial, 18 (94.7%) remained PCR-positive and one (5.3%) seroconverted, at the end of the observation period. Of the 16 initially infected and placebo-treated dogs, 14 (87.5%) remained PCR positive, of which one (6.7%) also turned positive by tissue smear microscopy.

Kontos","Periodic administration of allopurinol is not effective for the prevention of canine leishmaniosis (Leishmania infantum) in the endemic areas","A total of 95 clinically healthy and seronegative for Leishmania infantum dogs, residing an area highly endemic for canine leishmaniosis (CL) and living an outdoor life-style, were split into positive and negative groups, and then were randomly assigned to receive allopurinol (n=51; 20 mg/kg once daily), or placebo (n=44) for I week per month, from April to November. Forty per cent (38/95) of these dogs were not reexamined and retested at the end of the trial for reasons unrelated to CL. None of the remaining 57 dogs exhibited the symptomatic form of the disease at the end of the 1-year follow-up period. Of the 15 allopurinol-treated dogs that were non-infected (negative PCR and tissue smear microscopy) at the beginning of the trial, 6 (40% P=0.03) became PCR-positive, of which 3 became also seropositive, at the end of the observation period. In contrast, only 1 of 7 (14.3%) placebo-treated non-infected dogs became PCR positive at the same time point. Of the 19 allopurinol-treated dogs that were infected (PCR-positive) at the beginning of the trial, 18 (94.7%) remained PCR-positive and one (5.3%) seroconverted, at the end of the observation period. Of the 16 initially infected and placebo-treated dogs, 14 (87.5%) remained PCR positive, of which one (6.7%) also turned positive by tissue smear microscopy. Therefore, it is concluded that the use of allopurinol, at the daily dose of 20 mg/kg, for 1 week per month, during the period of sandfly activity, does not prevent the infection of non-infected dogs by L infantum, and, also, does not help in the elimination of the parasite from dogs with asymptomatic infections.

In southern Europe. where canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is widespread due to L. infantum, killing seropositive dogs is considered unacceptable and drug treatment has low efficacy in preventing transmission. We made a field evaluation of the efficacy of deltamethrin dog collars in a CanL focus of southern Italy, Mount Vesuvius area of Campania region. where the vector is Phlebotomus perniciosus Newstead (Diptera: Psychodidae). by assessing their impact on the incidence of CanL in an intervention town. compared to that in dogs of control towns where no collars were fitted. During two consecutive transmission seasons, collars were fitted to 350 (1998) and 354 (1999) dogs from San Sebastiano al Vesuvio (70% of the canine population).

Ninety-six dogs included in this study were determined to have leishmaniasis on the basis of (1) clinical features, (2) identification of the parasite in smears of lymph node, bone marrow aspirates, or skin biopsies, and (3) specific immunofluorescent assay. Three groups of dogs were defined: 45 dogs (group 1) were treated with antimony (100 mg/kg SC q24h) given concurrently for 1 month with allopurinol (15 mg/kg PO q12h), and then allopurinol alone for 8 months at the same dosage; 40 dogs (group 2) were treated with antimony alone according to the manufacturer's instructions (200 mg/kg SC q24h at 2-day intervals for 3-6 months); and 11 dogs (group 3) were treated with allopurinol alone (15 mg/kg PO q12h for 1-20 months). Information concerning signalment, history, physical examination findings, serologic testing and number of dogs becoming seronegative, outcome for each treated dog (clinical cure versus failure), and long-term survival were recorded. The numbers of the clinical cures versus failures were significantly different among the 3 groups (chi(2) = 17.77, P < .001), between groups 1 and 2 (chi(2) = 8.02, P < .01), between groups 2 and 3 (chi(2) = 11.00, P < .01), and between groups 1 and 3 (chi(2) = 16.52, P < .001). No significant difference between groups 1 and 2 was noted in the type of failure (relapse or death), serologic test results, and number of survival years (chi(2) = 2.79. P > .05). The results of the present study indicate that antimony in combination with allopurinol produces better results than antimony alone or allopurinol alone for the treatment of the canine leishmaniasis. With combination treatment, duration of treatment with antimony is shorter and long-term administration of allopurinol is well tolerated.",1999

Ninety-six dogs included in this study were determined to have leishmaniasis on the basis of (1) clinical features, (2) identification of the parasite in smears of lymph node, bone marrow aspirates, or skin biopsies, and (3) specific immunofluorescent assay. Three groups of dogs were defined: 45 dogs (group 1) were treated with antimony (100 mg/kg SC q24h) given concurrently for 1 month with allopurinol (15 mg/kg PO q12h), and then allopurinol alone for 8 months at the same dosage; 40 dogs (group 2) were treated with antimony alone according to the manufacturer's instructions (200 mg/kg SC q24h at 2-day intervals for 3-6 months); and 11 dogs (group 3) were treated with allopurinol alone (15 mg/kg PO q12h for 1-20 months). Information concerning signalment, history, physical examination findings, serologic testing and number of dogs becoming seronegative, outcome for each treated dog (clinical cure versus failure), and long-term survival were recorded. The numbers of the clinical cures versus failures were significantly different among the 3 groups (chi(2) = 17.77, P < .001), between groups 1 and 2 (chi(2) = 8.02, P < .01), between groups 2 and 3 (chi(2) = 11.00, P < .01), and between groups 1 and 3 (chi(2) = 16.52, P < .001). No significant difference between groups 1 and 2 was noted in the type of failure (relapse or death), serologic test results, and number of survival years (chi(2) = 2.79. P > .05). The results of the present study indicate that antimony in combination with allopurinol produces better results than antimony alone or allopurinol alone for the treatment of the canine leishmaniasis. With combination treatment, duration of treatment with antimony is shorter and long-term administration of allopurinol is well tolerated.",1999

Clinical signs of ephemeral fever occurred in four untreated cattle infected at the same time. Viraemia, the development of neutralizing antibodies (at 8-11 days), resistance to subsequent challenge with BEF virus, neutrophilia, lymphopenia and a rise in plasma fibrinogen occurred in all BEF-infected animals whether treated or untreated, despite different clinical appearances.

A total of 16 cattle was given phenylbutazone sodium (PBZ). The drug prevented fever and other clinical signs in six cattle when given daily during the incubation period, and at 8-h intervals for 5 days when clinical disease might be expected.

Clinical signs of ephemeral fever occurred in four untreated cattle infected at the same time. Viraemia, the development of neutralizing antibodies (at 8-11 days), resistance to subsequent challenge with BEF virus, neutrophilia, lymphopenia and a rise in plasma fibrinogen occurred in all BEF-infected animals whether treated or untreated, despite different clinical appearances. The mean peak of plasma fibrinogen in the untreated cattle was 6.9 g l-1; 3.2 g l-1 when treated 2-4 h after fever developed and 3.8 g l-1 when treated from 18-h post-infection.

Setting: Villages in Muzaffarpur district in India and Saptari, Sunsari, and Morang districts in Nepal. Participants: 13 intervention and 13 control clusters. 12691 people were included in the analysis of the main outcome (infection), and 19810 were enrolled for the secondary (disease) end point. Intervention: Longlasting insecticidal nets (treated with deltamethrin) were distributed in the intervention clusters in December 2006. Main outcome measures: Infection was determined by direct agglutination test at 12 and 24 months after the intervention in those who had negative results (titre <1:1600) at baseline. The effect estimate was computed as the geometric mean of the risk ratios for seroconversion for each cluster pair (net/no net), with its 95% confidence interval.

Results: There was no significant difference in the risk of seroconversion over 24 months in intervention (5.4%; 347/6372) compared with control (5.5%; 345/6319 people) clusters (risk ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 1.65) nor in the risk of clinical visceral leishmaniasis (0.99, 0.46 to 1.40).

Otranto","Prevention of feline leishmaniosis with an imidacloprid 10%/flumethrin 4.5% polymer matrix collar","Background: Leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is one of the most important vector-borne diseases affecting animals and humans worldwide. Dogs are considered main reservoirs of the zoonotic forms, though in the last years the role of cats as reservoirs has been increasingly investigated. Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) occurs in endemic areas and no specific preventive measures have been investigated so far. In this study the efficacy of a 10% imidacloprid/4.5% flumethrin polymer matrix collar, licensed for tick and flea prevention, has been assessed against FeL in a longitudinal study on 204 privately owned cats from the Aeolian islands (Sicily), an area highly endemic for the disease. From March to May 2015 [Study Day 0 (SD 0)], cats negative for FeL were collared (G1, n = 104) or left untreated (G2, n = 100). Diagnosis consisted of serology and qPCR on blood and conjunctival swabs, which were collected at baseline (SD 0) and at the end of the study (SD 360). Interim clinical examinations were performed on SD 210 (when collars were replaced in G1) and SD 270. Results: Of the 159 cats which completed the study, 5 in G1 and 20 in G2 were positive for L. infantum infection, in at least one of the diagnostic tests leading to a yearly crude incidence of 6.3% and 25.0% in G1 and G2, respectively (P = 0.0026). This translates into an efficacy of the collar of 75.0% in preventing feline Leishmania infection. The collar was generally well tolerated with no systemic adverse reactions and few local skin reactions were observed in the application area in four out of 104 treated cats (3.8%). Conclusions: The 10% imidacloprid/4.5% flumethrin collar significantly reduced the risk of L. infantum infection in cats. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which a preventative strategy against feline Leishmania infection is assessed under natural conditions.

Otranto","Prevention of feline leishmaniosis with an imidacloprid 10%/flumethrin 4.5% polymer matrix collar","Background: Leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is one of the most important vector-borne diseases affecting animals and humans worldwide. Dogs are considered main reservoirs of the zoonotic forms, though in the last years the role of cats as reservoirs has been increasingly investigated. Feline leishmaniosis (FeL) occurs in endemic areas and no specific preventive measures have been investigated so far. In this study the efficacy of a 10% imidacloprid/4.5% flumethrin polymer matrix collar, licensed for tick and flea prevention, has been assessed against FeL in a longitudinal study on 204 privately owned cats from the Aeolian islands (Sicily), an area highly endemic for the disease. From March to May 2015 [Study Day 0 (SD 0)], cats negative for FeL were collared (G1, n = 104) or left untreated (G2, n = 100). Diagnosis consisted of serology and qPCR on blood and conjunctival swabs, which were collected at baseline (SD 0) and at the end of the study (SD 360). Interim clinical examinations were performed on SD 210 (when collars were replaced in G1) and SD 270. Results: Of the 159 cats which completed the study, 5 in G1 and 20 in G2 were positive for L. infantum infection, in at least one of the diagnostic tests leading to a yearly crude incidence of 6.3% and 25.0% in G1 and G2, respectively (P = 0.0026). This translates into an efficacy of the collar of 75.0% in preventing feline Leishmania infection. The collar was generally well tolerated with no systemic adverse reactions and few local skin reactions were observed in the application area in four out of 104 treated cats (3.8%). Conclusions: The 10% imidacloprid/4.5% flumethrin collar significantly reduced the risk of L. infantum infection in cats. To our knowledge, this is the first study in which a preventative strategy against feline Leishmania infection is assessed under natural conditions.

These findings close a gap in veterinary medicine, in that they confirm this collar as a tool in reducing the risk of Leishmania infection in cats. Such a preventative tool could contribute to the reduction of the risk of the disease in animal and in human populations when included in integrated leishmaniosis control programmes. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017

Since the type of host immune response strongly influences CanL progression and prognosis, dogs could benefit from treatments targeted at modulating such response, such as nucleotides and active hexose correlated compound (AHCC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an oral combination of nucleotides and AHCC in dogs with clinical leishmaniosis. Sixty-nine dogs with naturally-occurring clinical leishmaniosis were included in this multicenter, open-label, positively-controlled clinical trial and randomized to receive 10 mg/kg allopurinol PO BID (allopurinol group) or 17 mg/kg AHCC plus 32 mg/kg nucleotides PO SID (supplement group) for 180 days. All dogs were also given 50 mg/kg MGA SC BID during the first 28 days. At the time points 0, 30, and 180 days of the trial, dogs underwent a clinical examination, and blood, urine, and bone marrow samples were submitted for analytical tests. Final data analyses (allopurinol group: n = 29; supplement group: n = 24) revealed a significant improvement in both groups in clinical scores and ELISA-determined antibody titers after treatment. However, the supplement group showed a significantly lower clinical score (P = 0.005) and significantly higher antibody titers (P = 0.032) after 180 days, compared to the allopurinol group. RT-PCR parasite loads were reduced in groups (mean ± SD supplement: 0.38 ± 0.56 vs 5.23 ± 18.9; allopurinol: 0.45 ± 1.47 vs 3.09 ± 8.36 parasites/ng of DNA), but there were no significant differences over time or between groups. During the study, 12 dogs in the allopurinol group developed xanthinuria (41%) compared to no dogs (0%) in the supplement group (P = 0.000). Both treatments led to significantly increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and improvements in protein electrophoretic pattern and acute phase response. In conclusion, 6-month oral treatment with nucleotides and AHCC in addition to MGA showed similar efficacy to the current first-line treatment for CanL, without producing xanthinuria. This combination could be a good alternative to MGA-allopurinol combination treatment for CanL, especially for dogs suffering allopurinol-related adverse events. © 2017 The Author(s)",2017

However, in some dogs allopurinol may induce hyperxanthinuria leading to urolithiasis. Moreover, allopurinol resistance has recently been described in Leishmania infantum isolates from treated dogs with a relapse of the disease. Alternative treatments are thus needed. Since the type of host immune response strongly influences CanL progression and prognosis, dogs could benefit from treatments targeted at modulating such response, such as nucleotides and active hexose correlated compound (AHCC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of an oral combination of nucleotides and AHCC in dogs with clinical leishmaniosis. Sixty-nine dogs with naturally-occurring clinical leishmaniosis were included in this multicenter, open-label, positively-controlled clinical trial and randomized to receive 10 mg/kg allopurinol PO BID (allopurinol group) or 17 mg/kg AHCC plus 32 mg/kg nucleotides PO SID (supplement group) for 180 days. All dogs were also given 50 mg/kg MGA SC BID during the first 28 days. At the time points 0, 30, and 180 days of the trial, dogs underwent a clinical examination, and blood, urine, and bone marrow samples were submitted for analytical tests. Final data analyses (allopurinol group: n = 29; supplement group: n = 24) revealed a significant improvement in both groups in clinical scores and ELISA-determined antibody titers after treatment. However, the supplement group showed a significantly lower clinical score (P = 0.005) and significantly higher antibody titers (P = 0.032) after 180 days, compared to the allopurinol group. RT-PCR parasite loads were reduced in groups (mean ± SD supplement: 0.38 ± 0.56 vs 5.23 ± 18.9; allopurinol: 0.45 ± 1.47 vs 3.09 ± 8.36 parasites/ng of DNA), but there were no significant differences over time or between groups. During the study, 12 dogs in the allopurinol group developed xanthinuria (41%) compared to no dogs (0%) in the supplement group (P = 0.000). Both treatments led to significantly increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and improvements in protein electrophoretic pattern and acute phase response. In conclusion, 6-month oral treatment with nucleotides and AHCC in addition to MGA showed similar efficacy to the current first-line treatment for CanL, without producing xanthinuria.

Initially, 72 clinically healthy owned dogs were sampled for inclusion. Ten out of the 72 (13.8%) were seropositive according to the Snap Leish® ELISA test and removed. Ultimately, a total of 56 dogs were followed from May to October 2015 with monthly blood samples and serological tests based on Snap Leish® and Snap 4Dx® ELISA tests. Twenty-five dogs were treated with deltamethrin collar (Scalibor®) (Group 1) and 31 were treated monthly with the topical fipronil/permethrin formulation (Group 2). In group 1, three dogs out of 25 (12%) seroconverted for Leishmania whereas none of the dogs (0/31) seroconverted in group 2. In addition, this trial provided means to serological assess the transmission of other vector-borne pathogens. Regarding Anaplasma spp., one dog in each group was seropositive at the beginning of the study and no dogs became positive during the study. For Ehrlichia canis, 9/25 (36%) dogs in group 1 and 5/31 (16.1%) in group 2 were seropositive at inclusion time. Two out of 16 (11.8%) and 3/26 (11.5%) dogs became positive for E. canis after 3 months in groups 1 and 2, respectively.

Dogs were clients to 17 veterinary practices and were analyzed for Leishmania infantum antibodies in blood plasma using two commercial ELISAs (Ingezim, Ingenasa®, Spain; Leishcan, Hipra®, Spain). Owners were interviewed to gather data on dog related variables. They included date of birth, home address and frequency, duration and timing of insecticide treatments used to prevent ectoparasite infestations. The dog's residence was georeferenced and environmental data potentially associated with the dog's risk of L. infantum infection was obtained. A mixed logistic regression model was then developed to analyze the relationship between the dog's serological status and insecticidal treatment adjusted for demographic and environmental variables.

At least 16 different insecticide products were used and 73%, 26% and 1% of dogs received 1, 2 and 3 products a year. The most frequent commercial brands used and the only ones in the market claiming anti-sandfly activity, were Scalibor collars (deltametrin 40mg/g; MSD®), Advantix pipettes (permethrin 500mg/ml and imidacloprid 100mg/ml; Bayer®) and Exspot spot-on pipettes (permethrin 715mg/ml; MSD®). Seroprevalence was 9%, 16%, 20%, 22% and 25% for dogs with Scalibor collars plus Advantix pipettes, Scalibor collars plus ExSpot pipettes, Advantix pipettes alone, Scalibor collars alone and Exspot pipettes alone, respectively. The multivariable model confirmed a significant reduction in the risk of Leishmania spp. seropositivity in dogs using the Scalibor and Advantix combination compared to those using either product alone and provided evidence of greatly increased risk of CanL in rural areas situated at 300-500m altitude and average March-July temperatures of 18.6-19°C. The study highlights the difficulty in controlling CanL infection by means of insecticide use alone and that it could be improved by using the Scalibor and Advantix combination and identifying and targeting specific geographical areas. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..",2016

The in vitro activity of this fluoroquinolone was assessed using two different methods: a direct test aimed at assessing the drug activity on the parasite, and an indirect test aimed at evaluating the drug effect on macrophage killing, lymphomonocyte activation and nitric oxide production. An in vivo test was also performed on 36 dogs with leishmaniasis, subdivided into three groups, one treated with enrofloxacin, another with enrofloxacin plus metronidazole, and a control group with meglumine antimoniate. The direct test did not show any action of enrofloxacin on the parasite, while the indirect testing showed an enhancement of macrophage killing and an increase in nitric oxide production. These findings show that enrofloxacin does not exert a direct anti-leishmanial activity in vitro. However, on the basis of the positive immunostimulation results shown in vitro and the clinical improvement, particularly of the cutaneous lesions, obtained in several dogs in the in vivo trial, the use of enrofloxacin in association with a specific anti-leishmanial drug can be proposed in the therapeutic protocol of canine leishmaniasis. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",2004

The aim of the study was to identify the minimum total dose of liposomal amphotericin B needed to cure the infection in children and reduce the period of hospitalization. We conclude that the optimal regimen in immunocompetent children with L. infantum visceral leishmaniasis to be a total dose of 18 mg/kg of liposomal amphotericin B (3 mg/kg per day for 5 days, followed by 3 mg/kg administered as an outpatient regimen on day 10).",1997
