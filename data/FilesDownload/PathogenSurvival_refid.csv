Pools of 24 uninfected Culex pipiens L. mosquitoes were ""spiked"" with either a single Cx. pipiens that had been inoculated previously with WN virus or with an uninfected mosquito. These pools were held dry at 20,4, -20, or - 70degreesC for selected time intervals before all mosquito pools were triturated in TRIzol(R)LS reagent and processed for detection of WN viral RNA. While infectious virus virtually disappeared from pools maintained at 20degreesC by 48 h after mosquito death, neither holding temperature (20 to -70degreesC) nor holding period (up to 2 wk) affected detection of WN viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR. These findings suggest that we need not keep mosquitoes chilled to be able to detect WN viral RNA effectively by RT-PCR. This should enhance the feasibility of field-based WN virus surveillance programs where only detection of WN viral RNA is the objective and maintenance of a cold chain may not be possible.","2002"

Wilkinson","Recovery and assay of African swine fever and swine vesicular disease viruses from pig slurry","Assaying samples for infectious virus is more difficult when the sample is toxic to cells used in the assay, e.g. with samples of infected pig slurry. Various techniques were compared for the recovery of African swine fever virus (ASFV) and swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV) in pig slurry. Extraction with Freon led to 80-100% recovery of SVDV added to pig slurry. The assay sensitivity enabled undiluted, centrifuged sample to be put directly onto monolayers of IB-RS2 cells, allowing a minimum detection level of 10(0.7) pfu ml(-1) ASFV was difficult to recover intact, and the best technique allowed a recovery of 60% with a minimum detectable level of 10(1.8) HAD(50) ml(-1), due to toxicity to the cells at low sample dilutions. Extraction with the addition of an equal volume of ox serum to inoculated slurry was best at recovering ASFV. Poor recoveries with the other techniques may have been due to the inactivation of the virus while in the slurry rather than as a result of the inability of the method to extract ASFV.","1999"

Specific nested PCR products were detected in both frozen and formalin-fixed samples from the Australian sheep after storage for 3.5 years. The tissues from sheep inoculated with the North American serotypes yielded specific nested PCR products after storage at - 70 degrees C for 14 years. No specific primary PCR products were detected in any frozen or formalin-fixed samples.

Hofmeister","Potential for waterborne and invertebrate transmission of West Nile virus in the Great Salt Lake, Utah","In November and December of 2013, a large mortality event involving 15,000 to 20,000 eared grebes (Podiceps nigricollis) occurred at the Great Salt Lake (GSL), UT. The onset of the outbreak in grebes was followed by a mortality event in >86 bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). During the die-off, West Nile virus (WNV) was detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) or viral culture in the carcasses of grebes and eagles submitted to the National Wildlife Health Center. However, no activity of mosquitoes, the primary vectors of WNV, was detected by the State of Utah's WNV monitoring program. The transmission of WNV has rarely been reported during the winter in North America in the absence of known mosquito activity; however, the size of this die-off, the habitat in which it occurred, and the species involved are unique. We experimentally investigated whether WNV could survive in water with a high salt content, as found at the GSL, and whether brine shrimp, the primary food of migrating eared grebes on the GSL, could have played a role in the transmission of WNV to feeding birds. We found that WNV can survive up to 72 h at 4°C in water containing 30 to 150 ppt NaCl, and brine shrimp incubated with WNV in 30 ppt NaCl may adsorb WNV to their cuticle and, through feeding, infect epithelial cells of their gut. Both mechanisms may have potentiated the WNV die-off in migrating eared grebes on the GSL. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.","2017"

The shedding of ASFV by infected pigs and the stability of ASFV in the environment will determine the extent of environmental contamination. The recent outbreaks of ASF in Europe make it essential to develop disease transmission models in order to design effective control strategies to prevent further spread of ASF. In this study, we assessed the shedding and stability of ASFV in faeces, urine and oral fluid from pigs infected with the Georgia 2007/1 ASFV isolate. The half-life of infectious ASFV in faeces was found to range from 0.65 days when stored at 4°C to 0.29 days when stored at 37°C, while in urine it was found to range from 2.19 days (4°C) to 0.41 days (37°C). Based on these half-lives and the estimated dose required for infection, faeces and urine would be estimated to remain infectious for 8.48 and 15.33 days at 4°C and 3.71 and 2.88 days at 37°C, respectively. The half-life of ASFV DNA was 8 to 9 days in faeces and 2 to 3 days in oral fluid at all temperatures. In urine, the half-life of ASFV DNA was found to be 32.54 days at 4°C decreasing to 19.48 days at 37°C.

A variety of preserved food, such as corned beef, canned meat, bacon, etc., is made of pork products and by-products. Persistence of the virus in these products is not fully understood. For the first time we carried out studies on infectious activity of ASF virus isolates circulating in the Russian Federation, in contaminated pig products, feed, as well as in samples intended for veterinary-sanitary supervision. For this purpose, the 3-4 month-old piglets of 20-30 kg body weight were intramuscularly challenged with virus-containing blood. For inoculation we used ASFV isolate Volgograd-Kalach 2012 with the initial infectious titer of 7.5 lg HAU50/cm3 obtained from the National Collection of the SSINRRIVV&amp;M of RAAS. Three days after infection the animals were slaughtered, samples of internal organs and tissues were taken for virus isolation, and the pork was used for making corned beef, canned meat and salted lard. Blood, containing ASF virus, was also used for contamination of a compound feed and drinking water. To study effects of storage temperature on the virus infectious activity and genome detection, the samples were divided into aliquots and stored at 20-25 °C. (room temperature), 4-6 °C. (a common refrigerator); -16<U+22EF>-20 °C. (freezer). The temperatures selected for the storage of samples conform to the natural weather conditions at various seasons (20-25 °C. in the summer, -16<U+22EF>-20 °C. in winter); 4-6 °C. isolation was carried out in a primary culture of swine bone marrow cells for 5 days in two consecutive passages. Hemadsorption test (HAD) and real-time PCR were conducted for ASFV titer estimation and genome detection. As a result, the ASF virus was found in corned beef and lard stored at 20-25 °C. for 16 days. At storage temperature of 4-6 °C. the ASF virus was revealed in corned beef during the observation period (60 days). In frozen samples the ASFV infectious activity and DNA fragments were found throughout the entire study period (60 days). Thus, it is found that in food products and by-products from pigs slaughtered soon after ASF infecting the ASFV infectivity persists for a long time depending on the storage conditions and can pose a serious danger as a pathogen transmission factor. The data also allow to predict the temperature conditions conducive to maintaining circulation of the virus in.SF outbreaks.","2016"

Weesendorp, S. Quak, J.A. Stegeman, W.L.A. Loeffen","Suitability of faeces and tissue samples as a basis for non-invasive sampling for African swine fever in wild boar","A challenging aspect of ASFV control in wild boar populations is the design and implementation of effective surveillance and monitoring programmes, both for early warning, and to determine the ongoing epidemiological situation in an infected population. Testing blood samples requires invasive sampling strategies like hunting or capture of wild boar. Besides being biased towards healthy animals, such strategies are also linked to further spread of the virus. Non-invasive sampling strategies would increase the reliability of surveillance of ASFV in wild boar populations, without the negative side effects. This study evaluates the potential of faeces and tissue samples as a basis for non-invasive sampling strategies for ASFV in wild boar. In the acute phase (0-21 days after infection), in comparison with virus detection in blood, virus can be detected in faeces 50-80% of the time. This percentage decreases to below 10% for the subacute/chronic phase. ASFV DNA is quite stable in faeces. Half-lives range from more than 2 years at temperature up to 12. °C, to roughly 15 days at temperatures of 30. °C. In tissue samples, stored at 20. °C, half-lives mostly range from 1.7 to 7.4 days. The sample of preference is the spleen, where the highest titres and highest half-life of ASFV DNA are observed. The level and duration of excretion of ASFV in the faeces, combined with the stability of the DNA, suggest that sampling of faeces could be the basis for a non-invasive sampling strategy to monitor ASFV in wild boar. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","2014"

In this study, the survival of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in suspension and dried on surfaces was analyzed. In addition, the sensitivity of VSV to disinfectants and physicochemical changes was investigated. VSV showed a notable stability in suspension at 4 °C with virus titers remaining high over several weeks. The presence of serum proteins had a stabilizing effect on virus infectivity, whereas elevated temperatures reduced survival times. VSV dried on polystyrene, glass or stainless steel surfaces remained infectious for at least 6 days at ambient temperature. VSV showed a remarkable resistance to extreme pH in particular in the alkaline range, but could be rapidly inactivated by heating at 55 °C or higher. The virus was highly sensitive to inactivation by commonly used disinfectants such as aldehydes, alcohols, and detergents. The high stability of VSV on surfaces and in suspension may facilitate dissemination of the virus in livestock by contaminated feeding and water troughs, hands, and milking equipment. This knowledge on the sensitivity of VSV to disinfectants will help to set up appropriate hygiene measures. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","2013"

Derner","Infection of Melanoplus sanguinipes grasshoppers following ingestion of rangeland plant species harboring vesicular stomatitis virus","Knowledge of the many mechanisms of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) transmission is critical for understanding of the epidemiology of sporadic disease outbreaks in the western United States. Migratory grasshoppers [Melanoplus sanguinipes (Fabricius)] have been implicated as reservoirs and mechanical vectors of VSV. The grasshopper-cattle-grasshopper transmission cycle is based on the assumptions that (i) virus shed from clinically infected animals would contaminate pasture plants and remain infectious on plant surfaces and (ii) grasshoppers would become infected by eating the virus-contaminated plants. Our objectives were to determine the stability of VSV on common plant species of U.S. Northern Plains rangelands and to assess the potential of these plant species as a source of virus for grasshoppers. Fourteen plant species were exposed to VSV and assayed for infectious virus over time (0 to 24 h). The frequency of viable virus recovery at 24 h postexposure was as high as 73%. The two most common plant species in Northern Plains rangelands (western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii] and needle and thread [Hesperostipa comata]) were fed to groups of grasshoppers. At 3 weeks postfeeding, the grasshopper infection rate was 44 to 50%. Exposure of VSV to a commonly used grasshopper pesticide resulted in complete viral inactivation. This is the first report demonstrating the stability of VSV on rangeland plant surfaces, and it suggests that a significant window of opportunity exists for grasshoppers to ingest VSV from contaminated plants. The use of grasshopper pesticides on pastures would decrease the incidence of a virus-amplifying mechanical vector and might also decontaminate pastures, thereby decreasing the inter- and intraherd spread of VSV.

This raised concerns about the safety of plasma derivatives. To verify the safety margins of these products, which were initially shown with a panel of model viruses including some very similar to WNV, the effectiveness of the virus inactivation procedures incorporated into their manufacturing processes was reinvestigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An infectivity assay for 1999 New York isolate of WNV was established to investigate virus inactivation steps commonly used during the manufacture of plasma derivatives, such as pasteurization for human albumin, S/D treatment for IVIG and FVIII, vapor heating for FVIII inhibitor-bypassing activity, and incubation at low pH for IVIG. RESULTS: The results show that WNV behaves exactly as had been predicted based on available data for similar model viruses; that is, it is readily inactivated by all the commonly used virus inactivation procedures tested. CONCLUSION: Our investigation verifies the safety margins of plasma derivatives against a potential transmission of WNV and that the model virus concept is valid for predicting the behavior of closely related viruses.","2003"

A potentially prospective approach to reducing the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections of a known or newly emerging microbe is implementation of a broad-spectrum pathogen reduction technology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of WNV to PEN110 inactivation in RBCs and to characterize the WNV interaction with blood, including the stability of WNV in RBCs stored at 1 to 6°C, its distribution and infectivity, and its ability to infect WBCs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Inactivation was performed with three WNV isolates spiked into WBC-reduced RBCs. The stability of the virus was evaluated by spiking two viral loads into RBCs followed by storing at 1 to 6°C for up to 42 days. The distribution of the virus in plasma, RBCs, and PBMCs was evaluated with whole blood from infected hamsters. Finally, in vitro propagation of WNV was evaluated with the THP-1 cell line and primary monocytes. RESULTS: The kinetics of PEN110 inactivation of WNV isolates RI-44, NJ-176, and 99-3494031 were fast and complete within 24 hours with reduction factors of 5 to 7 log plaque-forming units per mL. WNV remained infectious for up to 42 days at 1 to 6°C. The WNV titers in whole blood, plasma, RBCs, and PBMC fractions were equally distributed and ranged from 2 to 3 log tissue culture infectious dose 50 percent per mL. Productive infection of stimulated monocytes and THP-1 cells was also demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrated that PEN110 efficiently inactivated WNV in RBCs and whole blood from infected hamsters to the limit of detection. WNV survived in RBCs stored at 1 to 6°C with a gradual loss of titer but infectivity could still be observed for up to 42 days. In addition, it was observed that WNV was equally distributed in all blood fractions including PBMCs and it was possible to establish productive infection of a human monocytic cell line and stimulated human monocytes.","2003"

Under these conditions, the virus decayed more rapidly at 60% RH than at 30% RH (decay rates of 40%/min vs 25%/min, respectively). Although both pollutant and light were toxic when employed separately, the viral response to a combination of the two was much greater than the sum of the separate effects, suggesting that an interaction had occurred. Lowering the light intensity to 40 meal cm-2 min-1 produced a similar although decreased effect at 60% RH, At 30% RH, however, the SO2-light combined effect was not found; in this case, SO2 alone effected viral inactivation to a significantly greater degree than either light alone or the SO2-light combination.

Limited knowledge exists on the interactions between avian influenza viruses (AIV) and the environmental factors associated with poultry farms. To improve our existing understanding of AIV survival in various environmental conditions, experiments were conducted to investigate the persistence of AIV in reused poultry litter. Additionally, we investigated the effects of a litter acidifier, based on sodium bisulfate, as well as different composting temperatures on the survivability of this virus. The highly pathogenic AIV was found to persist much longer than low pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) in litter material, regardless of the number of cycles the litter was used. No clear association was detected between litter cycle use and viral persistence. In terms of litter acidification, the acidifier amendment immediately inactivated LPAIV when directly mixed with the virus and in the presence of broiler litter. Differing results were obtained in turkey litter where the virus persisted less than 48 h. Finally, when testing composting temperatures, LPAIV was inactivated in litter after 30 min of viral contamination but before the target temperatures were reached. In carcass material with and without litter, LPAIV survived for less than 30 min, before reaching 50°C or 60°C, showing a detrimental effect on LPAIV survivability.

During winter 2015-2016, several cases of infection caused by highly pathogenic (HP) AIVs belonging to the A/H5N1, A/H5N2, and A/H5N9 subtypes were detected in southwestern France. Throughout winter 2016-2017, several cases of infections caused mainly by A/H5N8 HP AIV (A/goose/GD/1/1996, clade 2.3.4.4) were detected across Europe. On both occasions, the viruses were widely detected on palmiped farms in France. This study was designed to evaluate the persistence of A/H5 HP AIV in slurry from various duck productions. This was achieved (i) in the laboratory setting by artificially spiking four AIV-free slurry samples with known amounts of A/H5N9 HP AIV and monitoring virus infectivity, with or without lime treatment to achieve pH 10 or pH 12, and (ii) by sampling slurry tanks on five naturally A/H5N8 HP-contaminated farms. Experimental results in artificially spiked slurry suggested virus survival for 4 weeks in slurry from Muscovy or Pekin duck breeders and for 2 weeks in slurry from ducks for foie gras production during the assisted-feeding period, without lime treatment. Persistence of infectious A/H5N9 HP AIV in all slurry samples after lime treatment at pH 10 or pH 12 was less than 1 week. The A/H5N8 HP AIV persisted in naturally contaminated untreated slurry for 7 weeks. The results obtained provide experimental support for the 60-day storage period without treatment or the 7-day interval after lime treatment defined in French regulations for slurry sanitization. IMPORTANCE From November 2015 to July 2017, two successive episodes of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HP AIVs) infections occurred on poultry farms in France, mostly in domestic ducks raised for foie gras production in southwestern France. During the two epizootics, epidemiological investigations were carried out on infected farms and control and biosafety measures were implemented in association with surveillance in order to stop the spread of the viruses. Effluents are known to be an important factor in environmental dissemination of viruses, and suitable effluent management is needed to help prevent the spread of epizootics to other farms or pathogen persistence at the farm level. The present study was therefore designed to assess how long infectious A/H5 HP AIVs can persist in naturally or experimentally contaminated fecal slurry samples from ducks, with or without sanitization by lime treatment. © 2020 Schmitz et al.","2020"

These birds help in the spread of the virus among the poultry and human population through direct or indirect contact. Preen oil is the secretion of preen gland of water birds such as ducks. In a process called preening, the water birds spread preen oil across their feather and body. Preen oil has been known to play a significant role in the accumulation of various pathogens including Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) from water onto feathers. However, the studies are scarce on the role of preen oil in the survivability of HPAIV. We conducted a simulative study to analyse the effect of preen oil on the survivability of the HPAI virus (H5N1) on duck feathers. Duck feather samples along with relevant controls were spiked with the H5N1 virus at two different initial concentrations (104 EID50 and 106 EID50), stored at 37°C, 25°C and 10°C temperatures and tested at regular intervals for percent infectivity by egg culture method and qRT-PCR. The infectivity and viral load were significantly higher in naturally preened duck feathers in comparison to the three preen oil deficit controls at both low and high initial concentrations of virus (104 EID50 and 106 EID50). Maximum persistence was seen at 10°C in naturally preened duck feathers spiked with 106 EID50 concentration of viruses. It was also seen that depletion of preen oil from duck feathers reduced the persistence of the virus. These results demonstrate that preen oil plays a significant role in survivability and protection of HPAIV on duck feathers.

Because AIV is not environmentally stable, heating poultry houses may provide an alternative disinfection method. The objective was to determine the time necessary to inactivate AIV in poultry litter at temperatures achievable in a poultry house. Low pathogenic (LP) AIV inactivation was evaluated between 10.0°–48.9 °C, at ~5.5 °C intervals and highly pathogenic (HP) AIV inactivation was evaluated between 10.0°–43.3 °C, at ~11 °C intervals. Samples were collected at numerous time points for each temperature. Virus isolation in embryonating chicken eggs was conducted to determine if viable virus was present. Each sample was also tested by real-time RT-PCR. Low pathogenicity AIV was inactivated at 1 day at 26.7 °C or above. At 10.0, 15.6 and 21.1 °C, inactivation times increased to 2–5 days. Highly pathogenic AIV followed a similar trend; the virus was inactivated after 1 day at 43.3 °C and 32.2 °C, and required 2 and 5 days for inactivation at 21.1 °C and 10.0 °C respectively. While low pathogenicity AIV appeared to be inactivated at a lower temperature than high pathogenicity AIV, this was not due to any difference in the strains, but due to fewer temperature points being evaluated for high pathogenicity. Endpoints for detection by real-time RT-PCR were not found even weeks after the virus was inactivated. This provides a guideline for the time required, at specific temperatures to inactivate AIV in poultry litter and likely on surfaces within the house. Heat treatment will provide an added level of safety to personnel and against further spread by eliminating infectious virus prior to cleaning a house. © 2017","2017"

The tissues were stored at +4°C or +20°C, and viral isolation was performed at different times for 360 days. The maximum periods for viral survival were observed in samples stored at +4°C in all tissue types and were 240 days in feather tissues, 160 days in muscle, and 20 days in liver. The viral infectivity at +20°C was maintained for a maximum of 30 days in the feather tissues, 20 days in muscle, and 3 days in liver. The viral inactivation rates partly overlapped in the feather and muscle tissues at the two temperatures. The virus was inactivated rapidly in the liver.

In laboratory-based studies, LPAI viruses can remain infective for extended durations (months) in water, but the persistence is strongly dependent on water conditions (temperature, salinity, pH) and virus strain. Little is known about the stability of H5N1 HPAI viruses in water. With the use of an established laboratory model system, the persistence of 11 strains of H5N1 HPAI virus was measured in buffered distilled water (pH 7.2) at two temperatures (17 and 28 C) and three salinities (0, 15,000, and 30,000 ppm). There was extensive variation between the 11 H5N1 HPAI virus strains in the overall stability in water, with a range similar to that which has been reported for wild-bird-origin LPAI viruses. The H5N1 HPAI virus strains responded similarly to different water temperatures and salinities, with all viruses being most stable at colder temperatures and fresh to brackish salinities. These results indicate that the overall stability and response of H5N1 HPAI viruses in water is similar to LPAI viruses, and suggest there has been no increase or loss of environmental survivability in H5N1 HPAI viruses. © American Association of Avian Pathologists.","2014"

Methodology/Principal Findings: The survival of HPAI H5N1 viruses in experimental aquatic biotopes (water, mud, aquatic flora and fauna) relevant to field conditions in Cambodia was investigated. Artificial aquatic biotopes, including simple ones containing only mud and water, and complex biotopes involving the presence of aquatic flora and fauna, were set up. They were experimentally contaminated with H5N1 virus. The persistence of HPAI H5N1 virus (local avian and human isolates) was determined by virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs and by real-time reverse-polymerase chain reaction. Persistence of infectious virus did not exceed 4 days, and was only identified in rain water. No infectious virus particles were detected in pond and lake water or mud even when high inoculum doses were used. However, viral RNA persisted up to 20 days in rain water and 7 days in pond or lake water. Viral RNA was also detected in mud samples, up to 14 days post-contamination in several cases. Infectious virus and viral RNA was detected in few cases in the aquatic fauna and flora, especially in bivalves and labyrinth fish, although these organisms seemed to be mostly passive carriers of the virus rather than host allowing virus replication. Conclusions/Significance: Although several factors for the survival and persistence of HPAI viruses in the environment are still to be elucidated, and are particularly hard to control in laboratory conditions, our results, along with previous data, support the idea that environmental surveillance is of major relevance for avian influenza control programs. © 2012 Horm et al.

Test coupons were inoculated with the virus and exposed to one of five environmental conditions that included changes in temperature, relative humidity, and simulated sunlight. At time periods up to 13 days, the virus was extracted from each coupon, and quantified via cytopathic effects on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.

Rapid identification of infectious individuals or animals is crucial not only for avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance programmes, but also for treatment and containment strategies. This study used a combination of quantitative real-time RT-PCR with an internal positive control and a cell-titration system to examine the presence of virus in different samples during active experimental AIV infection and its persistence in the infected carcasses. Oropharyngeal/cloacal swabs as well as feather pulp and blood samples were collected from 15-day-old chicks infected with H7N1 highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) and the kinetics of virus shedding during active infection were evaluated. Additionally, several samples (muscle, skin, brain, feather pulp and oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs) were examined to assess the persistence of virus in the HPAIV-infected carcasses. Based on the results, feather pulp was found to be the best sample to detect and isolate HPAIV from infected chicks from 24 h after inoculation onwards. Kinetic studies on the persistence of virus in infected carcasses revealed that tissues such as muscle could potentially transmit infectious virus for 3 days post-mortem (p.m.), whilst other tissues such as skin, feather pulp and brain retained their infectivity for as long as 5-6 days p.m. at environmental temperature (22-23 °C). These results strongly favour feather as a useful sample for HPAIV diagnosis in infected chickens as well as in carcasses. © 2010 SGM.","2010"

However, little is known about its persistence in contaminated tissues derived from infected birds. We investigated avian influenza virus (H5N1) persistence in feathers detached from bodies of infected ducks to evaluate their potential risk for environmental contamination. Four-week-old domestic ducks were inoculated with different clades of avian influenza virus (H5N1). Feathers, drinking water, and feces were collected on day 3 postinoculation and stored at 4°C or 20°C. Viral persistence in samples was investigated for 360 days by virus isolation and reverse transcription-PCR. Infectious viruses persisted for the longest period in feathers, compared with drinking water and feces, at both 4°C and 20°C. Viral infectivity persisted in the feathers for 160 days at 4°C and for IS days at 20°C. Viral titers of 104.3 50% egg infectious doses/ml or greater were detected for 120 days in feathers stored at 4°C. Viral RNA in feathers was more stable than the infectivity. These results indicate that feathers detached from domestic ducks infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) can be a source of environmental contamination and may function as fomites with high viral loads in the environment.

Recently, these viruses rarely infected humans but had a high mortality rate in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Egypt. Thereby, these viruses caused high economic costs for production of poultry and health protection. We inactivated a highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus of subtype H7N7 in cell culture medium and chicken meat by heat and high hydrostatic pressure. Because heat and pressure inactivation curves of the H7N7 virus showed deviations from first-order kinetics, a reaction order of 1.1 had to be selected. A mathematical inactivation model has been developed that is valid between 10 and 60°C and up to 500 MPa, allowing the prediction of the reduction in virus titer in response to pressure, temperature, and treatment time. Incubation at 63°C for 2 min and 500 MPa at 15°C for 15 s inactivated more than 105 PFU/ml, respectively.

However, simplifying assumptions and excessive use of proxy measures to compensate for gaps in available data may compromise modeled outcomes. The current investigation was prospectively designed to address two major gaps in current knowledge of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) pathogenesis in pigs: the end (duration) of the infectious period and the viability of FMDV in decaying carcasses. By serial exposure of sentinel groups of pigs to the same group of donor pigs infected by FMDV A24 Cruzeiro, it was demonstrated that infected pigs transmitted disease at 10 days post infection (dpi), but not at 15 dpi. Assuming a latent period of 1 day, this would result in a conservative estimate of an infectious duration of 9 days, which is considerably longer than suggested by a previous report from an experiment performed in cattle. Airborne contagion was diminished within two days of removal of infected pigs from isolation rooms. FMDV in muscle was inactivated within 7 days in carcasses stored at 4oC. By contrast, FMDV infectivity in vesicle epithelium harvested from intact carcasses stored under similar conditions remained remarkably high until the study termination at 11 weeks post mortem. The output from this study consists of experimentally determined data on contagion associated with FMDV-infected pigs. This information may be utilized to update parameterization of models used for foot-and-mouth disease outbreak simulations involving areas of substantial pig production. © Copyright © 2020 Stenfeldt, Bertram, Smoliga, Hartwig, Delgado and Arzt.","2020"

Inadequate storage methods lead to spoilage of FMDV samples collected from clinically positive animals in the field. Such samples are declared as non-typeable by the typing laboratories with the consequent loss of valuable epidemiological data. In this study, an attempt was made to evaluate the robustness of Flinders Technology Associates (FTA) cards for storage and transportation of FMDV samples in different climatic conditions which will be useful for FMDV surveillance. Simulation transport studies were conducted using FTA impregnated FMDV samples during post-monsoon (September–October 2010) and summer season (May–June 2012). FMDV genome or serotype could be identified from the FTA cards after the simulation transport studies with varying temperature (22–45°C) and relative humidity (20–100%). The stability of the viral RNA, the absence of infectivity and ease of processing the sample for molecular methods make the FTA cards an useful option for transport of FMDV genome for identification and type determination. The method can be used routinely for FMDV research as it is economical and the cards can be transported easily in envelopes by regular courier/postal systems. The absence of live virus in FTA card can be viewed as an advantage as it restricts the risk of transmission of live virus. © 2015 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","2016"

The fleeces of 3 of the sheep were contaminated with FMDV at 2 days post exposure (dpe), while at 5 dpe the fleeces of all 5 sheep were more extensively, and more heavily, contaminated. The persistence of FMDV on contaminated wool was examined in vitro using multiple 0.5 g samples of Merino wool that were each contaminated with one of 3 strains of FMDV in tissue-culture medium: O1-BFS, O-Morocco (O-MOR 9/91) or an Asia 1 strain (TAI 1/90). Wool samples were held at either 4°C, 18°C or 37°C, and decay curves were established for each virus at each temperature. These curves predicted that O1-BFS, O-MOR 9/91 and TAI 1/90 would fall below detect-able levels at 72, 70 and 48 days post contamination (pc), respectively, for wool stored at 4°C; at 11, 12 and 12 days pc, respectively, for wool stored at 18°C; and at 57, 68 and 33 hours pc, respectively, for wool stored at 37°C. For wool contaminated with O1-BFS-infected sheep faeces, urine or blood, or with O1-BFS-infected cattle saliva, decay curves predicted virus to persist for 5 to 11 days pc at 18°C. We demonstrated that the simulated scouring of FMDV-contaminated wool at 60° to 70°C would usually reduce virus to below detectable levels. The detergent component of the scouring process had little, if any, antiviral activity, and scouring at 20°C or 50°C had limited impact on FMDV titres. We recommend that either (1) simple storage of FMDV-contaminated wool for 4 weeks at temperatures of 18°C or higher, or (2) scouring of contaminated wool at 60° to 70°C would be sufficient to remove the threat of FMDV-contaminated wool being infectious to other animals.

Assessment of the disease risks associated with material of porcine origin requires knowledge on the likely amount of virus in the original material, how long the virus may remain viable within the resulting product and how much of that product would need to be ingested to result in infection. Using material from pigs infected with CSFV, we determined the viable virus concentrations in tissues that comprise the majority of pork products. Decimal reduction values (D values), the time required to reduce the viable virus load by 90% (or 1log10), were determined at temperatures of relevance for chilling, cooking, composting and ambient storage. The rate of CSFV inactivation varied in different tissues. At lower temperatures, virus remained viable for substantially longer in muscle and serum compared to lymphoid and fat tissues. To enable estimation of the temperature dependence of inactivation, the temperature change required to change the D values by 90% (Z values) were determined as 13°C, 14°C, 12°C and 10°C for lymph node, fat, muscle and serum, respectively. The amount of virus required to infect 50% of pigs by ingestion was determined by feeding groups of animals with moderately and highly virulent CSFV. Interestingly, the virulent virus did not initiate infection at a lower dose than the moderately virulent strain. Although higher than for intranasal inoculation, the amount of virus required for infection via ingestion is present in only a few grams of tissue from infected animals. © 2015 .","2015"

A prerequisite for indirect transmission is survival of the virus on the mechanical vector. Consequently, to obtain more insight into these transmission routes, it is important to know how long the virus remains viable outside the host. In this study we examined the survival of classical swine fever virus in faeces and urine derived from pigs intranasally inoculated with a highly or moderately virulent CSFV strain. Faeces and urine were collected between days 5 and 36 post-inoculation, and stored at 5, 12, 20, and 30 °C. Next, the virus titres were determined in the samples by virus titration, and a random selection of these samples was also analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRRT-PCR) to determine the viral RNA decay. Survival curves were generated, and it was shown that the inactivation rate was inversely related to the storage temperature. Average half-life values were between 2 and 4 days at 5 °C, and between 1 and 3 h at 30 °C. Significant differences were observed in survival between virus strains in faeces, however, not in urine. The reduction in viral RNA during the entire study period was limited.

ASFV can survive for extended time periods in animal products, carcasses, and the environment. While the ASFV genome was found in environments around infected farms, data on the virus survival in soil are scarce. We investigated different soil matrices spiked with ASFV-positive blood from infected wild boar to see if ASFV can remain infectious in the soil beneath infected carcasses. As expected, ASFV genome detection was possible over the entire sampling period. Soil pH, structure, and ambient temperature played a role in the stability of infectious ASFV. Infectious ASFV was demonstrated in specimens originating from sterile sand for at least three weeks, from beach sand for up to two weeks, from yard soil for one week, and from swamp soil for three days. The virus was not recovered from two acidic forest soils. All risk mitigation experiments with citric acid or calcium hydroxide resulted in complete inactivation. In conclusion, the stability of infectious ASFV is very low in acidic forest soils but rather high in sandy soils.

The causative African swine fever virus (ASFV) is known to be very stable in the environment. Thus, carcasses of infected wild boar could play a major role as ASFV reservoir and thereby help to locally maintain and spread the disease in wild boar populations. To minimize this risk, removal of wild boar carcasses in ASF affected areas is regarded to be crucial for effective disease control. If removal is not feasible, carcasses are usually disposed by burial on the spot to avoid direct contact of wild boar to the infection source. In this study, carcasses of ASFV infected wild boar buried in Lithuania at different time points and locations have been excavated and retested for the presence of infectious ASFV by in vitro assays and for viral genome by qPCR. Soil samples potentially contaminated by body fluids have been additionally tested for viral genome. In seventeen out of twenty burial sites, samples of excavated carcasses were positive for ASFV genome. However, in none of the carcass samples ASFV could be isolated. On seven sites soil samples contained ASF viral DNA. These results unexpectedly negate the long-term persistence of infectious ASFV in wild boar carcasses independent from the burial time. In this context, sensitivity of ASFV isolation from carcass samples versus susceptibility of animals and doses needed for oral inoculation has to be further investigated. Furthermore, research is required to consider alternative ASF infection sources and drivers in the infection cycle among wild boar. © 2020 The Authors.

Risk assessment of the disease spreading requires quantitative knowledge about time and conditions needed for its inactivation in various material of pig origin. In this study we aimed to assess ASFV stability in naturally contaminated tissues during storage in selected environmental conditions. Virus half-life (T ½) and decimal reduction rate (D-value) were determined for temperatures relevant for freezing, chilling and ambient storage. A nonlinear regression model was developed to predict T ½ for temperatures between -20 °C and +23 °C. The half-life of the infectious ASFV in tissues ranged from 31.95 days at -20 °C to 0.38 days at +23 °C, with estimated D-values between 106.12–1.27 days, respectively. In order to assess the influence of environmental conditions on the rate of ASFV inactivation in decomposing tissue, viral half-life was evaluated at +4 °C and +23 °C in tissues stored within various matrices, mimicking possible natural conditions. Water, soil and leaf litter presence induced significantly faster ASFV inactivation. Straw, hay and grain provided stable conditions and prolonged virus viability for a considerable amount of time. In contrast to viable virus reduction over time, no change in ASFV DNA concentration was detected by real-time PCR. Based on estimated half-life values, the investigated tissues are predicted to remain infectious for 353–713 days at -20 °C, 35–136 days at +4 °C, and from 9 to 17 days at +23 °C.

Five viruses, including Newcastle disease virus, infectious canine hepatitis virus, a porcine picornavirus, frog virus 3, and bovine virus diarrhea, were inoculated into a mixture of ground food waste (collected from a school lunch program) containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. Mixtures were incubated at 20, 30, and 40°C for 216 h. In a second trial, four viruses, including Newcastle disease virus, infectious canine hepatitis virus, frog virus 3, and a porcine picornavirus, were inoculated into similar edible waste material containing Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mixtures were incubated at 20 and 30°C for 216 h. Samples were obtained daily for quantitative (trial 1) and qualitative (trial 2) virus isolation. Temperature, pH, and redox potential were monitored. Controlled pH and temperature studies were also done and compared with the inactivation rates in the fermentation processes. In trial 1 (Lactobacillus fermentation), infectious canine hepatitis virus survived the entire test period in the fermentation process but was inactivated below pH 4.5 in the controlled studies. Newcastle disease virus was inactivated by day 8 in the fermentation process and appeared to be primarily heat sensitive and secondarily pH sensitive in the controlled studies. The porcine picornavirus survived the fermentation process for 8 days at 20°C but was inactivated more rapidly at 30 and 40°C. The controlled studies verified these findings. Frog virus 3 was inactivated by day 3 in the fermentation process and appeared to be sensitive to low pH in the controlled studies. Bovine virus diarrhea was rapidly inactivated in the fermentation process (less than 2 h) and was pH and temperature sensitive. In trial 2 (yeast fermentation), infectious hepatitis virus survived the entire test period in the fermentation process. Newcastle disease virus was inactivated by day 7 at 20°C and day 6 at 30°C. The porcine picornavirus was inactivated by day 7 at 30°C but survived the entire test period at 20°C. Frog virus 3 was inactivated by day 3 at 20°C and day 2 at 30°C.","1983"

Formalin (37% formaldehyde) was delivered by a commercial insecticide fogger at a flow rate of 40 ml per minute and a volume of 36 ml per cubic meter of space. Fumigated cubicles were left sealed for 18 hr (cycle 1) before viruses were sampled, or were then exposed to a second fumigation and left sealed for an additional six hour period (cycle 2) before viruses were titrated (commencing at a 1:10 dilution) for residual infectivity. Although the infectivity of all viruses was reduced by over 99% by one fumigation cycle, the second cycle was necessary for reduction of Newcastle disease and reoviruses to non-detectable (no infectivity demonstrated in a 1:10 dilution of fumigated virus) levels.","1979"

Strengthening biosecurity is the only effective measure for preventing the spread of this viral disease. The virus can be transmitted through contaminated feedstuffs and, therefore, research has been conducted to explore corresponding mitigating measures. The purpose of the current study was to test a combination of pure benzoic acid and a blend of nature identical flavorings for their ability to reduce African swine fever viral survival in feed. This virus was inoculated to feed with or without the supplementation of the test compounds, and the viral presence and load were measured by a hemadsorption test and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction. The main finding was that the combination of pure benzoic acid and nature identical flavorings could expedite the reduction in both viral load and survival in a swine feed.

A., Hakobyan, A., Zakaryan, H., Elrod, C. C.","Inhibition of African swine fever virus in liquid and feed by medium-chain fatty acids and glycerol monolaurate","Background: The ongoing African swine fever virus (ASFv) epidemic has had a major impact on pig production globally and biosecurity efforts to curb ASFv infectivity and transmission are a high priority. It has been recently identified that feed and feed ingredients, along with drinking water, can serve as transmission vehicles and might facilitate transboundary spread of ASFv. Thus, it is important to test the antiviral activity of regulatory compatible, antiviral feed additives that might inhibit ASFv infectivity in feed. One promising group of feed additive candidates includes medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) and monoglyceride derivatives, which are known to disrupt the lipid membrane surrounding certain enveloped viruses and bacteria. Results: The antiviral activities of selected MCFA, namely caprylic, capric, and lauric acids, and a related monoglyceride, glycerol monolaurate (GML), to inhibit ASFv in liquid and feed conditions were investigated and suitable compounds and inclusion rates were identified that might be useful for mitigating ASFv in feed environments. Antiviral assays showed that all tested MCFA and GML inhibit ASFv. GML was more potent than MCFA because it worked at a lower concentration and inhibited ASFv due to direct virucidal activity along with one or more other antiviral mechanisms. Dose-dependent feed experiments further showed that sufficiently high GML doses can significantly reduce ASFv infectivity in feed in a linear manner in periods as short as 30 min, as determined by infectious viral titer measurements. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments revealed that GML treatment also hinders antibody recognition of the membrane-associated ASFv p72 structural protein, which likely relates to protein conformational changes arising from viral membrane disruption. Conclusion: Together, the findings in this study indicate that MCFA and GML inhibit ASFv in liquid conditions and that GML is also able to reduce ASFv infectivity in feed, which may help to curb disease transmission. © 2020, The Author(s).","2020"

V.","The potential anti-african swine fever virus effects of medium chain fatty acids on in vitro feed model: An evaluation study using epidemic asfv strain circulating in Vietnam","Background: African swine fever (ASF) is an important disease affecting swine and has a significant economic loss in both the developed and developing world. Aim: In this study, we evaluated the potential effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) in individual and synergistic forms to prevent and/or reduce ASF virus (ASFV) infection using in vitro feed model. Methods: The cytotoxicity of MCFAs on porcine alveolar macrophages cells was evaluated by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The potential effects of MCFAs, including C8 (caprylic acid), C8-C6-C10 (caprylic acid-caproic acid-capric acid; 1:1:1 ratio) and C8-C10-C12 (caprylic acid-capric acid-lauric acid; 1:1:1 ratio) against a field ASFV strain isolated in the capital Hanoi of Vietnam, were further examined by real-time PCR and haemadsorption assays in in vitro feed model. Results: Our results indicated that all tested products do not induce cytotoxicity at the dose of 100 µg/ml and are suitable for further in vitro examination. These products have shown a strong antiviral effect against ASFV infectivity at doses of 0.375% and 0.5%. Interestingly, the synergistic MCFAs have shown clearly their potential activities against ASFV in which at a lower dose of 0.25%, pre-treatment with product two and three induced significant increases at the level of Cq value when compared to positive control and/or product 1 (p < 0.05). However, the viral titre was not changed after 24 hours post-inoculation when compared to positive control. Our findings suggested that all tested products, both individual and synergistic forms of MCFAs, have possessed a strong anti-ASFV effect, and this effect is dose-dependence in in vitro feed model. Additionally, synergistic effects of MCFAs are more effective against ASFV when compared to individual forms. Conclusion: Together, the findings in this study indicate that MCFAs, both individual and synergistic forms, inhibit against a field ASFV strain in the feed model, which may support minimizing the risk of ASF transmission in the pig population. Further studies focusing on in vivo anti-ASFV effects of MCFAs are important to bring new insight into the mode of ASFV-reduced action by these compounds in swine feed. © 2021, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

A., Arzt, J.","The risk and mitigation of foot-and-mouth disease virus infection of pigs through consumption of contaminated feed","Transboundary movement of animal feed and feed ingredients has been identified as a route for pathogen incursions. While imports of animals and animal-derived products are highly regulated for the purpose of infectious disease prevention, there has been less consideration of the viability of infectious agents in inanimate products, such as feed. This study investigated the ability of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) to remain infectious as a contaminant of commercial whole pig feed and select pig feed ingredients, and to establish the minimum infectious dose (MIDF) required to cause foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in pigs that consumed contaminated feed. FMDV viability in vitro varied depending on virus strain, feed product, and storage temperature, with increased duration of infectivity in soybean meal compared to pelleted whole feed. Specifically, both strains of FMDV evaluated remained viable through to the end of the 37 day observation period in experimentally contaminated soybean meal stored at 4 or 20°C. The MIDF for pigs consuming contaminated feed varied across virus strains and exposure duration in the range of 106.2 to 107 TCID50. The ability of FMDV to cause infection in exposed pigs was mitigated by pre-treatment of feed with two commercially available feed additives, based on either formaldehyde (SalCURB®) or lactic acid (Guardian™). Our findings demonstrate that FMDV may remain infectious in pig feed ingredients for durations compatible with transoceanic transport. Although the observed MIDF was relatively high, variations in feeding conditions and biophysical characteristics of different virus strains may alter the probability of infection. These findings may be used to parameterize modelling of the risk of FMDV incursions and to regulate feed importation to minimize the risk of inadvertent importation. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Stability of African swine fever virus on spiked spray-dried porcine plasma Transboundary and Emerging Diseases, 68(5),  2806-2811","Fischer, M., Pikalo, J., Beer, M., Blome, S.","Stability of African swine fever virus on spiked spray-dried porcine plasma","African swine fever (ASF) is a viral disease that affects members of the Suidae family. The notifiable disease is considered a major threat to the pig industry, animal health, and food security worldwide. According to the European Food Safety Authority, ASF virus (ASFV) survival and transmission in feed and feed materials is a major research gap. Against this background, the objective of this study was to determine the survival of ASFV on spiked spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) when stored at two different temperatures. To this means, commercial SDPP granules were contaminated with high titers of ASFV in a worst-case external contamination scenario. Three samples per time point and temperature condition were subjected to blind passaging on macrophage cultures and subsequent haemadsorption test to determine residual infectivity. In addition, viral genome was detected by real-time PCR. The results indicate that heavily contaminated SDPP stored at 4°C remains infectious for at least 5 weeks. In contrast, spiked SDPP stored at room temperature displayed a distinct ASFV titer reduction after 1 week (>2.8 log levels) and complete inactivation after 2 weeks (>5.7 log levels). In conclusion, the residual risk of ASFV transmission through externally contaminated SDPP is low if SDPP is stored at room temperature (21 ± 2°C) for a period of at least 2 weeks before feeding. © 2021 The Authors.

Within Europe, including Germany, affected wild boar populations play a major role. Fencing and carcass removal in combination with the reduction in environmental contamination are key to control further spread. The handling of the ASF virus (ASFV) is restricted to high-containment conditions in Germany. According to the regulation of the German Veterinarian Society (DVG), modified vaccinia Ankara virus (MVAV) is the virus of choice to determine the efficacy of disinfection for enveloped viruses. The aim of this study was to use the MVAV as a guide to select the best possible disinfectant solution and concentration for the inactivation of ASFV in soil. Both viruses were tested simultaneously. In this study, two layers (top and mineral soil) of soil types from six different locations in Saxony, Germany, were collected. The tenacity of ASFV and MVAV were tested at various time points (0.5 to 72 h). The capabilities of different concentrations of peracetic acid and citric acid (approx. 0.1 to 2%) to inactivate the viruses in the selected soil types with spiked high protein load were examined under appropriate containment conditions. Around 2-3 Log10 (TCID50) levels of reduction in the infectivity of both ASFV and MVAV were observed in all soil types starting after two hours. For MVAV, a 4 Log10 loss was recorded after 72 h. A total of 0.1% of peracetic acid (5 L/m2) was sufficient to inactivate the viruses. A 4 log10 reduction in the infectivity of MVAV was noticed by applying 1% citric acid, while a 2 log10 decline was recorded with ASFV. In conclusion, comparing MVAV to ASFV for efficacy screening of disinfectant solutions has revealed many similarities. Peracetic acid reduced the infectivity of both viruses independently of the soil type and the existence of a high organic soiling. © 2021 by the authors.","2021"
