In this study, a commercial rapid immuno-chromatographic method or Lateral Flow Test (LFT) device, for the detection of BT virus-specific antibodies in animal serum, was evaluated in an international inter laboratory proficiency test. The evaluation was done with sera samples of variable background (ruminant species, serotype, field samples, experimental infections, vaccinated animals). The diagnostic sensitivity was 100% (95% C.I. [90.5-100]) and the diagnostic specificity was 95.2% (95% C.I. [76.2-99.9]). The repeatability (accordance) and reproducibility (concordance) were 100% for seropositive samples but were lower for two of the seronegative samples (45% and 89% respectively). The analytical sensitivity, evaluated by testing positive sera at increasing dilutions was better for the BT LFT compared to some commercial ELISAs. Seroconversion of an infected sheep was detected at 4 days post infection. Analytical specificity was impaired by cross-reactions observed with some of the samples seropositive for Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (EHDV). The agreement (Cohen's kappa) between the LFT and a commercial BT competitive ELISA was 0.79 (95% CI [0.62-0.95]). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the BT LFT device is a rapid and sensitive first-line serological test that can be used in the field, especially in areas endemic for the disease where there is a lack of diagnostic facilities.

Niedbalski","Evaluation of commercial ELISA kits for the detection of antibodies against bluetongue virus","The aim of this study was to estimate the diagnostic value of different commercially available ELISA kits for the detection of bluetongue virus (BTV) antibodies in infected and vaccinated animals. The relative specificity of ELISA kits was evaluated using a panel of sera originating from healthy cattle, never vaccinated nor exposed to BTV. All ELISA kits applied had a high relative specificity (99.3 - 100%). The relative sensitivity of ELISA kits assessed using a panel of sera collected from BTV infected cattle was also high and similar for all the kits (97.3 - 100%). However, the relative sensitivity evaluated on the basis of testing vaccinated animals was different: the highest sensitivity was found for Ingenasa, PrioCHECK and ID VET ELISAs (96.5 - 98.3%). Slightly lower sensitivity was calculated for Pourquier and LSI kits (82.8% and 85.4%, respectively) and much lower sensitivity was found for VMRD ELISA kit (69.5%). The repeatability of BTV ELISA kits was expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV) of results of sera tested 5 times in the same day and in different days by the period of 2 months, by the same person, in the same conditions, and by using the same equipment. The CVs of sera tested in all ELISA kits ranged from 6.1 to 9.8% and were below 10% threshold adopted as a maximum for the acceptable repeatability of the method. In conclusion, it can be stated that the applied ELISA kits can be a valuable diagnostic tool for the serological monitoring studies in the BTV contaminated premises. All the methods are very specific and sensitive when testing BTV infected animals. Nevertheless, the Ingenasa and PrioCHECK can be the most useful in sero-surveillance of livestock following vaccination.",2011

The performance of this cELISA was evaluated on both field results obtained during the 2001 surveillance campaigns and experimental results. ROC analyses were carried out using RT-PCR results as gold standard for determining the infection status of animals. From all these sets of data, cut-off values optimising the diagnostic accuracy of the test were computed. Their values ranged around the manufacturer's 50% threshold from 41% to 63%. The area under the ROC curve obtained from field data was 0.843 (95% CI: 0.762-0.923). In all our results, it appeared also that the specificity of the cELISA test was always perfect if the cut-off was at least at 80%. This cELISA test does not seem sufficient to diagnose BT disease in animals with BT-like symptoms. However, complementary data are needed to better estimate sensitivity and specificity values of this BT test for its use either as a diagnostic tool in infected areas or as a screening test in BT-free areas. The use and validity of RT-PCR results as gold standard are discussed. As the lack of suitable data strongly limited the applicable analyses, a discussion based on the OIE recommendations about test evaluation is initiated. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In a nationwide cross-sectional study with partial verification, 2437 cattle sera collected from 507 herds were analysed using competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (c-ELISA). To adjust for misclassification, 158 sera, including 86 that were recorded equivocal in Switzerland, were sent to the Office Internationale des Epizooties designated regional reference laboratory in the UK for confirmation. No BTV antibody was detected in any of these samples, confirming the absence of BTV from Switzerland in 2003. The specificity of the c-ELISA used in Switzerland for individual Swiss cattle was calculated to be 96.5%. The mean herd sensitivity achieved in our survey ranged from 78.9% to 98.8% depending on the with-in herd prevalence and test sensitivity used for the calculations. The cumulated confidence level achieved with the survey based on a minimal expected prevalence of 2%, was 99.99% and therefore it was concluded that there was no evidence of BTV circulation in Switzerland in 2003.

Fisher","Evaluation of bluetongue virus diagnostic tests in free-ranging bighorn sheep","Five bluetongue virus (BTV) diagnostic tests were evaluated for use in free-ranging bighorn sheep. We sampled one bighorn sheep population four times between 1989 and 1995. The tests evaluated included virus isolation (VI), polymerase-chain reaction (PCR), serum neutralization (SN), agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGID), and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA). The c-ELISA, AGID and SN tests had high levels of agreement in determining serogroup exposure in bighorn sheep. We used maximum-likelihood algorithms to estimate the parameters of each diagnostic test used. Although the c-ELISA and AGID had high sensitivity and specificity, the SN had perfect specificity but lower apparent sensitivity. Due to the potential of cross-reactions among multiple serotypes, results of the SN must be interpreted with caution when assessing serotype exposure in an area where multiple serotypes an endemic. The PCR assay delineated convalescent antibody titers from more-recent infections, and consequently, was pivotal in distinguishing a different exposure pattern between the bighorn sheep and cattle in an adjacent herd. Based on an increasing seroprevalence (50% to 100%), BTV circulated through this bighorn sheep population between 1989 and 1993, This increase in seroprevalence coincided with a bighorn die-off due to BTV infection in June, 1991. An adjacent cattle herd was sampled in 1995 for comparison. The bighorn sheep and adjacent cattle had different patterns of exposure to BTV between 1994 and 1995. There was no evidence that BTV circulated through the bighorn sheep population from 1994 to 1995. In 1995, seroprevalence to BTV decreased to 72%, none of yearling bighorn was seropositive, and all of the 39 bighorn sheep were PCR-negative. In contrast, all adult cattle were seropositive to BTV by c-ELISA and SN, and 4 of the calves were seropositive; 11 of the 24 cattle were PCR-positive, including all five calves. Overall, the pattern of temporal herd immunity in the bighorn sheep appeared to follow a classic epidemic curve, with the appearance and subsequent disappearance of herd immunity coinciding with the 1991 die-off in this population. As low levels of herd immunity and high proportions of susceptible animals are key factors in the development of epidemics, this population of bighorn sheep may be at increased risk for a BTV epidemic in the future.

The c-ELISA, AGID and SN tests had high levels of agreement in determining serogroup exposure in bighorn sheep. We used maximum-likelihood algorithms to estimate the parameters of each diagnostic test used. Although the c-ELISA and AGID had high sensitivity and specificity, the SN had perfect specificity but lower apparent sensitivity. Due to the potential of cross-reactions among multiple serotypes, results of the SN must be interpreted with caution when assessing serotype exposure in an area where multiple serotypes an endemic. The PCR assay delineated convalescent antibody titers from more-recent infections, and consequently, was pivotal in distinguishing a different exposure pattern between the bighorn sheep and cattle in an adjacent herd. Based on an increasing seroprevalence (50% to 100%), BTV circulated through this bighorn sheep population between 1989 and 1993, This increase in seroprevalence coincided with a bighorn die-off due to BTV infection in June, 1991. An adjacent cattle herd was sampled in 1995 for comparison. The bighorn sheep and adjacent cattle had different patterns of exposure to BTV between 1994 and 1995. There was no evidence that BTV circulated through the bighorn sheep population from 1994 to 1995. In 1995, seroprevalence to BTV decreased to 72%, none of yearling bighorn was seropositive, and all of the 39 bighorn sheep were PCR-negative. In contrast, all adult cattle were seropositive to BTV by c-ELISA and SN, and 4 of the calves were seropositive; 11 of the 24 cattle were PCR-positive, including all five calves. Overall, the pattern of temporal herd immunity in the bighorn sheep appeared to follow a classic epidemic curve, with the appearance and subsequent disappearance of herd immunity coinciding with the 1991 die-off in this population. As low levels of herd immunity and high proportions of susceptible animals are key factors in the development of epidemics, this population of bighorn sheep may be at increased risk for a BTV epidemic in the future.

Rapid and reliable assays are therefore essential for the confirmation of clinical diagnoses and to enable control strategies to be implemented without undue delay. One of the major objectives of a recent European Union funded project was the validation of newly developed diagnostic assays which are rapid, sensitive, highly reproducible and inexpensive, for the detection of African horse sickness virus (AHSV) antigens and antibodies. The Laboratorio de Sanidad y Produccion Animal (LSPA) in Algete, Spain was charged with the responsibility of co-ordinating and supplying samples of viruses and antisera to the participating laboratories in Spain, France and the United Kingdom. The panels comprised 76 antigen samples for assay by indirect sandwich ELISAs and 53 serum samples for antibody detection by either indirect or competitive ELISAs. Results generated by ELISA for each laboratory were analysed in LSPA in terms of their relative sensitivities and specificities. There was a good agreement between the ELISAs used for either antigen or antibody detection. The participating groups agreed that any field sample giving a doubtful result would always be retested by ELISA and an alternative assay.",1998

Three of the ponies died suddenly after showing mild clinical signs, the fourth pony remained clinically normal and was killed at day 38. Infectious AHSV was isolated from blood samples collected at intervals from all four ponies. Positive antigen ELISA reactions were only observed with blood samples from two of the ponies on the two days preceding death. Specific AHSV antibodies were detected by ELISA in serum samples from the other two ponies although one eventually died. African horse sickness viral antigens were detected by ELISA in post-mortem tissue samples collected from all four ponies. No infectious virus could be detected in tissue samples taken post-mortem from the pony which survived African horse sickness (AHS) infection. In the event of a suspected outbreak of AHS it is recommended that sera and heparinized blood should be tested for specific antibodies and AHSV antigen respectively. When available, post-mortem tissues, including spleen, heart, lung and liver, should also be tested for AHSV antigen. Although the ELISA used for the detection of AHSV antigen is highly sensitive and specific, negative ELISA results should be confirmed by virus isolation attempts.",1992

Four different VSV preparations were compared for use as antigen in the ELISA: virus used in neutralization tests, complement-fixation antigen, immunodiffusion agar gel antigen and viral glycoprotein. Comparative antibody titration results of virus neutralization (VN) and ELISA showed no statistically significant difference between serum titres obtained with the 4 antigens to VSV-NJ and VSV-IND 1. The viral glycoprotein antigen was incorporated in the ELISA system because it is non-infectious and induces neutralizing antibodies. The reliability and variability of the ELISA was determined by testing 516 bovine, equine and swine sera which originated from areas free of vesicular stomatitis, and by testing 186 sera from areas where outbreaks occur. ELISA and VN results were correlated, and no statistically significant difference was found between replications of the tests. The ELISA allows the testing of a larger number of sera in a shorter time than is possible with the VN test and it can be used in diagnostic laboratories in VSV-free areas for the support of epidemiological surveillance programmes.",1992

Unger","Immunodiffusion test antigen from bluetongue virus-infected newborn mouse brains","Three methods of extracting bluetongue virus (BTV)-infected newborn mouse brains to prepare immunodiffusion (ID) test antigen were used. The most readily readable and reproducible results were obtained with fluorocarbon-extracted brains homogenized in 8.5% sucrose. Mouse brain- and reference cell culture-derived antigens gave a line of identity with anti-BTV serum. Extracts of noninfected brains were nonreactive. ID tests on field-collected bovine sera, comparing the two types of antigen, resulted in only 73% agreement due to a greater sensitivity of cell culture-derived antigen. A 70.5% agreement resulted when comparing mouse brain-derived antigen in ID tests with complement fixation tests, the latter being least sensitive.

The assay was evaluated in comparison with a gold standard real-time RT-PCR assay using more than 200 samples, comprising samples from recent PPRV outbreaks, experimentally-infected goats, well-characterised cell culture isolates and samples collected from uninfected animals. The RT-LAMP assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity and greater than 97% diagnostic sensitivity in comparison with the real-time RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection was between 0.3 and 0.8 log10 TCID50 ml-1 equating to a CT value of 31.52 to 33.48. In experimentally-infected animals, the RT-LAMP could detect PPRV as early as 4 days post infection (dpi) - before clinical signs were observed at 7 dpi.

Materials and Methods: An outbreak resembled to PPR occurred in two different places of southern Gujarat viz. Vapi and Navsari, affecting 622 animals, including both goat (n = 476) and sheep (n = 146). Animals displayed the typical signs of PPR at Vapi however diarrhea was the inconsistent feature in animals of Navsari. The affection caused morbidity of 100% and mortality were 73.68% (n = 392/532) and 56.67% (n = 51/90) in Vapi and Navsari outbreaks, respectively. Relevant ante mortem and post mortem samples were collected from representative animals. At the outset of the epidemic no kit was available with us, so agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) was carried out and a commercial ELISA (cELISA) kit was ordered for making diagnosis through antibody demonstration. Meanwhile, an iELISA was developed in house using PPR vaccine as antigen and protein G conjugated HRPO antibody as detector. Histopathology and results of sandwich ELISA were also used to diagnose PPR virus (PPRV) in the outbreak. Results: The iELISA developed had detected PPRV antibodies in 22/24 samples (91.66%). Significant difference was observed in disease sensitivity pattern of two species by Chi-square test. While AGID failed to detect antibodies in any sample. Results were reconfirmed by comparing with commercially available cELISA kit. Conclusion: PPR is an economically important disease and for the rapid diagnosis of PPR the in house developed antibody capture iELISA can be a suitable cost effective alternative.

The samples were tested by using N protein based MAb based sandwich ELISA (sELISA) and subsequently RT-PCR targeting Fusion (F) and Nucleoprotein (N) genes of PPR virus. The F and N gene specific PCR amplicons were sequenced and assessed for sequence variations with existing and circulating PPR virus strains and vaccine isolates. The results of this study presents PPR virus antigen in 48.27% clinical samples (28/58) using sELISA confirming this outbreak of PPR in goats. Amplification with primers F1/F2 for F gene yielded an expected amplicon of 372 bp and N1/N2 primer sets yielded an amplicon of 463 bp for N gene in reference vaccine virus as well as 28 field samples. In phylogeny, different patterns of branching based on N and F gene sequences and clustering of many of the central Indian PPR virus isolates with isolates from bordering countries was seen. The results confirm that heterogeneous population of PPR virus isolates is circulating in India which moreover emphasize the significance of molecular methods to understand the epidemiology and diversity of PPR virus in the country. The information from such studies will help in achieving the target of controlling and eradicating the disease, especially when the country is planning to launch the control programs in many states after the successful stamping out of the Rinderpest.  2015 Academic Journals Inc.",2015

In phylogeny, different patterns of branching based on N and F gene sequences and clustering of many of the central Indian PPR virus isolates with isolates from bordering countries was seen. The results confirm that heterogeneous population of PPR virus isolates is circulating in India which moreover emphasize the significance of molecular methods to understand the epidemiology and diversity of PPR virus in the country. The information from such studies will help in achieving the target of controlling and eradicating the disease, especially when the country is planning to launch the control programs in many states after the successful stamping out of the Rinderpest.  2015 Academic Journals Inc.",2015

The disease is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharge, pneumonia, necrosis and ulceration of the mucous membrane and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract leading to severe diarrhea. A SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR targeting the N gene of PPRV has not been established for PPRV detection. Thus, the objective of present study was to develop highly sensitive N gene target SYBR Green I real time RT-PCR for specific detection and quantification of PPRV in clinical samples. A set of primers was designed to detect the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PPRV.Results: The assay exhibited high specificity as all the viruses which have clinical and structural similarities to PPRV including Canine distemper virus (CDV), Measles virus (MV), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to show an amplification signal. The lower detection limit of the assay was 5.11 copies/l (Ct value of 33.67  0.5) and 0.001 TCID50/ml (Ct value of 34.7  0.5) based on plasmid copy number and tissue culture infectivity titre. The assay was 3-log more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR. The coefficient of variation (CV) values for intra- and inter-assay variability were low, ranging from 0.32% - 2.31%, and 0.71% - 5.32%, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the newly developed assay, a total of 36 clinical samples suspected of PPR were screened for the presence of PPRV in parallel with conventional RT-PCR. The real time RT-PCR assay detected PPRV in 30 (83.3%) of clinical samples compared to 16 (44.4%) by conventional RT-PCR.Conclusions: The two-step SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR assay reported here is highly sensitive, specific, reproducible and rapid for detection and quantification of PPRV nucleic acids.  2014 Abera et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014

The maximum sensitivity and specificity of 100% was observed by NP3 and NP4 primer based RT-PCR whereas, 0% sensitivity was recorded by pprn_fr2/pprn_rev which fail to detect any positive sample. The overall agreement of 100% with kappa value 1.00 was highest between S-ELISA and NP3 and NP4 primer based RT-PCR suggesting an almost perfect agreement, followed by N1/N2, having kappa value of 0.800, suggesting a substantial agreement.

Materials and Methods: The prevalence of PPR virus antibodies among domestic animals (goat, sheep, cattle and camel) populations in NE Nigeria was studied using virus neutralisation test (VNT) and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA). Results: An overall seroprevalence of 57% and 55% were revealed using VNT and c-ELISA, respectively. Significant difference (p<0.05) in the prevalence of PPR antibodies was noted between the different species of animals tested. Highest seroprevalence of 76.5% was found in sheep followed by a decreasing order of prevalence in goat 51.6%, camels 27.8% and cattle 16.7%. Similar pattern of prevalence was noted when the sera were tested for PPR using c-ELISA antibody. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity of both the procedures (VNT and c-ELISA) when used for the detection of PPR antibody in test sera. However, differences were noted in their specificity based on the degree of cross reactivity between PPR and rinderpest (RP) antibodies. Higher percentage of PPR positive sera (goats 64.8% and sheep 63.8%) cross-reacted with RP virus in VNT. None of the PPR positive sera from cattle and camels cross-reacted with RP virus in VNT and c-ELISA. Significant difference in gender and age was noted in the prevalence of PPR antibody among goats and sheep. Specificall, higher prevalence was found in females and the seroprevalence increased with age among the different age groups of goats studied. Analysis of the seasonal distribution of prevalence of PPR antibody in positive samples did not reveal any significant difference between seasons. Conclusion:We conclude that PPR virus is actively circulating among the ruminant and dromedary populations and that the infection may be endemic in the study area. Significant findings from our study indicate that cattle and camel could play a key role in the epidemiology of PPR, especially in areas like the one under this study where small ruminants are reared alongside cattle and/or camels. Further studies are necessary to fully elucidate, the pivotal roles of cattle and camel in the transmission cycle of PPR virus.  The authors.",2013

Methods: Epitope peptides of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of Tibetan PPRV were synthesized chemically and injected into rabbits to prepare hyperimmune antisera. Test sera were incubated simultaneously with hyperimmune antisera and added to the wells of ELISA plates coated previously with recombinant N protein. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was employed to detect the quantity of hyperimmune antisera combined with recombinant N protein. Results: A cELISA has been developed for monitoring PPRV infections with a cutoff value of 35. Relative sensitivity and specificity values of the epitope-based cELISA were 96.18 and 91.29%, respectively, when compared with a commercial cELISA kit in a test involving 1,039 serum samples. Conclusion: We report an efficient method for preparing antibody suitable for incorporation into a cELISA that can be used routinely for the detection of PPRV antibodies in serum samples. The method eliminated the requirement for virus culture and monoclonal antibody preparation, reduced the biorisk posed by virus-dependent manipulations, and the performance of the resultant cELISA compared favorably with a commercially available cELISA kit.

The indirect ELISA compared very well with competitive ELISA, with a high degree of specificity (95.09%) and sensitivity (90.81%). When compared with virus neutralization test, the present assay had 100% specificity and 80% sensitivity. With serum samples, the assay could clearly differentiate animals from the infected population from uninfected ones. These results suggest that the indirect ELISA may be a good alternative tool to competitive ELISA for seroepidemiological surveys.  Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2007.",2007

The test is specific to PPR as it failed to detect rinderpest vaccine virus (RBOK strain). Varieties of clinical samples originating from laboratory experiments (n = 231) and from field (n = 259) were employed to test the efficacy of sandwich-ELISA test. The test compared very well with an internationally accepted commercial Immune-capture ELISA kit, which uses biotinylated monoclonal antibody against the nucleocapsid protein. On a parallel testing using 490 clinical samples, 4G6 MAb based sandwich ELISA had an overall relative diagnostic specificity of 92.8% and diagnostic sensitivity of 88.9% compared to the commercial kit. The newly developed test is free from prozone phenomenon. PPR outbreaks from various parts of India have been confirmed using the test.

Efficacy of c-ELISA compared very well with VNT having high relative specificity (98.4%) and sensitivity (92.4%). The sensitivity of c-ELISA for PPR sero-surveillance could further be increased (95.4%), if the target population is non-vaccinated. c-ELISA test correlated well with VNT (r=0.845) for end-point titration of PPR virus antibody in 64 goat sera samples. It could clearly separate infected population from uninfected in field sera. Using c-ELISA test paired sera samples from 13 goats provided a clear diagnosis of PPR virus infection. Furthermore, antibodies to PPR virus could be successfully detected during 1 year after vaccination in four goats inoculated with an experimental PPR vaccine. Findings suggest that the c-ELISA test developed can easily replace VNT for sero-surveillance, sero-monitoring, diagnosis from paired sera samples and end-point titration of PPR virus antibodies.  2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2004

The sensitivity of c-ELISA for PPR sero-surveillance could further be increased (95.4%), if the target population is non-vaccinated. c-ELISA test correlated well with VNT (r=0.845) for end-point titration of PPR virus antibody in 64 goat sera samples. It could clearly separate infected population from uninfected in field sera. Using c-ELISA test paired sera samples from 13 goats provided a clear diagnosis of PPR virus infection. Furthermore, antibodies to PPR virus could be successfully detected during 1 year after vaccination in four goats inoculated with an experimental PPR vaccine. Findings suggest that the c-ELISA test developed can easily replace VNT for sero-surveillance, sero-monitoring, diagnosis from paired sera samples and end-point titration of PPR virus antibodies.  2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.",2004

This protein was obtained in large quantities from insect cells infected with a PPR nucleoprotein recombinant baculovirus (N-B). The competitive ELISA was compared with the virus neutralisation test (VNT) for detecting specific antibodies to PPRV in sheep and goats. The time consuming VNT is the only prescribed test that is capable of distinguishing between PPRV and the cross-reactive rinderpest virus (RPV). The competitive ELISA involves the simultaneous addition of the mAb and antibodies present in a positive serum, leading to competition for a specific epitope on the N-B. Optimum conditions were obtained by using serum samples which had positive or negative neutralising activity against PPRV Or RPV. A negative cut-off point was determined on PPRV-negative sera from RPV-vaccinated cattle. A threshold value of 48 per cent inhibition, calculated from the mean for this population plus 27 standard deviations, was used in routine testing. A total of 683 sera were analysed by the competitive ELISA and the VNT. A good correlation (r = 094) was observed between the titres obtained in the two tests, with 80 sera that were from laboratory sources. The agreement between the two tests was determined on 271 field sera (kappa = 0825). Their relative sensitivity (945 per cent) and specificity (994 per cent) were assessed on the 148 laboratory sera plus the 271 sera used for the determination of kappa. The durations of passive immunity in 23 goats, as determined by the VNT and the competitive ELISA, were 120 and 90 days, respectively, which indicates some differences between the anti-haemagglutinin and anti-N protein kinetics. The competitive ELISA is as sensitive and specific as the VNT, with the added advantage that it uses an antigen that is safe and can be produced in large quantities.  1995.",1995

For the comparison, nine hundred and thirty-seven swine serum samples were tested by serum neutralization followed by immunoperoxidase staining (NPLA), considered as the standard. Of these, 223 were positive and 714 negative for neutralizing antibodies to classical swine fever virus (CSFV). In relation to the NPLA, the ELISA-I presented a 98.2% sensitivity; 92.86% specificity, 81.11% positive predictive value, 99.4% negative predictive value and a 94.1% precision. Statistical analysis showed a very strong correlation (r=0,94) between both tests. When compared to a commercially available ELISA kit, the performance of both, in relation to the NPLA, was similar. It was concluded that the ELISA-I is suitable for large scale screening of antibodies to classical swine fever virus, although it does not distinguish antibodies to classical swine fever virus from those induced by other pestiviruses.",1999

Results: In the study, a platform for the rapid and simple production of nanobody-HRP fusion protein was constructed. First, a total of 9 anti-NDV-NP protein nanobodies were screened from a immunised Bactrian camel.

Methods: Full length and C-terminally truncated nucleocapsid (NP) protein, and the unique C-terminal regions of the phospho- (P) and V proteins of the NDV LaSota strain were bacterially expressed as fusion proteins with the multimerization domain of the human C4 binding protein, and used as diagnostic antigens in indirect ELISA. Results: When used as diagnostic antigen in indirect ELISAs, recombinant full-length proved to be a sensitive target to detect seroconversion in chickens after APMV-1 vaccination and infection, but revealed some degree of cross reactivity with sera raised against other APMV subtypes.

In domestic ducks (n = 158) from NDV-positive duck farms (n = 8), the positive rates according to C-ELISA were significantly higher than those according to the HI test. At the same time, 98.1% of ducks (n = 209) from NDV-negative duck farms (n = 11) were also negative by C-ELISA.

The Mab utilised is specific for a conserved PMV-1 serotype- specific epitope, as demonstrated by the indirect immunoperoxidase test. It reacted with all strains representing different serogroups within the PMV-1 serotype, but not with any strain belonging to other PMV serotypes. Sensitivity and specificity of the B-ELISA were compared with the haemagglutination inhibition test (HI). Blocking and HI antibodies were detected in sera of chickens 8 days post-experimental infection. The B-ELISA proved consistently more sensitive than the HI test. In another survey, 62 sera from experimentally vaccinated chickens were tested; 95.2% proved positive by B-ELISA, 85.5% by indirect ELISA and 74% by HI test. When 504 field sera from vaccinated chickens and turkeys were tested, 98% were positive by B-ELISA, and 69% by HI. The specificity was evaluated by testing 1066 samples from NDV-free flocks, all of which proved negative by both methods.

Here, we exploited this system to construct and evaluate a diagnostic tool for glanders. Burkholderia mallei, the causative agent of glanders, is a highly infectious and fatal zoonotic pathogen that infects horses, mules, donkeys, and occasionally humans. A highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tool is crucial for the control, elimination, and eradication of B. mallei infections. We constructed plasmids carrying synthetic genes encoding a modified, previously unannotated Burkholderia glycoprotein containing three glycosylation sequons fused to the cholera toxin B-subunit. The resulting proteins were glycosylated in the B. cenocepacia K56-2 parental strain, but not in glycosylation-deficient mutants, as determined by SDS-PAGE and fluorescent lectin blots. One of these glycoproteins was used as an antigen in ELISA and western blots to screen a panel of serum samples collected from glanders-infected and healthy horses, which were previously investigated by complement fixation test and indirect ELISA based on a semi-purified fraction of B. mallei. We show that ELISA and western blot assays based on our glycoprotein antigen provide 100% specificity, with a sensitivity greater than 88%. The glycoprotein antigen was recognized by serum samples collected from patients infected with B. pseudomallei, B. mallei, B. multivorans, and B. cenocepacia. Our results indicate that protein O-glycosylation in Burkholderia can be exploited as a biomarker for diagnosis of Burkholderia-associated infections.  2021 The Author(s).

Here, we exploited this system to construct and evaluate a diagnostic tool for glanders. Burkholderia mallei, the causative agent of glanders, is a highly infectious and fatal zoonotic pathogen that infects horses, mules, donkeys, and occasionally humans. A highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tool is crucial for the control, elimination, and eradication of B. mallei infections. We constructed plasmids carrying synthetic genes encoding a modified, previously unannotated Burkholderia glycoprotein containing three glycosylation sequons fused to the cholera toxin B-subunit. The resulting proteins were glycosylated in the B. cenocepacia K56-2 parental strain, but not in glycosylation-deficient mutants, as determined by SDS-PAGE and fluorescent lectin blots. One of these glycoproteins was used as an antigen in ELISA and western blots to screen a panel of serum samples collected from glanders-infected and healthy horses, which were previously investigated by complement fixation test and indirect ELISA based on a semi-purified fraction of B. mallei. We show that ELISA and western blot assays based on our glycoprotein antigen provide 100% specificity, with a sensitivity greater than 88%. The glycoprotein antigen was recognized by serum samples collected from patients infected with B. pseudomallei, B. mallei, B. multivorans, and B. cenocepacia. Our results indicate that protein O-glycosylation in Burkholderia can be exploited as a biomarker for diagnosis of Burkholderia-associated infections.  2021 The Author(s).

Despite the importance of B. mallei, little is known about serodiagnosis of glanders. The present study aimed to develop an immunoblotting assay based on whole-cell proteome of B. mallei to enable accurate serodiagnosis of glanders. Materials and Methods: Three farm horses were subcutaneously immunized with a crude suspension (106 cfu/ml) of heat-inactivated B. mallei formulated with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) to achieve a hyperimmune sera panel. The immunization was done for 1, 14 and 28 days with 1 dose of 1 ml antigen containing 106 cfu/ml. The hyperimmunity of sera was confirmed by CFT. B. mallei whole-cell proteome was prepared through sonication and the protein content was visualized by SDS-PAGE and quantified by Western blot using HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-horse IgG. A comprehensive set of positive and negative horse sera validated the test. Results: A ladder pattern of the B. mallei immunoreactive antigens was seen within the region of 20-90 kDa clearly and the immunoblot was scored positive, while no reaction was seen for the negative sera. The Western blot assay indicated a noticeably higher diagnostic specificity for positive or negative sera of glanders. Conclusion: The whole-cell proteome-based immunoblot proved reliable and straightforward in our study. The prepared antigen was adaptable for application in immunoblotting.

Although a good advance has been made to understand the virus, a safe and effective vaccine against ASFV is still lacking and its eradication solely depends on its early and accurate diagnosis. Thus, improving the available diagnostic assays and adding some validated techniques are useful for a range of serological investigations. The aim of this study was to produce and characterize p54 monoclonal antibodies with an ultimate goal of developing a mono-clonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for ASFV antibody detection. Five monoclonal antibodies against p54 protein expressed in Escherichia coli was generated and their characterizations were investigated. Furthermore, a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) based on a monoclonal antibody designated as 2A7 was developed. To evaluate the performance of the assay, a total of 365 pig serum samples (178 negative and 187 positive samples) were tested and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to determine the cut-off value. Based on the ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.982 (95% confidence interval: 96.9% to 99.4%), besides a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 98.9% was achieved when the percent inhibition of 20% was selected as a threshold. Moreover, the result showed an excellent agreement when compared to other commercially available blocking ELISA (kappa value = 0.912) and showed no reaction to other swine pathogens. Overall, the newly developed cELISA method offers a promising approach for a rapid and convenient ASFV serodiagnosis, which could be used as alternative to other serological assays for screening possible ASFV infection.  2021 by the authors.

Although serological techniques play a secondary role in the confirmation of clinical cases, their use is very important for all the other purposes due to their high throughput, ease of use and good cost-benefit ratio. The main objective of this study was to support the validation of AHS VP7 Blocking ELISA up to the Stage 3 of the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) assay validation pathway. To achieve this, a collaborative ring trial, which included all OIE Reference Laboratories and other AHS-specialist diagnostic centres, was conducted in order to assess the diagnostic performance characteristics of the VP7 Blocking ELISA. In this trial, a panel of sera of different epidemiological origin and infection status was used. Through this comprehensive evaluation we can conclude that the VP7 Blocking ELISA satisfies the OIE requirements of reproducibility. The VP7 Blocking ELISA, in its commercial version is ready to enter Stage 4 of the validation pathway (Programme Implementation). Specifically, this will require testing the diagnostic performance of the assay using contemporary serum samples collected during control campaigns in endemic countries.  2018 The Authors.

In addition, the performance of different serological techniques for antibody detection against LSDV was compared. For sample collection, an area without previous LSD outbreak reports in Serbia was selected. Seventy-nine cattle from twenty farms vaccinated in 2016 and re-vaccinated in 2017 were included in the study. Two farms from the same area with good calving management were selected for investigation of passive LSDV antibody transfer from vaccinated mothers to new-borne calves. Results: All investigated cattle were healthy on the day of vaccination and during the whole study. Swelling at the injection site or other side effects of vaccination did not occur after re-vaccination in the study. Detection of LSD-specific antibodies was performed with the standard serological methods VNT and IFAT as well as a commercially available Capripox double antigen multi-species-ELISA. Capripoxvirus-specific antibodies were detected 46 to 47 weeks after vaccination in 2016, with VNT in 35.06% and with IFAT and ELISA in 33.77%. A secondary response was observed in all three tests 1 month after re-vaccination with a significant increase in seropositive animals compared to the results before re-vaccination. With all applied serological methods, the number of animals testing positive was significantly higher at 1 and 5 months post re-vaccination than before re-vaccination. No significant statistical difference (p &gt; 0.05) was observed between the results of all three tests used. The sensitivity and specificity of ELISA was estimated to be SeELISA 91% and SpELISA 87% calculated by the results of VNT and SeELISA 88% and SpELISA 76% calculated by the results of IFAT.

The multiplex ELISA was designed using selected, type-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) coated onto ELISA plates as catching antibodies and a unique pan-FMDV MAb (1F10) as detector conjugate. Capture MAbs with the broadest intratypic reactivity were selected for each of the four FMDV serotypes by screening large panels of candidate MAbs with a wide spectrum of representative FMDV isolates. An additional pan-FMDV ELISA using 1F10 MAb for both capture and detection was used to complement the specific typing ELISAs to detect virus isolates, which might escape binding to the selected serotype-specific MAbs. This multiplex ELISA was prepared in a stabilized format, with immunoplates pre-coated with six MAbs and positive antigen controls already trapped by the relevant MAb, with the view to make available a diagnostic kit. Diagnostic performance of the MAbsmultiplex ELISA was analysed using 299 FMDV-positive epithelial suspensions representative of the antigenic and genomic variability within each serotype. Overall, the results provided evidence that the diagnostic performance of this assay platform is improved compared to the more complex polyclonal-based antigen detection ELISA; combining data from different serotypes and referring to the gold standard tests (i.e. virus isolation and/or RT-PCR), the MAbsmultiplex ELISA showed a sensitivity of 79% for the serotype-specific ELISA, compared to 72% for the polyclonal ELISA. The absence of reactivity of a minority of FMDV strains using the MAbsmultiplex ELISA can largely be attributed to deteriorated or low antigen concentration in the sample. This multiplex ELISA is simple, rapid and stable. FMDV antigenic diversity was adequately covered by the selected MAbs. Therefore, it can be used to replace existing polyclonal ELISAs for FMDV detection and serotyping.  2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2020

To address this need, several enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) platforms have been developed, however, these tests vary in their sensitivity and specificity and are very expensive for developing countries. Camelid-derived single-domain antibodies fragments so-called Nanobodies, have demonstrated great efficacy for the development of serological diagnostics. This study describes the development of a novel Nanobody-based FMD 3ABC competitive ELISA, for the serological detection of antibodies against FMD Non-Structural Proteins (NSP) in Uganda cattle herds. This in-house ELISA was validated using more than 600 sera from different Uganda districts, and virus serotype specificities. The evaluation of the performance of the assay demonstrated high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 94 % (95 % CI: 88.9-97.2), and 97.67 % (95 % CI: 94.15-99.36) respectively, as well as the capability to detect NSP-specific antibodies against multiple FMD serotype infections. In comparison with the commercial PrioCHECK FMDV NSP-FMD test, there was a strong concordance and high correlation and agreement in the performance of the two tests. This new developed Nanobody based FMD 3ABC competitive ELISA could clearly benefit routine disease diagnosis, the establishment of disease-free zones, and the improvement of FMD management and control in endemically complex environments, such as those found in Africa.  2018 Gelkop, Sobarzo, Brangel, Vincke, Romo, Fedida-Metula, Strom, Ataliba, Mwiine, Ochwo, Velazquez-Salinas, McKendry, Muyldermans, Lutwama, Rieder, Yavelsky and Lobel.",2018

Nevertheless, due to the observed variability in the antibody response to NSPs, the likelihood of screening or confirming the FMD infection status in animals is increased if an antibody profile to multiple NSPs is considered for diagnosis. In order to develop and evaluate an additional NSP-based diagnostic assay, in this study, the recombinant 3A protein of FMDV was expressed in Escherichia coli and used as an antigen for detection of FMD infection specific antibodies. At the fixed cut-off value of 45 percentage of positivity, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 3A indirect-ELISA (I-ELISA) were found to be 95.7% and 96.3%, respectively. In FMD naturally infected cattle, about 85% of clinically infected and 75% of asymptomatic in-contact populations were found positive at 13 months post-outbreak. The 3A I-ELISA was further evaluated with the bovine serum samples collected randomly from different parts of the country. Furthermore, the performance of newly developed 3A I-ELISA was compared with the extensively used in-house r3AB3 I-ELISA, and the overall concordance in test results was found to be 93.62%. The r3A I-ELISA could be useful as a screening or confirmatory assay in the sero-surveillance of FMD in India irrespective of extensive bi-annual vaccination.  2016 International Alliance for Biological Standardization.",2016

In India, since the launch of the FMD control programme, there has been a substantial increase in the vaccinated bovine population. In this scenario, there is a need for additional locally developed non-structural protein (NSP)-based immnoassays for efficient identification of FMD virus (FMDV)-infected animals in the vaccinated population. The 2B NSP of FMDV, lacking the transmembrane domain (<U+0394>2B), was expressed successfully in a prokaryotic system, and an indirect ELISA (I-ELISA) was developed and validated in this study. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the <U+0394>2B I-ELISA were found to be 95.3% and 94.6%, respectively. In experimentally infected cattle, the assay could consistently detect <U+0394>2B-NSP-specific antibodies from 10 to approximately 400 days postinfection. The assay was further validated with bovine serum samples collected randomly from different parts of the country. The performance of the <U+0394>2B I-ELISA was compared with the in-house r3AB3 I-ELISA, and the overall concordance in test results was found to be 86.49%.

In India, an endemic region practising preventive biannual vaccination, 3AB3 indirect ELISA (r3AB3 I-ELISA) has been employed as the primary screening test for serosurveillance. However, because of the variability observed in the immune response to the NSPs, the likelihood of detecting or confirming an infected animal is increased if an antibody profile against multiple NSPs is considered for diagnosis. In this study, all three copies of NSP 3B were expressed in a prokaryotic system to develop an indirect ELISA (r3B I-ELISA). At the decided cutoff of 40 percent positivity, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the r3B I-ELISA were estimated to be 92.1% (95% CI: 89.0-94.5) and 98.1% (95% CI: 96.9-98.8), respectively, as compared to 97.04% and 95.04% for r3AB3 I-ELISA. Although r3B I-ELISA displayed lower sensitivity compared to the screening assay, which could possibly be attributed to additional relevant B-cell epitopes in the carboxy-terminal half of the 3A protein, the former achieved considerably higher specificity on repeatedly vaccinated animals. NSP antibodies could be detected from 10 to as late as 998 days postinfection in experimental calves. Substantial agreement in the test results (90.6%) was found between the two ELISAs. The r3B I-ELISA, when used in conjunction with the r3AB3 I-ELISA as an integrated system, can potentially augment the efficiency and confidence of detection of infected herds against the backdrop of intensive vaccination.",2014

Animals in the endemic settings are regularly vaccinated in addition to intensive surveillance for control of the disease. Under intensive vaccination, detection of infected animals among the vaccinated population is essential to monitor the infection and to track down the virus movement. Sero-surveillance and retrospective disease diagnosis is performed primarily by detecting antibodies against non-structural proteins (NSPs) of FMD virus which are usually absent in the inactivated vaccine formulations. The study was conducted with an objective to compare simultaneously performance of six NSP ELISAs in detecting infected animals in the areas covered under intensive vaccination, and to assess their fit-for-purpose attribute for sero-surveillance of FMD in India. A panel of bovine serum samples consisting of samples collected from infected with FMDV, vaccinated and naive animals were constituted. In addition, samples collected at random from areas having varied FMD situation and vaccination coverage were tested simultaneously by the six NSP ELISAs to compare their performances. The four indigenous assays showed varying degrees of correlation with the two commercial kits. The study validated that, in all the groups of samples, the indigenous assays were equally sensitive and specific as the two commercial kits. Among all the six assays, PrioCheck and in-house 3ABC I-ELISAs showed maximum sensitivity for detection of infected animals, whereas 3AB3 I-ELISA and 3ABC C-ELISA showed maximum specificity. The study concluded that the in-house available assays are equally capable as the commercially available kits for differentiation of infected animals under intensive vaccination and identifies the 3AB3 I-ELISA with optimum sensitivity and specificity for the purpose of sero-surveillance in India.  2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014

Animals in the endemic settings are regularly vaccinated in addition to intensive surveillance for control of the disease. Under intensive vaccination, detection of infected animals among the vaccinated population is essential to monitor the infection and to track down the virus movement. Sero-surveillance and retrospective disease diagnosis is performed primarily by detecting antibodies against non-structural proteins (NSPs) of FMD virus which are usually absent in the inactivated vaccine formulations. The study was conducted with an objective to compare simultaneously performance of six NSP ELISAs in detecting infected animals in the areas covered under intensive vaccination, and to assess their fit-for-purpose attribute for sero-surveillance of FMD in India. A panel of bovine serum samples consisting of samples collected from infected with FMDV, vaccinated and naive animals were constituted. In addition, samples collected at random from areas having varied FMD situation and vaccination coverage were tested simultaneously by the six NSP ELISAs to compare their performances. The four indigenous assays showed varying degrees of correlation with the two commercial kits. The study validated that, in all the groups of samples, the indigenous assays were equally sensitive and specific as the two commercial kits. Among all the six assays, PrioCheck and in-house 3ABC I-ELISAs showed maximum sensitivity for detection of infected animals, whereas 3AB3 I-ELISA and 3ABC C-ELISA showed maximum specificity. The study concluded that the in-house available assays are equally capable as the commercially available kits for differentiation of infected animals under intensive vaccination and identifies the 3AB3 I-ELISA with optimum sensitivity and specificity for the purpose of sero-surveillance in India.  2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014

Transient post-vaccinal 3AB-Ab response could be detected in one of the three commercial vaccines during the six-month vaccination regimen, which emphasizes the fact that for a DIVA-compatible diagnostic strategy to be a realistic option, all vaccines need to be quality checked for the NSP content.  2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011

The study used cell culture grown antigens (1351 FMDV positive) derived from suspected cases of vesicular disease collected from 86 countries between 1924 and 2011, those positive for the other vesicular diseases of swine vesicular disease (n= 25) and vesicular stomatitis (n= 45) and negative samples collected from uninfected cell cultures (n= 36). The diagnostic sensitivity of the assays was similar at 98.1% (polyclonal ELISA) compared to 97.9% (integrin/Mab ELISA) but the serotypic-specificity of the latter was vastly superior (96%) to that of the former (61.5%). Reactions with the viruses of swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis, which produce clinically indistinguishable syndromes in pigs and cattle, did not occur. The integrin/Mab ELISA recognized FMDV strains of wide antigenic and molecular diversity of all seven serotypes and although some FMDV isolates were not detected, the greater specificity of the assay, while retaining test sensitivity comparable to the conventional assay, warrants its consideration for adoption for routine diagnostic use.  2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011

Since none of the tests could be considered as a proper reference test and for about half of the tested sera the true status (sero-converted or not for non-structural proteins, i.e. presence of antibodies) of the animals was unknown, a Bayesian analysis employing a latent class model was used that did not rely on the use of a reference test or gold standard.

The specificity of the six tests for vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle ranged from 96 to 99%.

This assay simultaneously screens for five RNA and two DNA viruses by using multiplexed reverse transcription-PCR (mRT-PCR) amplification coupled with a microsphere hybridization array and flow-cytometric detection. Two of the 17 primer-probe sets included in this multiplex assay were adopted from previously characterized real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays for FMDV. The diagnostic accuracy of the mRT-PCR assay was evaluated using 287 field samples, including 247 samples (213 true-positive samples and 35 true-negative samples) from suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease collected from 65 countries between 1965 and 2006 and 39 true-negative samples collected from healthy animals. The mRT-PCR assay results were compared to those of two singleplex rRT-PCR assays, using virus isolation with antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as the reference method. The diagnostic sensitivity of the mRT-PCR assay for FMDV was 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.8 to 96.4%), and the sensitivity was 98.1% (95% CI, 95.3 to 99.3%) for the two singleplex rRT-PCR assays used in combination. In addition, the assay could reliably differentiate between FMDV and other vesicular viruses, such as swine vesicular disease virus and vesicular exanthema of swine virus. Interestingly, the mRT-PCR detected parapoxvirus (n = 2) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (n = 2) in clinical samples, demonstrating the screening potential of this mRT-PCR assay to identify viruses in FMDV-negative material not previously recognized by using focused single-target rRT-PCR assays.

The kinetics of the antibody response to NSPs was compared on sequential serum samples in swine from challenge studies and outbreaks. The results showed that ELISA A (UBI) and ELISA B (CEDI) had better sensitivity than that of the 3ABC recombinant protein-based ELISA C (Chekit). The peak for detection of antibodies to NSPs in ELISA C was significantly delayed in sera from natural infection and challenged swine as compared to the ELISA A and B. The sensitivity of the three ELISAs gradually declined during the 6-month post-infection as antibodies to NSP decline. ELISA kits A and B detected NSP antibody in 50% of challenged pigs by the 9-10th-day and 7-8th-day post-challenge, respectively. ELISA B and C had better specificity than ELISA A on sequential serum samples obtained from swine immunized with a type O FMD vaccine commercially available in Taiwan. Antibody to NSPs before vaccination was not detected in swine not exposed to FMD virus, however, antibody to NSPs was found in sera of some pigs after vaccination. All assays had significantly lower specificity when testing sera from repeatedly vaccinated sows and finishers in 1997 that were tested after the 1997 FMD outbreak. However, when testing sera from repeatedly vaccinated sows or finishers in 2003-2004, the specificity for ELISAs A, B and C were significantly better than those in 1997.

We compared antibody kinetics to non-structural proteins, sensitivity, and specificity. One of the ELISAs had a higher sensitivity and much lower specificity than the other two, therefore we established standardised cutoff values for the compared assays using receiver operated characteristic (ROC) curves. Using the standardised cutoff values, all three ELISAs produced comparable results with respect to sensitivity and specificity. Antibody development to non-structural proteins after infection and after vaccination/infection was not significantly different. Development of antibodies, however, both neutralising and directed to non-structural proteins, was significantly delayed after intranasal inoculation as compared to intradermolingual infection. Based on results of sera obtained after vaccination and experimental infection all three assays can be used for testing sera collected between 4 weeks and 6 months after infection. More information is needed on the prevalence of positive reactors in a situation where emergency vaccination has been used and FMD transmission was still observed.  2004 Elsevier B.V.

As there is currently no vaccine and effective treatment methods. Therefore, early monitoring is one of the most important solutions to prevent and control ASF. In this study, the dual QDM recombinant virus protein 30 and 54 (P30 and P54) probes and pre-incubation in vitro were proposed for the first time as QDM based-ASFV immunosensor (QAIS) for the ultra-sensitive quantitative detection of ASFV antibodies in serum. In the range from serum dilution of 1:1000 to 1:64000, it showed a good linear relationship (R2 = 0.9947), and its detection sensitivity was 1:64000 dilution. Compared with commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and colloidal gold immunochromatographic strip (CGICS), its detection sensitivity was improved by at least one order of magnitude and four orders of magnitude respectively. In addition, the whole ASFV antibody screening test can be completed in 25 min with simple operation. The performance and practicability of the established QAIS sensor have been verified by ASF-ELISA kit, and its coincidence rate was as high as 98.7% in 151 clinical samples. We firmly believe that the proposed QAIS sensor could potentially be applied to point-of-care testing (POCT) for quantitative ASFV antibody in pig farms.  2021",2022

The disease is endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa and Sardinia. Since 2007, it has also been present in different countries of Eastern Europe, where control measures have not been effective so far. The continued spread poses a serious threat to the swine industry worldwide. In the absence of vaccine, early detection of infected animals is of paramount importance for control of the outbreak, to prevent the transmission of the virus to healthy animals and subsequent spreading of the disease. Current laboratory diagnosis is mainly based on virological methods (antigen and genome detection) and serodiagnosis. Results: In the present work, a Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) for antigen detection has been developed and evaluated. The test is based on the use of a MAb against VP72 protein of ASFV, the major viral capsid protein and highly immunogenic. First experiments using VP72 viral and recombinant protein or inactivated culture virus showed promising results with a sensitivity similar to that of a commercially available Antigen-ELISA. Moreover, these strips were tested with blood from experimentally infected pigs and field animals and the results compared with those of PCR and Antigen-ELISA. For the experimentally infected samples, there was an excellent correlation between the LFA and the ELISA, while the PCR always showed to be more sensitive (38 % positive samples by PCR versus 27 % by LFA). The LFA was demonstrated to be positive for animals with circulating virus levels exceeding 104 HAU. With the field samples, once again, the PCR detected more positives than either the Antigen-ELISA or LFA, although here the number of positive samples scored by the LFA exceeded the values obtained with the Antigen-ELISA, showing 60 % positivity vs 48 % for the ELISA. For the two groups of sera, the specificity was close to 100 % indicating that hardly any false positive samples were found. Conclusions: The newly developed LFA allows rapid and reliable detection of ASFV, at field and laboratory level, providing a new useful tool for control programs and in situations where laboratory support and skilled personnel are limited.  2016 The Author(s).",2016

Special features of the course of (ASF and its forms should be considered for the effective use of various ASF diagnostic methods aimed at the pathogen or specific antibody identification. ASF diagnosis in the wild boar is of special importance. The wild boar susceptibility to ASF virus is well known, and the disease has been repeatedly reproduced in experiments and detected in European wild boars in natural conditions. It is not unfrequently that when shooting wild boars, only organ samples are delivered to laboratories, so we decided to estimate the diagnostic value of the antibodies detected in tissues and evaluate an earlier developed test system for its efficacy when used for the assay. This report represents the results of validation of an indirect ELISA (a commercial kit VNIIVViM ASF-ELISA Ab/Ag) ASF virus specific antibody detection in blood serum and spleen tissue extracts. For comparison, an indirect immunofluorescence assay (indirect IFA) was used. To estimate the obtained results, ROC analysis was applied. Examination of positive (n = 66) and negative (n = 410) porcine blood serum samples using indirect ELISA showed high sensitivity and specificity of the method with reference to IFA. Among the 476 serum samples examined in indirect ELISA, only 8 sera (1.6 %) were within the positive/negative cutoff area. The highest sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (99.27 %) for indirect ELISA when examining both domestic pig and wild boar blood sera were determined at a cutoff value of 0.264. The samples of spleen extracts to be used for the study were collected from clinically healthy wild boars in ASF-affected Smolensk region in 2013 to 2014. In view of an acute form of the disease, we can suspect that the animals exhibiting positive reaction were in a latency period of the pathogeny. When examining the positive (n = 59) and negative (n = 678) spleen extracts, we also determined high sensitivity and specificity levels of indirect ELISA with reference to indirect IFA. Among the samples examined (n = 737), 10 (1.3 %) samples of spleen extracts were within the positive/negative cutoff area.

The early appearance and subsequent long-term persistence of antibodies combined with cost-effectiveness make antibody detection techniques essential in control programmes. Recent reports appear to indicate that the serological tests recommended by the OIE for ASF monitoring are much less effective in East and Southern Africa where viral genetic and antigenic diversity is the greatest. We report herein an extensive analysis including more than 1000 field and experimental infection sera, in which the OIE recommended tests are compared with antigen-specific ELISAs and immuno-peroxidase staining of cells (IPT). The antibody detection results generated using new antigen-specific tests, developed in this study, which are based on production of antigen fractions generated by infection and virus purification from COS-1 cells, showed strong concordance with the OIE tests. We therefore conclude that the lack of success is not attributable to antigenic polymorphism and may be related to the specific characteristics of the local breeds African pigs.  2012 Elsevier B.V.",2013

Primers and a TaqMan  probe specific for ASFV were selected from conserved regions of the p72 gene. The limit of detection of the new real-time PCR assay is 5.7-57 copies of the ASFV genome. High accuracy, reproducibility and robustness of the PCR assay (CV ranging from 0.7 to 5.4%) were demonstrated both within and between laboratories using different real-time PCR equipments. The specificity of virus detection was validated using a panel of 44 isolates collected over many years in various geographical locations in Europe, Africa and America, including recent isolates from the Caucasus region, Sardinia, East and West Africa. Compared to the OIE-prescribed conventional and real-time PCR assays, the sensitivity of the new assay with internal control was improved, as demonstrated by testing 281 field samples collected in recent outbreaks and surveillance areas in Europe and Africa (170 samples) together with samples obtained through experimental infections (111 samples). This is particularly evident in the early days following experimental infection and during the course of the disease in pigs sub-clinically infected with strains of low virulence (from 35 up to 70dpi). The specificity of the assay was also confirmed on 150 samples from uninfected pigs and wild boar from ASF-free areas. Measured on the total of 431 tested samples, the positive deviation of the new assay reaches 21% or 26% compared to PCR and real-time PCR methods recommended by OIE. This improved and rigorously validated real-time PCR assay with internal control will provide a rapid, sensitive and reliable molecular tool for ASFV detection in pigs in newly infected areas, control in endemic areas and surveillance in ASF-free areas.  2011 Elsevier B.V.",2011

There is no vaccine, and so reliable diagnosis is essential for control strategies. The performance of four recombinant ASF virus (ASFV) protein (pK205R, pB602L, p104R, and p54)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) was evaluated with European porcine field sera that had been established by Office International des Epizooties (OIE)-approved tests to be ASFV negative (n = 119) and ASFV positive (n = 80). The <U+03BA> values showed that there was almost perfect agreement between the results of the ""gold standard"" test (immunoblotting) and the results obtained by the p54-specific ELISA (<U+03BA> 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 0.99) and the pK205R-specific ELISA or the pB602L-specific ELISA (<U+03BA> 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.97). For the pA104R-specific ELISA, there was substantial to almost perfect agreement (<U+03BA> 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.89). Similar results were observed by the OIE-approved ELISA (<U+03BA> 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.95). Importantly, antibodies against these proteins were detectable early after infection of domestic pigs. Preliminary testing of 9 positive and 17 negative serum samples from pigs from West Africa showed identical results by the recombinant protein-based ELISA and the OIE-approved tests. In contrast, there was a high degree of specificity but a surprisingly a low level of sensitivity with 7 positive and 342 negative serum samples from pigs from East Africa. With poorly preserved sera, only the p104R-specific ELISA showed a significant reduction in sensitivity compared to that of the OIE-approved ELISA. Finally, these recombinant proteins also detected antibodies in the sera of the majority of infected warthogs. Thus, recombinant ASFV proteins p54, pB602L, and pK205R provide sensitive and specific targets for the detection of antibodies in European and West African domestic pigs and warthogs.

Such validation included the following: (i) the scaling up and standardization of p30r production and the associated immunoassays, (ii) a broad immunological analysis using a large number of samples (a total of 672) from Spain and different African locations, and (iii) the detection of the ASF virus (ASFV)-antibody responses at different times after experimental infection. Yields of p30r reached up to 15% of the total protein recovered from the infected larvae at 3 days postinfection. Serological analysis of samples collected in Spain revealed that the p30r-based ELISA presented similar sensitivity to and higher specificity than the conventional Office International des Epizooties-approved ASFV ELISA. Moreover, the p30r ELISA was more sensitive than the conventional ELISA test in detecting ASFV-specific antibodies in experimentally infected animals at early times postinfection. Both the recombinant and conventional ELISAs presented variable rates of sensitivity and specificity with African samples, apparently related to their geographical origin. Comparative analyses performed on the sequences, predicted structures, and antigenicities of p30 proteins from different Spanish and African isolates suggested that variability among isolates might correlate with changes in antigenicity, thus affecting detection by the p30r ELISA. Our estimations indicate that more than 40,000 ELISA determinations and 2,000 confirmatory immunoblotting tests can be performed with the p30r protein obtained from a single infected larva, making this a feasible and inexpensive strategy for production of serological tests with application in developing countries.

The Se and Sp of real-time RT-PCR were estimated as 97.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 95.2-98.8%) and 71.7% (95% CI = 65-77.9%) respectively. The Se and Sp of histopathology were estimated as 94.6% (95% CI = 91-97.2%) and 92.3% (95% CI = 87.6-95.8%), respectively. The Se and Sp of IHC were estimated as 97.6% (95% CI = 93.9-99.8%) and 99.4% (95% CI = 96.9-100%), respectively. Decreased Sp of real-time RT-PCR was ascribed to cross-contamination of samples. Stratified analysis of the data suggested variations in test accuracy with fetuses and severely autolyzed specimens. The Sp of histopathology in fetuses (83%) was 9.3% lower than the sample population (92.3%). The Se of IHC decreased from 97.6% to 81.5% in the presence of severe autolysis. The diagnostic Se and Sp of histopathology was higher than expected, confirming the value of routine postmortem examinations and histopathology of liver specimens. Aborted fetuses, however, should be screened using a variety of tests in areas endemic for RVF, and results from severely autolyzed specimens should be interpreted with caution. The most feasible testing option for countries lacking suitably equipped laboratories seems to be routine histology in combination with IHC.  2014 The Author(s).",2014

A total of 3055 sera from sheep (n = 1 159), goats (n = 636), cattle (n = 203), African buffalo (n = 928), and other wild ruminants (n = 129), including eland, kudu, and black wildebeest, was used. Sera from domestic ruminants were collected in West (n = 10), South (n = 1 654) and East Africa (n = 334), and sera from wild ruminants (n = 1 064) were collected in South Africa. In addition, 136 sera from eight experimentally RVFV-infected sheep, taken during a period of 28 days post infection (dpi), were used to study the kinetics of RVFV antibody production. Field sera were tested by the serum neutralization (VN) test and experimental sera by VN and haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. Based on VN test results, negative sera were regarded as reference controls from RVFV-free, and positive sera were regarded as reference controls from RVFV-infected subpopulations of animals. ELISA data were expressed as the percentage positivity (PP) of an internal high positive control. The two-graph receiver operating characteristics approach was used for the selection and optimization of I-ELISA cut-offs including the misclassification costs term and Youden index (J). In addition, cut-off values were determined as the mean plus two-fold standard deviation of the result observed with the RVFV-free subpopulations. Established optimal cut-offs were different for each of the data sets analyzed, and ranged from 1.65 PP (buffalo) to 9.1 PP (goats). At the cut-off giving the highest estimate of combined measure of diagnostic accuracy (highest J value), the I-ELISA test parameters were determined as follows: (1) Diagnostic sensitivity (%): cattle - 84.31, buffalo - 94.44, sheep - 98.91, goats - 99.18 (2) Diagnostic specificity (%): cattle - 99.34, buffalo - 98.28, sheep - 99.16, goats - 99.23 and other game ruminants - 99.26 In the group of RVFV-experimentally infected sheep, seroconversion in all individuals was detected by VN on 4-6 dpi, by HI on 5-7 dpi, and by I-ELISA on 6-7 dpi. All tests showed the same kinetic pattern of immunological response. Antibody levels were low for a very short period before increasing to high titres, after which it was easily detectable by all tests. Compared to traditional tests, the lower sensitivity of I-ELISA in the detection of the earliest stage of immunological response may be practically insignificant, particularly when this assay is used in population-based, disease-surveillance programmes. The high sensitivity and specificity of I-ELISA established in this study, especially for the statistically more representative subpopulations of animals tested, seem to support this prediction.

Rapid and reliable assays are therefore essential for the confirmation of clinical diagnoses and to enable control strategies to be implemented without undue delay. One of the major objectives of a recent European Union funded project was the validation of newly developed diagnostic assays which are rapid, sensitive, highly reproducible and inexpensive, for the detection of African horse sickness virus (AHSV) antigens and antibodies. The Laboratorio de Sanidad y Produccion Animal (LSPA) in Algete, Spain was charged with the responsibility of co-ordinating and supplying samples of viruses and antisera to the participating laboratories in Spain, France and the United Kingdom. The panels comprised 76 antigen samples for assay by indirect sandwich ELISAs and 53 serum samples for antibody detection by either indirect or competitive ELISAs. Results generated by ELISA for each laboratory were analysed in LSPA in terms of their relative sensitivities and specificities. There was a good agreement between the ELISAs used for either antigen or antibody detection. The participating groups agreed that any field sample giving a doubtful result would always be retested by ELISA and an alternative assay.",1998

Although vaccination and other control measures have been carried out, it is essential to establish a rapid and valid method for CSF vaccination monitoring and clinical diagnosis. The CSFV E2 protein has been widely used as a major antigen for antibody detection. It is important to improve the affinity between the E2 protein and CSFV antibodies to improve the performance of the detection method. In this study, a recombinant E2 extracellular protein (amino acids 1331) with a native homodimer conformation and high affinity for the anti-CSFV-E2 monoclonal antibody WH303 was expressed using a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. A novel immunochromatographic test strip based on the recombinant CSFV E2 protein was developed for CSFV antibody detection. The sensitivity of this strip for detecting CSFV standard-positive serum was 1:102400, four times higher than that of the previously developed CnC2 test strip. No cross-reactivity with antibodies of other swine viruses was observed. Detection of clinical swine serum samples (n=813) demonstrated that the agreements of this E2 test strip with three commercial ELISA kits were 97.17% (790/813), 95.94% (780/813) and 93.73% (762/813), respectively.

For the evaluation of the established real-time PCR, 34 clinical samples were assessed by both the A137R gene-based real-time PCR and OIE-recommended TaqMan PCR. The results showed that 85.29% (29/34) were detected by A137R gene-based real-time PCR, but only 79.41% (27/34) positive using OIE-recommended TaqMan PCR. Moreover, no cross-reaction with other common swine pathogens was found in the A137R gene-based real-time PCR. These results demonstrated that the established real-time PCR assay in this study showed better performance than the OIE-recommended method in detecting ASFV from clinical samples, which could be applied for control and eradication programs of ASF.

This study compared sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (S-ELISA) and conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the diagnosis of FMD. Methods: A total of 60 epithelial samples from suspected cases of FMD were tested using both S-ELISA and RT-PCR assays. The level of agreement between the assays was assessed by calculating the Kappa value. Results: S-ELISA detected 38 (63%) samples positive for FMD virus (FMDV).

Although transmission of FMDV from carrier cattle to nave cattle has not been demonstrated experimentally, circumstantial evidence from field studies has linked FMDV-carrier cattle to cause subsequent out-breaks. Therefore, the asymptomatic carrier state complicates the control and eradication of FMD. Current serological diagnosis using tests for antibodies to the viral non-structural proteins (NSP-ELISA) are not sensitive enough to detect all carrier animals, if persistently infected after vaccination and do not distinguish between carriers and non-carriers. The specificity of the NSP ELISA may also be reduced after vaccination, in particular after multiple vaccination. FMDV-specific mucosal antibodies (IgA) are not produced in vaccinated cattle but are elevated transiently during the acute phase of infection and can be detected at a high level in cattle persistently infected with FMDV, irrespective of their vaccination status. Therefore, detection of IgA by ELISA may be considered a diagnostic alternative to RT-PCR for assessing FMDV persistent infection in ruminants in both vaccinated and unvaccinated infected populations. This study reports on the development and validation of a new mucosal IgA ELISA for the detection of carrier animals using nasal, saliva, and oropharyngeal fluid (OPF) samples. The diagnostic performance of the IgA ELISA using nasal samples from experimentally vaccinated and infected cattle demonstrated a high level of specificity (99%) and an improved level of sensitivity (76.5%). Furthermore, the detection of carrier animals reached 96.9% when parallel testing of samples was carried out using both the IgA-ELISA and NSP-ELISA.  2021 by the authors.

FMD vaccines are mainly comprised of inactivated virions and stimulate protective antibodies to virus structural proteins. In contrast, infection with FMD virus leads to virus replication and additional antibody responses to viral nonstructural proteins (NSP). Therefore, antibodies against NSPs are used to differentiate infection in vaccinated animals (DIVA), in order to estimate the prevalence of infection or its absence. Another advantage of NSP antibody tests is that they detect FMD infection in the field, irrespective of the serotypes of virus in circulation. In cattle, the NSP tests that target the 3ABC polyprotein provides the highest sensitivity, detecting up to 90% of vaccinated animals that become carriers after exposure to infection, with a specificity of around 99%. Due to insufficient diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, detection of a low level of infection is difficult at the population level with a high degree of confidence. The low level of non-specific responses can be overcome by retesting samples scored positive using a second confirmatory test, which should have at least comparable sensitivity to the first test. In this study, six in-house tests were developed incorporating different NSP antigens, and validated using bovine sera from nave animals, field cases and experimentally vaccinated and/or infected animals. In addition, two (short and long incubation) new commercial NSP tests based on 3ABC competitive blocking ELISAs (ID Screen FMD NSP Competition, IDvet, France) were validated in this study. The two commercial ELISAs had very similar sensitivities and specificities that were not improved by lengthening the incubation period. Several of the new in-house tests had performance characteristics that were nearly as good as the commercial ELISAs. Finally, the in-house tests were evaluated for use as confirmatory tests following screening with the PrioCHECK and ID Screen FMDV NS commercial kits, to assess the diagnostic performance produced by a multiple testing strategy. The in-house tests could be used in series (to confirm) or in parallel (to augment) with the PrioCHECK and IDvet FMDV NS commercial kits, in order to improve either the specificity or sensitivity of the overall test system, although this comes at the cost of a reduction in the counterpart (sensitivity/specificity) parameter.  2021 by the authors.

FMD vaccines are mainly comprised of inactivated virions and stimulate protective antibodies to virus structural proteins. In contrast, infection with FMD virus leads to virus replication and additional antibody responses to viral nonstructural proteins (NSP). Therefore, antibodies against NSPs are used to differentiate infection in vaccinated animals (DIVA), in order to estimate the prevalence of infection or its absence. Another advantage of NSP antibody tests is that they detect FMD infection in the field, irrespective of the serotypes of virus in circulation. In cattle, the NSP tests that target the 3ABC polyprotein provides the highest sensitivity, detecting up to 90% of vaccinated animals that become carriers after exposure to infection, with a specificity of around 99%. Due to insufficient diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, detection of a low level of infection is difficult at the population level with a high degree of confidence. The low level of non-specific responses can be overcome by retesting samples scored positive using a second confirmatory test, which should have at least comparable sensitivity to the first test. In this study, six in-house tests were developed incorporating different NSP antigens, and validated using bovine sera from nave animals, field cases and experimentally vaccinated and/or infected animals. In addition, two (short and long incubation) new commercial NSP tests based on 3ABC competitive blocking ELISAs (ID Screen FMD NSP Competition, IDvet, France) were validated in this study. The two commercial ELISAs had very similar sensitivities and specificities that were not improved by lengthening the incubation period. Several of the new in-house tests had performance characteristics that were nearly as good as the commercial ELISAs. Finally, the in-house tests were evaluated for use as confirmatory tests following screening with the PrioCHECK and ID Screen FMDV NS commercial kits, to assess the diagnostic performance produced by a multiple testing strategy. The in-house tests could be used in series (to confirm) or in parallel (to augment) with the PrioCHECK and IDvet FMDV NS commercial kits, in order to improve either the specificity or sensitivity of the overall test system, although this comes at the cost of a reduction in the counterpart (sensitivity/specificity) parameter.  2021 by the authors.

The PPRV N-terminal immunogenic region (1266 aa) of nucleoprotein (NPN) coding sequence was amplified and cloned into the pETite vector. The rPPRV-NPN with a molecular weight of ~ 30 kDa was expressed in E. coli, purified, and characterized by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using standard PPRV specific sera. The Ni-NTA affinity-purified rPPRV-NPN as coating antigen and its hyperimmune serum as competitive antibodies raised in guinea pigs were evaluated as diagnostic reagents in ABrC-ELISA using the known standard panel of sera. The threshold (cut-off) Percentage Inhibition (PI) value was determined as 45 (mean  3 SD) based on the reactivity of the known sheep and goats sera to PPRV antibodies [negative (n = 140) and positive (n = 98)] and the assay had a sensitivity of 97 % (95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 91.399.4 %) and specificity of 100 % (95 % CI: 97.4100 %) with an excellent Area under curve (AUC) of 0.997 (95 % CI: 0.991.0). On evaluation of diagnostic performance of the assay using the sheep and goats sera (n = 391) from vaccinated, infected, and non-vaccinated animals, the ABrC-ELISA showed the relative diagnostic sensitivity of 95.88 % (95 % CI: 92.5698.01 %) & 98.77 % (95 % CI: 96.4399.74 %) and diagnostic specificity of 97.97 % (95 % CI: 94.1999.58 %) & 90.54 % (95 % CI: 84.6494.73 %) against indigenous PPR competitive ELISA kit & IDvet Screen PPR Competition kit, respectively. The study showed that ABrC-ELISA is rapid, sensitive, and specific and can be a better alternative assay for the detection of the PPRV antibodies in the sera of small ruminants for serosurveillance / seromonitoring of PPR not only at the eradication and post-eradication phases in the disease-controlled endemic countries but also in the PPR non-endemic countries.  2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021
