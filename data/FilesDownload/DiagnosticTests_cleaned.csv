In this study, a commercial rapid immuno-chromatographic method or Lateral Flow Test (LFT) device, for the detection of BT virus-specific antibodies in animal serum, was evaluated in an international inter laboratory proficiency test. The evaluation was done with sera samples of variable background (ruminant species, serotype, field samples, experimental infections, vaccinated animals). The diagnostic sensitivity was 100% (95% C.I. [90.5-100]) and the diagnostic specificity was 95.2% (95% C.I. [76.2-99.9]). The repeatability (accordance) and reproducibility (concordance) were 100% for seropositive samples but were lower for two of the seronegative samples (45% and 89% respectively). The analytical sensitivity, evaluated by testing positive sera at increasing dilutions was better for the BT LFT compared to some commercial ELISAs. Seroconversion of an infected sheep was detected at 4 days post infection. Analytical specificity was impaired by cross-reactions observed with some of the samples seropositive for Epizootic Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (EHDV). The agreement (Cohen's kappa) between the LFT and a commercial BT competitive ELISA was 0.79 (95% CI [0.62-0.95]). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the BT LFT device is a rapid and sensitive first-line serological test that can be used in the field, especially in areas endemic for the disease where there is a lack of diagnostic facilities.

The current paper describes the development of a neutralization test using plasma and addresses the factors critical for detection of neutralizing antibodies against BTV serotype 8 (BTV-8), such as virus propagation, stability of virus infectivity and origin of the BTV-8 strain. The results indicated that animals exposed to the Northern European BTV-8 strain developed low neutralizing antibody titers, particularly after vaccination and experimental infection. Although clearly ELISA-positive, these samples often yielded false negative results when tested by the neutralization test using the OIE recommended virus concentration of 100 TCID50/50 mu l. The sensitivity of the neutralization test could be improved significantly with retained specificity by using a reduced TCID50 and the homologous European BTV-8 strain instead of the South African reference strain.

Niedbalski","Evaluation of commercial ELISA kits for the detection of antibodies against bluetongue virus","The aim of this study was to estimate the diagnostic value of different commercially available ELISA kits for the detection of bluetongue virus (BTV) antibodies in infected and vaccinated animals. The relative specificity of ELISA kits was evaluated using a panel of sera originating from healthy cattle, never vaccinated nor exposed to BTV. All ELISA kits applied had a high relative specificity (99.3 - 100%). The relative sensitivity of ELISA kits assessed using a panel of sera collected from BTV infected cattle was also high and similar for all the kits (97.3 - 100%). However, the relative sensitivity evaluated on the basis of testing vaccinated animals was different: the highest sensitivity was found for Ingenasa, PrioCHECK and ID VET ELISAs (96.5 - 98.3%). Slightly lower sensitivity was calculated for Pourquier and LSI kits (82.8% and 85.4%, respectively) and much lower sensitivity was found for VMRD ELISA kit (69.5%). The repeatability of BTV ELISA kits was expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV) of results of sera tested 5 times in the same day and in different days by the period of 2 months, by the same person, in the same conditions, and by using the same equipment. The CVs of sera tested in all ELISA kits ranged from 6.1 to 9.8% and were below 10% threshold adopted as a maximum for the acceptable repeatability of the method. In conclusion, it can be stated that the applied ELISA kits can be a valuable diagnostic tool for the serological monitoring studies in the BTV contaminated premises. All the methods are very specific and sensitive when testing BTV infected animals.

The relative specificity of ELISA kits was evaluated using a panel of sera originating from healthy cattle, never vaccinated nor exposed to BTV. All ELISA kits applied had a high relative specificity (99.3 - 100%). The relative sensitivity of ELISA kits assessed using a panel of sera collected from BTV infected cattle was also high and similar for all the kits (97.3 - 100%). However, the relative sensitivity evaluated on the basis of testing vaccinated animals was different: the highest sensitivity was found for Ingenasa, PrioCHECK and ID VET ELISAs (96.5 - 98.3%). Slightly lower sensitivity was calculated for Pourquier and LSI kits (82.8% and 85.4%, respectively) and much lower sensitivity was found for VMRD ELISA kit (69.5%). The repeatability of BTV ELISA kits was expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV) of results of sera tested 5 times in the same day and in different days by the period of 2 months, by the same person, in the same conditions, and by using the same equipment. The CVs of sera tested in all ELISA kits ranged from 6.1 to 9.8% and were below 10% threshold adopted as a maximum for the acceptable repeatability of the method.

However, the relative sensitivity evaluated on the basis of testing of vaccinated animals was different for the used ELISAs: the LSI, ID VET and Ingenasa kits had a high sensitivity (85.2-98.2%) but the sensitivity of VMRD ELISA was much lower (68.6%). The repeatability of ELISAs was expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV) of results of sera tested 5 times in the same day and 10 times in different days through the period of 2 months, by the same person, in the same conditions, and by using of the same equipment. The CVs of sera tested in Ingenasa and ID VET kits ranged from 6.1 to 9.8% and were below the 10% threshold adopted as a maximal for the acceptable repeatability of a method. In conclusion, it can be stated that the applied ELISAs can be a valuable diagnostic tool for the serological monitoring studies in the BTV infected premises. Nevertheless, the Ingenasa and ID VET ELISAs can be the most useful in sero-surveillance of livestock following vaccination.",2010

Reliable diagnostic tools are essential in controlling BT but data on the diagnostic sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) are often missing. This paper aims to describe and analyse the results obtained with the diagnostics used in Belgium during the 2006 BT crisis. The diagnosis was based on a combination of antibody detection (competitive ELISA, cELISA) and viral RNA detection by real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). The performance of the cELISA as a diagnostic tool was assessed on field results obtained during the epidemic and previous surveillance campaigns. As the infectious status of the animals is unknown during an epidemic, a Bayesian analysis was performed. Both assays were found to be equally specific (RT-qPCR: 98.5%; cELISA: 98.2%) while the diagnostic sensitivity of the RT-qPCR (99.5%) was superior to that of the cELISA (87.8%). The assumption of RT-qPCR as standard of comparison during the blue-tongue virus (BTV) epidemic proved valid based on the results of the Bayesian analysis. A ROC analysis of the cELISA, using RT-qPCR as standard of comparison, showed that the cut-off point with the highest accuracy occurred at a percentage negativity of 66, which is markedly higher than the cut-off proposed by the manufacturer. The analysis of the results was further extended to serological and molecular profiling and the possible use of profiling as a rapid epidemiological marker of the BTV in-field situation was assessed. A comparison of the serological profiles obtained before, during and at the end of the Belgian epidemic clearly showed the existence of an intermediate zone which appears soon after BTV (re)enters the population.

To develop a specific diagnostic method, monoclonal antibody (Mab) against VP7 was prepared and investigated as diagnostic reagent with the baculovirus expressed VP7. However, the Mab against VP7 of AHSV cross-reacted with Chuzan virus by the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), confirming the presence of conserved domain of VP7 among Orbiviruses. This study describes two types of ELISA; Mab linked indirect (I-ELISA) and competitive-ELISA (C-ELISA) using baculovirus expressed VP7 as an antigen. These ELISAs were compared for serodiagnosis of AHSV showing that C-ELISA was more specific than I-ELISA. The results indicated that C-ELISA is applicable to serodiagnosis of AHSV regardless of serotypes. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2003

We sampled one bighorn sheep population four times between 1989 and 1995. The tests evaluated included virus isolation (VI), polymerase-chain reaction (PCR), serum neutralization (SN), agar-gel immunodiffusion (AGID), and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA). The c-ELISA, AGID and SN tests had high levels of agreement in determining serogroup exposure in bighorn sheep. We used maximum-likelihood algorithms to estimate the parameters of each diagnostic test used. Although the c-ELISA and AGID had high sensitivity and specificity, the SN had perfect specificity but lower apparent sensitivity. Due to the potential of cross-reactions among multiple serotypes, results of the SN must be interpreted with caution when assessing serotype exposure in an area where multiple serotypes an endemic. The PCR assay delineated convalescent antibody titers from more-recent infections, and consequently, was pivotal in distinguishing a different exposure pattern between the bighorn sheep and cattle in an adjacent herd. Based on an increasing seroprevalence (50% to 100%), BTV circulated through this bighorn sheep population between 1989 and 1993, This increase in seroprevalence coincided with a bighorn die-off due to BTV infection in June, 1991. An adjacent cattle herd was sampled in 1995 for comparison. The bighorn sheep and adjacent cattle had different patterns of exposure to BTV between 1994 and 1995. There was no evidence that BTV circulated through the bighorn sheep population from 1994 to 1995. In 1995, seroprevalence to BTV decreased to 72%, none of yearling bighorn was seropositive, and all of the 39 bighorn sheep were PCR-negative. In contrast, all adult cattle were seropositive to BTV by c-ELISA and SN, and 4 of the calves were seropositive; 11 of the 24 cattle were PCR-positive, including all five calves. Overall, the pattern of temporal herd immunity in the bighorn sheep appeared to follow a classic epidemic curve, with the appearance and subsequent disappearance of herd immunity coinciding with the 1991 die-off in this population. As low levels of herd immunity and high proportions of susceptible animals are key factors in the development of epidemics, this population of bighorn sheep may be at increased risk for a BTV epidemic in the future.

Antibodies were detected in both llamas by 1 wk or 2 wk post-infection. Antibodies to BTV increased exponentially during the first 4 wk in both llamas and stabilized at an elevated level during the remaining 5-wk-period of the experiment. We evaluated the C-ELISA for 1,442 field sera from bluetongue-free areas, collected from 398 llamas in New Zealand as well as 451 elk (Cervus elaphus canadensis), 323 bison (Bison bison) and 270 reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in Canada. Based an the frequency distribution of the C-ELISA values, we propose that the current negative cut-off value of 50% inhibition established for bovine held sera also can be applied to the sera from these wild ruminants. The C-ELISA values for other wild ruminant field sera collected in bluetongue-free areas of Canada from 98 native caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), 32 white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), 14 moose (Alces alces), and nine muskoxen (Ovibos maschatus) and 15 yak (Bos grunniens) also were less than 50%, with the exception of three caribou samples. Based on our results, we propose that the C-ELISA be used as a rapid and specific test for serodiagnosis of BTV infection in llamas and possibly other wild ruminants.",1995

Statistical analysis of the data showed close agreement between the two techniques (K = 0.92). The ELISA gave a higher specificity, positive predictive value and efficiency than the VN test.

Three of the ponies died suddenly after showing mild clinical signs, the fourth pony remained clinically normal and was killed at day 38. Infectious AHSV was isolated from blood samples collected at intervals from all four ponies. Positive antigen ELISA reactions were only observed with blood samples from two of the ponies on the two days preceding death. Specific AHSV antibodies were detected by ELISA in serum samples from the other two ponies although one eventually died. African horse sickness viral antigens were detected by ELISA in post-mortem tissue samples collected from all four ponies. No infectious virus could be detected in tissue samples taken post-mortem from the pony which survived African horse sickness (AHS) infection. In the event of a suspected outbreak of AHS it is recommended that sera and heparinized blood should be tested for specific antibodies and AHSV antigen respectively. When available, post-mortem tissues, including spleen, heart, lung and liver, should also be tested for AHSV antigen. Although the ELISA used for the detection of AHSV antigen is highly sensitive and specific, negative ELISA results should be confirmed by virus isolation attempts.",1992

Three of the ponies died suddenly after showing mild clinical signs, the fourth pony remained clinically normal and was killed at day 38. Infectious AHSV was isolated from blood samples collected at intervals from all four ponies. Positive antigen ELISA reactions were only observed with blood samples from two of the ponies on the two days preceding death. Specific AHSV antibodies were detected by ELISA in serum samples from the other two ponies although one eventually died. African horse sickness viral antigens were detected by ELISA in post-mortem tissue samples collected from all four ponies. No infectious virus could be detected in tissue samples taken post-mortem from the pony which survived African horse sickness (AHS) infection. In the event of a suspected outbreak of AHS it is recommended that sera and heparinized blood should be tested for specific antibodies and AHSV antigen respectively. When available, post-mortem tissues, including spleen, heart, lung and liver, should also be tested for AHSV antigen. Although the ELISA used for the detection of AHSV antigen is highly sensitive and specific, negative ELISA results should be confirmed by virus isolation attempts.",1992

More than 1600 sera from 37 different countries were examined and results compared with those obtained by agar gel immuno-diffusion (AGID) tests. In no case did any of 775 sera from countries where AHS has never been reported and where AHS vaccines are not used, record an ELISA titre greater than 4. A titre equal to or greater than 8 was considered positive. Using this criterion, 96.3% of sera tested in both assays were in agreement.

Test sera consisted of 1300 bovine, 530 ovine and 160 carpine samples from bluetongue-free areas of Canada, 605 bovine and ovine field samples from the USA and Barbados and 464 samples from 79 cattle and sheep experimentally infected with 19 South African and five USA serotypes of bluetongue virus. The diagnostic specificity of the competitive ELISA, as determined for the bluetongue virus-free cattle sera was superior (99.92 per cent) to that of the indirect ELISA (99.85 per cent) and the AGID (99.0 per cent). The specificities of the competitive ELISA for sheep (99.63 per cent) and goats (100.0 per cent) sera were also higher than those of the AGID test. The performance of the ELISA tests was similar whether a gamma-ray-irradiated (2.0 Mrad) or a non-irradiated bluetongue virus antigen preparation was used. The competitive ELISA results for bovine field sera from endemic areas demonstrated a relatively low level of agreement (92.04 per cent) with AGID test results, with 9.7 per cent false negatives. The possible presence in these sera of antibody to cross-reacting antigens or to other orbiviruses, eg, epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus, which react in the AGID but not in the competitive ELISA may account for this lack of agreement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1989

Test sera consisted of 1300 bovine, 530 ovine and 160 carpine samples from bluetongue-free areas of Canada, 605 bovine and ovine field samples from the USA and Barbados and 464 samples from 79 cattle and sheep experimentally infected with 19 South African and five USA serotypes of bluetongue virus. The diagnostic specificity of the competitive ELISA, as determined for the bluetongue virus-free cattle sera was superior (99.92 per cent) to that of the indirect ELISA (99.85 per cent) and the AGID (99.0 per cent). The specificities of the competitive ELISA for sheep (99.63 per cent) and goats (100.0 per cent) sera were also higher than those of the AGID test. The performance of the ELISA tests was similar whether a gamma-ray-irradiated (2.0 Mrad) or a non-irradiated bluetongue virus antigen preparation was used. The competitive ELISA results for bovine field sera from endemic areas demonstrated a relatively low level of agreement (92.04 per cent) with AGID test results, with 9.7 per cent false negatives. The possible presence in these sera of antibody to cross-reacting antigens or to other orbiviruses, eg, epizootic haemorrhagic disease virus, which react in the AGID but not in the competitive ELISA may account for this lack of agreement.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1989

Rajgor","Detection of bluetongue virus antigen from livestock of Gujarat state","Bluetongue (BT) is an infectious, non-contagious disease of domestic and wild ruminants. Bluetongue virus (BTV) causes severe disease in sheep, which is transmitted by insect vector belonging to Culicoides spp. It is particularly a viral disease of sheep, occasionally affecting cattle, buffaloes, goats, camels and other wild ruminants. Out of 377 (364-blood, 5-spleen and 8-pooled Culicoides) samples 110 (29.18%) and 28 (7.42%) were found positive for BTV antigen by s-ELISA and BT-AGID respectively. Specieswise incidence by s-ELISA recorded was 48.20 per cent in sheep, 57.14 per cent in goats and 2.60 per cent in cattle however, none of the blood sample found positive from buffalo and camel. Specieswise incidence by BT-AGID recorded was 12.23 per cent in sheep and 15.71 per cent in goats however, none of the blood sample found positive for BTV antigen from cattle, buffalo and camel. Higher incidence seen in goats by both the test. s-ELISA proved to be the most sensitive in detecting BTV antigen than BT-AGID. Considering s-ELISA as the reference test, the relative sensitivity, specificity and overall agreement between both the tests were 25.45 per cent, 100 per cent and 78.24 per cent respectively.",2017

During the study period, a total of sixty PPR outbreaks were investigated. A total of 20 selected samples from these outbreaks were sequenced for N gene. The result analysis and the phylogenetic trees indicated two different viral groups in N gene: one was closer to China and Tajikistan, while other group was similar to isolates from Iran and Saudi Arabia. Efficacy of three commercially available tests for the antigen detection of PPR, that is, peste test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was compared. Keeping PCR as gold standard, sensitivity was calculated as 85% and 57% and specificity was calculated as 83% and 79% for ELISA and peste test, respectively. Value of K for ELISA was 0.67 which indicates good agreement between ELISA and RT-PCR. Value of K for peste test was 0.33 which indicates fair agreement between peste test and RT-PCR.

During the study period, a total of sixty PPR outbreaks were investigated. A total of 20 selected samples from these outbreaks were sequenced for N gene. The result analysis and the phylogenetic trees indicated two different viral groups in N gene: one was closer to China and Tajikistan, while other group was similar to isolates from Iran and Saudi Arabia. Efficacy of three commercially available tests for the antigen detection of PPR, that is, peste test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was compared. Keeping PCR as gold standard, sensitivity was calculated as 85% and 57% and specificity was calculated as 83% and 79% for ELISA and peste test, respectively. Value of K for ELISA was 0.67 which indicates good agreement between ELISA and RT-PCR. Value of K for peste test was 0.33 which indicates fair agreement between peste test and RT-PCR. In conclusion, study provides premier information about the use of different diagnostic tests and molecular situation of PPRV in Pakistan.  2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2020

Critical to the eradication of PPR are accurate diagnostic assays. RT-qPCR assays targeting the nucleocapsid gene of PPRV have been successfully used for the diagnosis of PPR. We describe the development of an RT-qPCR assay targeting an alternative region (the fusion (F) gene) based on the most up-to-date PPRV sequence data. In silico analysis of the F-gene RT-qPCR assay performed using PCRv software indicated 98% sensitivity and 100% specificity against all PPRV sequences published in Genbank. The assay indicated the greatest in silico sensitivity in comparison to other previously published and recommended PPRV RT-qPCR assays. We evaluated the assay using strains representative of all 4 lineages in addition to samples obtained from naturally and experimentally-infected animals. The F-gene RT-qPCR assay showed 100% diagnostic specificity and demonstrated a limit of detection of 10 PPRV genome copies per l. This RT-qPCR assay can be used in isolation or in conjunction with other assays for confirmation of PPR and should support the global efforts for eradication.  2019 The Authors",2019

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) provides cost-effective, rapid, specific and sensitive detection of nucleic acid and has been demonstrated to have field application for a range of viruses. We describe the development of a novel PPRV RT-LAMP assay utilising carefully-selected primers (targeting the N-gene) allowing for the detection of all known PPRV lineages in &lt; 20 min. The assay was evaluated in comparison with a gold standard real-time RT-PCR assay using more than 200 samples, comprising samples from recent PPRV outbreaks, experimentally-infected goats, well-characterised cell culture isolates and samples collected from uninfected animals. The RT-LAMP assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity and greater than 97% diagnostic sensitivity in comparison with the real-time RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection was between 0.3 and 0.8 log10 TCID50 ml-1 equating to a CT value of 31.52 to 33.48. In experimentally-infected animals, the RT-LAMP could detect PPRV as early as 4 days post infection (dpi) - before clinical signs were observed at 7 dpi.

The RT-LAMP assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity and greater than 97% diagnostic sensitivity in comparison with the real-time RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection was between 0.3 and 0.8 log10 TCID50 ml-1 equating to a CT value of 31.52 to 33.48.

The assay was evaluated in comparison with a gold standard real-time RT-PCR assay using more than 200 samples, comprising samples from recent PPRV outbreaks, experimentally-infected goats, well-characterised cell culture isolates and samples collected from uninfected animals. The RT-LAMP assay demonstrated 100% diagnostic specificity and greater than 97% diagnostic sensitivity in comparison with the real-time RT-PCR assay. The limit of detection was between 0.3 and 0.8 log10 TCID50 ml-1 equating to a CT value of 31.52 to 33.48. In experimentally-infected animals, the RT-LAMP could detect PPRV as early as 4 days post infection (dpi) - before clinical signs were observed at 7 dpi. The RT-LAMP assay can support the global PPR eradication campaign.  2019 The Authors",2019

The expressed rPPRVNP was in insoluble form and was purified under denaturation condition by Ni-NTA purification method followed by refolding, renaturation methods and further concentrated by protein cut-off concentrators for obtaining single protein band.

Materials and Methods: An outbreak resembled to PPR occurred in two different places of southern Gujarat viz. Vapi and Navsari, affecting 622 animals, including both goat (n = 476) and sheep (n = 146). Animals displayed the typical signs of PPR at Vapi however diarrhea was the inconsistent feature in animals of Navsari. The affection caused morbidity of 100% and mortality were 73.68% (n = 392/532) and 56.67% (n = 51/90) in Vapi and Navsari outbreaks, respectively. Relevant ante mortem and post mortem samples were collected from representative animals. At the outset of the epidemic no kit was available with us, so agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) was carried out and a commercial ELISA (cELISA) kit was ordered for making diagnosis through antibody demonstration. Meanwhile, an iELISA was developed in house using PPR vaccine as antigen and protein G conjugated HRPO antibody as detector. Histopathology and results of sandwich ELISA were also used to diagnose PPR virus (PPRV) in the outbreak. Results: The iELISA developed had detected PPRV antibodies in 22/24 samples (91.66%). Significant difference was observed in disease sensitivity pattern of two species by Chi-square test. While AGID failed to detect antibodies in any sample. Results were reconfirmed by comparing with commercially available cELISA kit. Conclusion: PPR is an economically important disease and for the rapid diagnosis of PPR the in house developed antibody capture iELISA can be a suitable cost effective alternative.

The specificity of the assay was assessed against viral nucleic acid extracted from a range of animal viruses of clinical and structural similarities to PPRV including canine distemper virus, measles virus, bluetongue virus and Newcastle disease virus. But none of the viruses and no template control showed an amplification signal. Sensitivity of the same assay was assessed based on plasmid DNA copy number and with respect to infectivity titre. The lower detection limit achieved was 2.88 plasmid DNA copies/l with corresponding Ct value of 35.93. Based on tissue culture infectivity titre the lower detection limits were 0.0001TCID50/ml and 1TCID50/ml for the SYBR green I based real time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR, respectively. The calculated coefficient of variations values for intra- and inter-assay variability were low, ranging from 0.21% to 1.83% and 0.44% to 1.97%, respectively. The performance of newly developed assay was evaluated on a total of 36 clinical samples suspected of PPR and compared with conventional RT-PCR. The SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR assay detected PPRV in 32 (88.8%) of clinical samples compared to 19 (52.7%) by conventional RT-PCR. Thus, the two-step SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR assay targeting the M gene of PPRV reported in this study was highly sensitive, specific and reproducible for detection and quantitation of PPRV nucleic acids.  2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014

The specificity of the assay was assessed against viral nucleic acid extracted from a range of animal viruses of clinical and structural similarities to PPRV including canine distemper virus, measles virus, bluetongue virus and Newcastle disease virus. But none of the viruses and no template control showed an amplification signal. Sensitivity of the same assay was assessed based on plasmid DNA copy number and with respect to infectivity titre. The lower detection limit achieved was 2.88 plasmid DNA copies/l with corresponding Ct value of 35.93. Based on tissue culture infectivity titre the lower detection limits were 0.0001TCID50/ml and 1TCID50/ml for the SYBR green I based real time RT-PCR and conventional RT-PCR, respectively.

The disease is characterized by severe pyrexia, oculo-nasal discharge, pneumonia, necrosis and ulceration of the mucous membrane and inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract leading to severe diarrhea. A SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR targeting the N gene of PPRV has not been established for PPRV detection. Thus, the objective of present study was to develop highly sensitive N gene target SYBR Green I real time RT-PCR for specific detection and quantification of PPRV in clinical samples. A set of primers was designed to detect the nucleocapsid (N) gene of PPRV.Results: The assay exhibited high specificity as all the viruses which have clinical and structural similarities to PPRV including Canine distemper virus (CDV), Measles virus (MV), Bluetongue virus (BTV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) failed to show an amplification signal. The lower detection limit of the assay was 5.11 copies/l (Ct value of 33.67  0.5) and 0.001 TCID50/ml (Ct value of 34.7  0.5) based on plasmid copy number and tissue culture infectivity titre. The assay was 3-log more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR. The coefficient of variation (CV) values for intra- and inter-assay variability were low, ranging from 0.32% - 2.31%, and 0.71% - 5.32%, respectively. To evaluate the performance of the newly developed assay, a total of 36 clinical samples suspected of PPR were screened for the presence of PPRV in parallel with conventional RT-PCR. The real time RT-PCR assay detected PPRV in 30 (83.3%) of clinical samples compared to 16 (44.4%) by conventional RT-PCR.Conclusions: The two-step SYBR Green I based real time RT-PCR assay reported here is highly sensitive, specific, reproducible and rapid for detection and quantification of PPRV nucleic acids.  2014 Abera et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014

Materials and Methods: The prevalence of PPR virus antibodies among domestic animals (goat, sheep, cattle and camel) populations in NE Nigeria was studied using virus neutralisation test (VNT) and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA). Results: An overall seroprevalence of 57% and 55% were revealed using VNT and c-ELISA, respectively. Significant difference (p<0.05) in the prevalence of PPR antibodies was noted between the different species of animals tested. Highest seroprevalence of 76.5% was found in sheep followed by a decreasing order of prevalence in goat 51.6%, camels 27.8% and cattle 16.7%. Similar pattern of prevalence was noted when the sera were tested for PPR using c-ELISA antibody. There was no significant difference in the sensitivity of both the procedures (VNT and c-ELISA) when used for the detection of PPR antibody in test sera. However, differences were noted in their specificity based on the degree of cross reactivity between PPR and rinderpest (RP) antibodies. Higher percentage of PPR positive sera (goats 64.8% and sheep 63.8%) cross-reacted with RP virus in VNT. None of the PPR positive sera from cattle and camels cross-reacted with RP virus in VNT and c-ELISA. Significant difference in gender and age was noted in the prevalence of PPR antibody among goats and sheep. Specificall, higher prevalence was found in females and the seroprevalence increased with age among the different age groups of goats studied. Analysis of the seasonal distribution of prevalence of PPR antibody in positive samples did not reveal any significant difference between seasons. Conclusion:We conclude that PPR virus is actively circulating among the ruminant and dromedary populations and that the infection may be endemic in the study area.

Materials and Methods: The prevalence of PPR virus antibodies among domestic animals (goat, sheep, cattle and camel) populations in NE Nigeria was studied using virus neutralisation test (VNT) and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA).

Methods: Epitope peptides of the nucleocapsid (N) protein of Tibetan PPRV were synthesized chemically and injected into rabbits to prepare hyperimmune antisera. Test sera were incubated simultaneously with hyperimmune antisera and added to the wells of ELISA plates coated previously with recombinant N protein. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was employed to detect the quantity of hyperimmune antisera combined with recombinant N protein. Results: A cELISA has been developed for monitoring PPRV infections with a cutoff value of 35. Relative sensitivity and specificity values of the epitope-based cELISA were 96.18 and 91.29%, respectively, when compared with a commercial cELISA kit in a test involving 1,039 serum samples. Conclusion: We report an efficient method for preparing antibody suitable for incorporation into a cELISA that can be used routinely for the detection of PPRV antibodies in serum samples. The method eliminated the requirement for virus culture and monoclonal antibody preparation, reduced the biorisk posed by virus-dependent manipulations, and the performance of the resultant cELISA compared favorably with a commercially available cELISA kit.

We developed a rapid competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (rapid c-ELISA) for the diagnosis and surveillance of PPR. This assay detects PPR virus (PPRV) antibodies in serum samples by quantifying the amount of monoclonal antibody (MAb) P-3H12 after 30 min of incubation of a serum-MAb conjugate mixture on plates coated with a PPRV recombinant nucleocapsid protein (rPPRV-N). We tested 249 PPRV-positive serum samples and 733 PPRV-negative serum samples from field ruminants. The threshold of percent inhibition (PI) was determined to be <50 on the basis of the mean PI plus 3 standard deviations for sera from PPRV-negative ruminants. The relative specificity and sensitivity of the rapid c-ELISA were 98.5% (722 of 733 serum samples) and 93.4% (234 of 249 serum samples), respectively. The rapid c-ELISA sensitively detected PPRV antibodies in hyperimmune sera (virus neutralization test [VNT] titer, >512), even at dilutions =512 in normal goat serum, and as early as 6 to 13 days post-infection from 12 goats, each of which was infected with one of the four PPRV lineages. Hyperimmune sera from animals experimentally vaccinated with rinderpest virus gave positive results by the rapid c-ELISA when the rinderpest virus VNT titers were >512, although the rapid c-ELISA titers were very low (2 to 16). However, the rapid c-ELISA was negative when the rinderpest virus VNT titer was =128. The rapid c-ELISA developed in the present work provides a short turnaround time and could be a useful tool for the diagnosis of PPR and screening for PPRV in the field.

The test is specific to PPR as it failed to detect rinderpest vaccine virus (RBOK strain). Varieties of clinical samples originating from laboratory experiments (n = 231) and from field (n = 259) were employed to test the efficacy of sandwich-ELISA test. The test compared very well with an internationally accepted commercial Immune-capture ELISA kit, which uses biotinylated monoclonal antibody against the nucleocapsid protein. On a parallel testing using 490 clinical samples, 4G6 MAb based sandwich ELISA had an overall relative diagnostic specificity of 92.8% and diagnostic sensitivity of 88.9% compared to the commercial kit.

To facilitate the control and eradication of CSF in China, the E2-based marker vaccine rAdV-SFV-E2, an adenovirus-delivered, alphavirus replicon-vectored vaccine, has been developed. Accordingly, an accompanying discriminatory test that allows differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) is required.

The optimized iELISA was able to detect CSFV-specific antibodies in the serum samples from the CSFV-infected pigs as early as 6 days post-infection, and discriminate the CSFV-infected pigs from those vaccinated with rAdV-SFV-E2. The iELISA was evaluated using a panel of swine sera, and showed comparable sensitivity (94.6%) and specificity (97.1%), and the consistence rates with the virus neutralization test were 96.8% for CSFV-infected swine sera, 83.3% for C-strain-vaccinated swine sera, and 95.0% for field swine sera.

A Pichia pastoris yeast-expressed CSFV glycoprotein E2 (yE2) has been shown to induce a protective immune response against the virus. To improve the expression level of yE2, the first codon of E2 gene, Arg (CGG), which is the least used in P. pastoris, was optimized to the most favorite codon AGA. The yield of E2 protein was remarkably increased in the codon optimized strain (N342). Three truncated E2 subunits encoding the N-terminal 330 (N330), 301 (N301), and 190 (N190) residues, respectively, were also constructed. The immunogenicity of each recombinant E2 subunits was confirmed by immunization of pigs, and all immunized groups demonstrated high neutralizing antibody titers after boost immunization, which lasted for a long period of time. In addition, a monoclonal antibody (MAb), 1B6, specific to yE2, was generated and shown to recognize CSFV-infected cells. A panel of swine sera were tested by peroxidase-conjugated MAb 1B6-based blocking enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using N330 as coated antigen, and the assay demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity.

In the present study, the DIVA vaccine properties of CP7_E2gif were evaluated in comparison to the conventional live attenuated Riemser C-strain vaccine. Sera and tonsil samples obtained from pigs immunised with these two vaccines were analysed. No viral RNA was found in serum after vaccination with CP7_E2gif, whereas some serum samples from C-strain vaccinated animals were positive. In both vaccinated groups, individual viral RNA-positive tonsil samples were detected in animals euthanised between 7 and 21 days post vaccination. Furthermore, serum samples from these animals, together with archival samples from pigs vaccinated with CP7_E2gif and subsequently CSFV challenged, were analysed for specific antibodies using ELISAs and for homologous neutralising antibodies. In animals vaccinated with CP7_E2gif, neutralising antibodies were detected from day 10. However, the sera remained negative for anti-CSFV E2-specific antibodies whereas pigs vaccinated with C-strain seroconverted against CSFV by 14 days after vaccination, as determined by a CSFV-E2 specific blocking ELISA. One week after subsequent CSFV challenge, a strong anti-CSFV E2 reaction was detected in CP7_E2gif vaccinated pigs and anti-Erns antibodies were detected from 10 days after infection. In conclusion, CP7_E2gif has the potential to be used as a DIVA vaccine in combination with detection of anti-CSFV E2-specific antibodies.  2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014

Of these, 223 were positive and 714 negative for neutralizing antibodies to classical swine fever virus (CSFV). In relation to the NPLA, the ELISA-I presented a 98.2% sensitivity; 92.86% specificity, 81.11% positive predictive value, 99.4% negative predictive value and a 94.1% precision. Statistical analysis showed a very strong correlation (r=0,94) between both tests. When compared to a commercially available ELISA kit, the performance of both, in relation to the NPLA, was similar.

For the comparison, nine hundred and thirty-seven swine serum samples were tested by serum neutralization followed by immunoperoxidase staining (NPLA), considered as the standard. Of these, 223 were positive and 714 negative for neutralizing antibodies to classical swine fever virus (CSFV). In relation to the NPLA, the ELISA-I presented a 98.2% sensitivity; 92.86% specificity, 81.11% positive predictive value, 99.4% negative predictive value and a 94.1% precision. Statistical analysis showed a very strong correlation (r=0,94) between both tests. When compared to a commercially available ELISA kit, the performance of both, in relation to the NPLA, was similar.

The 244 negative sera samples from SPF chicken were used to determine the cut-off value and define positive and negative sera samples. All sera were detected with the cELISA, and the cut-off value was set at the mean PI of 244 negative serum samples plus 3 standard deviations (SD) to ensure 99% confidence for the negative sera samples within this range.","Based on the nanobody-HRP fusion protein, the cELISA was firstly designed. First, the optimal amount of coating antigen and dilution of selected nanobody-HRP fusions for the cELISA were determined using a checkerboard titration with direct ELISA. Different amounts of the coating antigen included 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 ng/well, and the dilution ratios of nanobody-HRP fusions were 1:1, 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000, and 1:10,000. The final conditions were determined from the reaction that produced approximately 1.0 of OD450nm values in the direct ELISA.

The dilution of the tested chicken sera was also optimized. Four separate positive and negative chicken sera for anti-NDV IgG antibodies were diluted with 1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:640, and 1:1280 for cELISA testing. The optimal amount of coated antigen and dilution of nanobody-HRP fusions were used. Then, the optimal serum dilution was determined when the smallest ratio of OD450nm values between the positive and negative serum (P/N) were obtained.

The competition times of between testing sera antibody and nanobody-HRP fusions with antigen and colorimetric reaction were also optimised. The incubation times of the mixtures containing the nanobody-HRP fusions and the positive or negative sera with coated antigen were tested for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45, and 60 min. After TMB was added into the plates, 10 and 15 min were selected as the colorimetric reaction times. Using a checkerboard titration, the two optimal times were determined as those when the smallest ratio of P/N was obtained.

After optimising the above conditions, the 96-well ELISA plates were coated with the optimal amount of NDV-NP recombinant protein in the PBS (pH 7.2) buffer and incubated overnight at 4 C or for 1 h at RT. Then, the plates were blocked with blocking buffer at RT for 1 h. After washed with PBST, the wells were added into 100 L of testing mixtures containing the optimal dilutions of serum sample and nanobody-HRP fusions in the blocking buffer then incubated for optimal times at RT. After washed three times again, 100 L TMB was added into each well, which were then incubated for optimal times at RT. As a final step, 3 M H2SO4 (50 L/well) was used to stop the colorimetric reaction, and the OD450nm values were read by an automated ELISA plate reader.","Cut-off = 18%",NA,723,355,368,360,363,"100","98.6",NA,NA,NA,NA,"not investigated/not given/not relevant",567,"520431","Serum","comparison","Sheng, et al. 2019.","Sheng, Y., Wang, K., Lu, Q., Ji, P., Liu, B., Zhu, J., Liu, Q., Sun, Y., Zhang, J., Zhou, E.-M., Zhao, Q.","Nanobody-horseradish peroxidase fusion protein as an ultrasensitive probe to detect antibodies against Newcastle disease virus in the immunoassay","Background: Sensitive and specific antibodies can be used as essential probes to develop competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA).

Nanobodies, which are single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), offer an alternative, more promising tool to circumvent these limitations. In the present work, a cELISA using nanobody-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) fusion protein firstly designed as a probe was developed for detecting anti-Newcastle disease virus (NDV) antibodies in chicken sera. Results: In the study, a platform for the rapid and simple production of nanobody-HRP fusion protein was constructed. First, a total of 9 anti-NDV-NP protein nanobodies were screened from a immunised Bactrian camel. Then, the Nb5-HRP fusions were produced with the platform and used for the first time as sensitive reagents for developing cELISA to detect anti-NDV antibodies. The cut-off value of the cELISA was 18%, and the sensitivity and specificity were respectively 100% and 98.6%. The HI test and commercial ELISA kit (IDEXX) separately agreed 97.83% and 98.1% with cELISA when testing clinical chicken sera and both agreed 100% when testing egg yolks.

Control of ND primarily relies on prophylactic vaccination of flocks, and many vaccines are available on the market, both conventional and more recently introduced new generation recombinant types. To assess the protection level achieved by vaccination ELISA tests are typically used, they also are to track an infection with field strains in non-vaccinated flocks. Special modifications of ELISA can be used as a screening tool to detect infection in flocks vaccinated with new generation vaccines. In this study, we have developed an ELISA test for the detection of antibodies against the nucleoprotein (NP) of NDV and for differentiation of chickens vaccinated with commercial and prototype in-house recombinant vector vaccines from those infected with field NDV strains. The NP gene of LaSota NDV strain expressed in a baculovirus vector was used as a coating antigen in the ELISA. The developed test was optimized, validated and compared to other serological tests. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of recombinant NP protein-based ELISA were respectively 96.1%, 96.3%, and 96.2%. Inter-rater (kappa) agreement between the NP-ELISA and the gold standard HI test was calculated to be 0.995. In our comparisons, commercially available ELISA tests revealed different specificities ranging from 95.5100% and sensitivities at variance, ranging from 90.1 to 99.0%. A high level of maternally derived antibodies was measured in the serum of 1-day-old broilers in the NP-ELISA assay. These antibodies had disappeared and were undetected at 3, 5 and 6 weeks post-vaccination but birds became positive again at 2 weeks after control infection with a velogenic NDV strain. In SPF chickens, antibodies against NP protein were detected only after a challenge. The recombinant NP protein-based ELISA test is sensitive, specific and accurate when compared to the gold standard HI test and commercially available kits. Moreover, the method could be also used for the differentiation between vaccinated and infected birds.  2019 Polish Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.",2019

Control of ND primarily relies on prophylactic vaccination of flocks, and many vaccines are available on the market, both conventional and more recently introduced new generation recombinant types. To assess the protection level achieved by vaccination ELISA tests are typically used, they also are to track an infection with field strains in non-vaccinated flocks.

Methods: Full length and C-terminally truncated nucleocapsid (NP) protein, and the unique C-terminal regions of the phospho- (P) and V proteins of the NDV LaSota strain were bacterially expressed as fusion proteins with the multimerization domain of the human C4 binding protein, and used as diagnostic antigens in indirect ELISA. Results: When used as diagnostic antigen in indirect ELISAs, recombinant full-length proved to be a sensitive target to detect seroconversion in chickens after APMV-1 vaccination and infection, but revealed some degree of cross reactivity with sera raised against other APMV subtypes. Cross reactivity was abolished but also sensitivity decreased when employing a C-terminal fragment of the NP of NDV as diagnostic antigen.

Methods: Full length and C-terminally truncated nucleocapsid (NP) protein, and the unique C-terminal regions of the phospho- (P) and V proteins of the NDV LaSota strain were bacterially expressed as fusion proteins with the multimerization domain of the human C4 binding protein, and used as diagnostic antigens in indirect ELISA. Results: When used as diagnostic antigen in indirect ELISAs, recombinant full-length proved to be a sensitive target to detect seroconversion in chickens after APMV-1 vaccination and infection, but revealed some degree of cross reactivity with sera raised against other APMV subtypes. Cross reactivity was abolished but also sensitivity decreased when employing a C-terminal fragment of the NP of NDV as diagnostic antigen. Antibodies to the NDV V protein were mounted in poultry following NDV infection but also, albeit at lower rates and titers, after vaccination with attenuated NDV vaccines. V-specific seroconversion within the flock was incomplete and titers in individual bird transient. Conclusions: Indirect ELISA based on bacterially expressed recombinant full-length NP compared favorably with a commercial NDV ELISA based on whole virus antigen, but cross reactivity between the NP proteins of different APMV subtypes could compromise specificity. However, specificity increased when using a less conserved C-terminal fragment of NP instead. Moreover, a serological DIVA strategy built on the NDV V protein was not feasible due to reduced immunogenicity of the V protein and frequent use of live-attenuated NDV vaccines.  2018 The Author(s).",2018

APMV-1 antibody detection is used for surveillance and to control vaccination, but is hampered by cross-reactivity to other subtypes of avian Avulaviruses. Data are lacking concerning the applicability of NDV V proteins as differential diagnostic marker to distinguish vaccinated from virus-infected birds (DIVA strategy). Methods: Full length and C-terminally truncated nucleocapsid (NP) protein, and the unique C-terminal regions of the phospho- (P) and V proteins of the NDV LaSota strain were bacterially expressed as fusion proteins with the multimerization domain of the human C4 binding protein, and used as diagnostic antigens in indirect ELISA. Results: When used as diagnostic antigen in indirect ELISAs, recombinant full-length proved to be a sensitive target to detect seroconversion in chickens after APMV-1 vaccination and infection, but revealed some degree of cross reactivity with sera raised against other APMV subtypes. Cross reactivity was abolished but also sensitivity decreased when employing a C-terminal fragment of the NP of NDV as diagnostic antigen.

APMV-1 antibody detection is used for surveillance and to control vaccination, but is hampered by cross-reactivity to other subtypes of avian Avulaviruses. Data are lacking concerning the applicability of NDV V proteins as differential diagnostic marker to distinguish vaccinated from virus-infected birds (DIVA strategy). Methods: Full length and C-terminally truncated nucleocapsid (NP) protein, and the unique C-terminal regions of the phospho- (P) and V proteins of the NDV LaSota strain were bacterially expressed as fusion proteins with the multimerization domain of the human C4 binding protein, and used as diagnostic antigens in indirect ELISA. Results: When used as diagnostic antigen in indirect ELISAs, recombinant full-length proved to be a sensitive target to detect seroconversion in chickens after APMV-1 vaccination and infection, but revealed some degree of cross reactivity with sera raised against other APMV subtypes. Cross reactivity was abolished but also sensitivity decreased when employing a C-terminal fragment of the NP of NDV as diagnostic antigen.

Conclusions: Indirect ELISA based on bacterially expressed recombinant full-length NP compared favorably with a commercial NDV ELISA based on whole virus antigen, but cross reactivity between the NP proteins of different APMV subtypes could compromise specificity.

The specificity and sensitivity of the CELISA was found to be 98.4 and 98.9%, respectively, for chickens, and 98.2 and 97.9% for ducks. However, the C-ELISA showed weak cross-reaction with hyperimmune antisera to some other avian paramyxovirus serotypes. In all experimentally vaccinated chickens, seroconversion rates at 7 d postinoculation were 100 and 40% when measured by C-ELISA and hemagglutination inhibition (HI), respectively. In field trials, the C-ELISA showed positive results in 98.9% of HI-positive sera and 40.8% of HI-negative sera from NDVvaccinated chickens (n = 705). In domestic ducks (n = 158) from NDV-positive duck farms (n = 8), the positive rates according to C-ELISA were significantly higher than those according to the HI test. At the same time, 98.1% of ducks (n = 209) from NDV-negative duck farms (n = 11) were also negative by C-ELISA.

The ability of the recombinant N antigen to detect RVFV antibody responses was evaluated in ELISA format using antisera from sheep and cattle experimentally infected with two genetically distinct wild-type RVFV strains and sera from indigenous sheep and goat populations exposed to natural RVFV field infection in The Gambia. The recombinant N exhibited specific reactivity with the N-specific monoclonal antibody and various hyperimmune serum samples from ruminants. The indirect ELISA detected N-specific antibody responses in animals with 100% sensitivity compared to the plaque reduction neutralization test (6 to 21 days postinfection) and with 97% and 100% specificity in sheep and cattle, respectively.

No serological cross-reactions were observed with the related mycoplasmas of the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster. The N-terminal domain of the mature lipoprotein LppQ is hydrophilic, and it induces a strong, specific, early, and persistent immune response in naturally and experimentally infected animals. Mycoplasma-specific TGA (Trp) codons are utilized as stop codons in most other organisms. The lppQ N-terminal fragment from MmmSC HVRI X strain, the Chinese strain for CF antigen production, was mutated with one-step overlapping extension PCR. Sequence analysis confirmed the successful mutation from A to G in codon 198 in the lppQ gene. The fragment containing the mutation site was subcloned into the pET32a expression vector. The recombinant protein with molecular weight of 42 kDa was purified using the Ni-NTA His-Bind purification kit, with a purity of up to 95%. Western blot indicated that the standard positive serum of CBPP could react with the recombinant protein. The purified protein was diluted to 0.35 g mL-1, and coated to microtiter enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates. Indirect ELISA reaction conditions were optimized. The value of P/N was determined to be 4.8 (0.934/0.193), the sensitivity to be 95.8% (46/48), and the specificity to be 98.9% (161/163). 3817 cattle serum samples from three different provinces were detected by the indirect ELISA and CFT. The Kappa value is 0.63, which is middle or high agreement between the two methods.  2007 Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.",2007

To address this issue and provide a variety of choices, a sensitive and specific blocking-ELISA (b-ELISA) test to detect antibodies against CCPP was developed. We describe the newly developed CCPP blocking-ELISA based on the blocking of an epitope of a monoclonal antibody (Mccp-25) by a positive serum sample against the Mccp protein coated on a plate. The Percentage Inhibition (PI) cut-off value for the CCPP b-ELISA was set at 50 using 466 CCPP negative and 84 CCPP positive small ruminant sera. Of the negative sera, 307 were obtained from the Botswana National Veterinary Laboratory (BNVL) and 159 from the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute (FLI) Germany.

Here, we exploited this system to construct and evaluate a diagnostic tool for glanders. Burkholderia mallei, the causative agent of glanders, is a highly infectious and fatal zoonotic pathogen that infects horses, mules, donkeys, and occasionally humans. A highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tool is crucial for the control, elimination, and eradication of B. mallei infections. We constructed plasmids carrying synthetic genes encoding a modified, previously unannotated Burkholderia glycoprotein containing three glycosylation sequons fused to the cholera toxin B-subunit. The resulting proteins were glycosylated in the B. cenocepacia K56-2 parental strain, but not in glycosylation-deficient mutants, as determined by SDS-PAGE and fluorescent lectin blots. One of these glycoproteins was used as an antigen in ELISA and western blots to screen a panel of serum samples collected from glanders-infected and healthy horses, which were previously investigated by complement fixation test and indirect ELISA based on a semi-purified fraction of B. mallei. We show that ELISA and western blot assays based on our glycoprotein antigen provide 100% specificity, with a sensitivity greater than 88%. The glycoprotein antigen was recognized by serum samples collected from patients infected with B. pseudomallei, B. mallei, B. multivorans, and B. cenocepacia.

The present study aimed to develop an immunoblotting assay based on whole-cell proteome of B. mallei to enable accurate serodiagnosis of glanders. Materials and Methods: Three farm horses were subcutaneously immunized with a crude suspension (106 cfu/ml) of heat-inactivated B. mallei formulated with incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) to achieve a hyperimmune sera panel. The immunization was done for 1, 14 and 28 days with 1 dose of 1 ml antigen containing 106 cfu/ml. The hyperimmunity of sera was confirmed by CFT. B. mallei whole-cell proteome was prepared through sonication and the protein content was visualized by SDS-PAGE and quantified by Western blot using HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-horse IgG. A comprehensive set of positive and negative horse sera validated the test. Results: A ladder pattern of the B. mallei immunoreactive antigens was seen within the region of 20-90 kDa clearly and the immunoblot was scored positive, while no reaction was seen for the negative sera. The Western blot assay indicated a noticeably higher diagnostic specificity for positive or negative sera of glanders. Conclusion: The whole-cell proteome-based immunoblot proved reliable and straightforward in our study. The prepared antigen was adaptable for application in immunoblotting.

It is caused by Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides, a bacterium belonging to the Mycoplasma mycoides cluster. In the absence of an efficient CBPP vaccine, improved and easy-to-use diagnostic assays for recurrent testing combined with isolation and treatment of positive animals represent an option for CBPP control in Africa. Here we describe the comprehensive screening of 17 immunogenic Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides proteins using well-characterized bovine sera for the development of a novel cocktail enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for laboratory use. Two recombinant Mycoplasma immunogens, MSC-0136 and MSC-0636, were used to set up a standardized cocktail ELISA protocol. According to the results from more than 100 serum samples tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the novel cocktail ELISA were 85.6% and 96.4%, respectively, with an overall diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of the Office International des Epizooties (OIE)-prescribed serological assays. In addition, we provide a proof of principle for a field-applicable, easy-to-use commercially produced prototype lateral-flow test for rapid (<30-min) diagnosis of CBPP.  2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Although a good advance has been made to understand the virus, a safe and effective vaccine against ASFV is still lacking and its eradication solely depends on its early and accurate diagnosis. Thus, improving the available diagnostic assays and adding some validated techniques are useful for a range of serological investigations. The aim of this study was to produce and characterize p54 monoclonal antibodies with an ultimate goal of developing a mono-clonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for ASFV antibody detection. Five monoclonal antibodies against p54 protein expressed in Escherichia coli was generated and their characterizations were investigated. Furthermore, a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) based on a monoclonal antibody designated as 2A7 was developed. To evaluate the performance of the assay, a total of 365 pig serum samples (178 negative and 187 positive samples) were tested and a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to determine the cut-off value. Based on the ROC analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.982 (95% confidence interval: 96.9% to 99.4%), besides a sensitivity of 92.5% and a specificity of 98.9% was achieved when the percent inhibition of 20% was selected as a threshold. Moreover, the result showed an excellent agreement when compared to other commercially available blocking ELISA (kappa value = 0.912) and showed no reaction to other swine pathogens. Overall, the newly developed cELISA method offers a promising approach for a rapid and convenient ASFV serodiagnosis, which could be used as alternative to other serological assays for screening possible ASFV infection.  2021 by the authors.

Although it can cause significant economic losses, available serological assays are still not sufficiently efficient and reliable. A 3-day VNT was performed using Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell line and LSDV isolated from clinically infected cow to improve serological diagnostics of lumpy skin disease (LSD). In total, 325 cattle sera samples were tested in order to compare the performances of VNT and ELISA. Tested samples originated from 125 cows before the occurrence of LSD in the Republic of Serbia and 200 tested samples originated from vaccinated cows. Sera samples from vaccinated cows were collected starting from the vaccination day to 4 months after vaccination. In 7 different time intervals after vaccination sampling was carried out in 20 cows originating from one herd and in 3 different time intervals in 20 cows originating from a different herd each time of sampling. Out of 200 samples from vaccinated cows, antibodies against LSDV were detected in 68 (34%) samples by VNT, and in 60 (30%) samples by ELISA. No positive finding was detected by VNT in samples collected before the occurrence of LSD in Serbia, while one positive finding was detected in the same samples by ELISA. The first presence of antibodies in vaccinated cattle was detected by both tests 20 days after vaccination, and the largest number of animals with antibodies against LSDV was detected 30 days after vaccination.

In total, 325 cattle sera samples were tested in order to compare the performances of VNT and ELISA. Tested samples originated from 125 cows before the occurrence of LSD in the Republic of Serbia and 200 tested samples originated from vaccinated cows. Sera samples from vaccinated cows were collected starting from the vaccination day to 4 months after vaccination.

Out of 200 samples from vaccinated cows, antibodies against LSDV were detected in 68 (34%) samples by VNT, and in 60 (30%) samples by ELISA. No positive finding was detected by VNT in samples collected before the occurrence of LSD in Serbia, while one positive finding was detected in the same samples by ELISA.

Cattle and buffalo were examined owing to the appearance of skin lesions. Because clinical signs were consistent with LSDV infection, samples from cattle in a non-grazing dairy farm (n = 450) were submitted for LSDV testing together with those from the in-contact buffaloes (n = 100). Results revealed that the intra-herd percentage of cattle infected with LSDV varied with the detection method. This ranged from 22.4% to 65.4% by virus isolation (VI) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively, in clinical cattle samples, compared to 0% and 10% by VI and PCR in non-clinical cases. Using the neutralising index (NI), LSDV antibodies were found in 100% (n = 100) of the tested cows sera (NI = > 2.0 and = 3.0), whereas buffalos sera (n = 34) displayed little increase in antibody level (NI = 1.5).

Virus neutralization indexes were determined for the experimental sera in OA3.Ts cells. The specificity of the ELISA was determined using 231 sera from capripoxvirus nave sheep and goats from Canada. In addition, the ELISA was tested for cross-reactivity to anti-orf virus antibodies using orf-reactive sera and no cross-reactivity was observed. Using experimentally generated sera obtained from animals infected with virulent sheeppox or goatpox virus isolates, the diagnostic sensitivity of the ELISA was 96% with a diagnostic specificity of 95%, where the diagnostic sensitivity of the virus neutralization assay was 96% with a diagnostic specificity of 100%. Further evaluation of this ELISA, using 276 cattle serum samples that were positive by virus neutralization assays, revealed a diagnostic sensitivity of 88% with a specificity of 97%.

The multiplex ELISA was designed using selected, type-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) coated onto ELISA plates as catching antibodies and a unique pan-FMDV MAb (1F10) as detector conjugate. Capture MAbs with the broadest intratypic reactivity were selected for each of the four FMDV serotypes by screening large panels of candidate MAbs with a wide spectrum of representative FMDV isolates. An additional pan-FMDV ELISA using 1F10 MAb for both capture and detection was used to complement the specific typing ELISAs to detect virus isolates, which might escape binding to the selected serotype-specific MAbs. This multiplex ELISA was prepared in a stabilized format, with immunoplates pre-coated with six MAbs and positive antigen controls already trapped by the relevant MAb, with the view to make available a diagnostic kit. Diagnostic performance of the MAbsmultiplex ELISA was analysed using 299 FMDV-positive epithelial suspensions representative of the antigenic and genomic variability within each serotype. Overall, the results provided evidence that the diagnostic performance of this assay platform is improved compared to the more complex polyclonal-based antigen detection ELISA; combining data from different serotypes and referring to the gold standard tests (i.e. virus isolation and/or RT-PCR), the MAbsmultiplex ELISA showed a sensitivity of 79% for the serotype-specific ELISA, compared to 72% for the polyclonal ELISA. The absence of reactivity of a minority of FMDV strains using the MAbsmultiplex ELISA can largely be attributed to deteriorated or low antigen concentration in the sample. This multiplex ELISA is simple, rapid and stable. FMDV antigenic diversity was adequately covered by the selected MAbs. Therefore, it can be used to replace existing polyclonal ELISAs for FMDV detection and serotyping.  2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH",2020

The use of VLPs in the SPCE assay as a replacement for inactivated FMDV provides a high level of biosafety. The SPCE showed high concordance rates when compared with the virus neutralization test and liquid-phase blocking ELISA for testing clinical serum samples and successive serological monitoring (kappa = 0.925). Thus, this SPCE is an alternative method for post-immunization detection of antibodies against FMDV serotype A, with high specificity and sensitivity.  2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",2020

Numerous categories of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been developed and widely used to evaluate herd immunity. Manufacturing inactivated FMD virus (FMDV) as a diagnostic antigen requires a facility with a high level of biosafety, but this requirement raises concern on viral leakage. In our previous study, bacterium-original FMD virus-like particles (VLPs) resemble the authentic FMDV and induce protective immunity against homologous viral challenges, thereby demonstrating that they are sufficiently safe without limitations on biosafety facilities and easily prepared. Herein, we developed a competitive ELISA (cELISA) based on FMDV-VLPs as a diagnostic antigen to evaluate herd immunity. The criterion of this cELISA was determined by detecting panels of positive sera with different antibody titers and negative sera. The working parameter of cELISA was optimized, and samples with a percentage inhibition of = 50% were considered positive. The specificity of cELISA to test 277 serum samples with various antibody titers was 100%, and the sensitivity reached 96%. The coincidence rates of cELISA with a VDPro FMDV and a PrioCHECK FMDV type O antibody ELISA kit were 97.8% and 98.2%, respectively. Repeatability tests demonstrated that the coefficients of variation within and between runs were less than 7% and 14%, respectively. Our data demonstrated that cELISA based on bacterium-original VLPs had high specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility. The cELISA could also be used for evaluating vaccination herd immunity effects, especially in developing countries.  2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",2019

In FMD-free countries with vaccination, such as Korea, vaccination programs should guarantee prevention against transmission of FMD. Monitoring of vaccination programs is also essential for ensuring sufficient coverage that will limit the transmission of FMDV. There are several methods to screen FMD virus (FMDV) structural protein (SP) antibodies including SPCE (Solid-phase competitive ELISA), LPBE (Liquid-phase blocking ELISA), and VNT (Virus neutralization test). Among these, SPCE is widely used for serological monitoring since VNT - the gold standard method - has certain practical limitations, such as high costs in terms of time and labor. However, whether SPCE can ensure the vaccination status of individual animals and whole farms is unclear. In this study, SPCE, LPBE and VNT were compared with respect to correlation with each other and sensitivity at commercial pig farms. Results: The positive results obtained by PrioCHECK SPCE differed from those obtained by LPBE and VNT. The sensitivity of SPCE relative to those of the other tests was fairly low. The raw data of SPCE were most highly correlated with those of VNT with XJ strain, while their positivity and negativity were most highly correlated with LPBE. The results of ROC analysis proposed new cut-off for PrioCHECK SPCE higher than the previous 50% inhibition. Conclusions: The high false positive rate of PrioCHECK SPCE suggested that high seropositivity by SPCE may not guarantee a true vaccination coverage. Adjusting the cut-off percentage (%) inhibition value for SPCE is needed to address this problem, and it is highly recommended that routine FMDV serological monitoring programs using PrioCHECK SPCE should be combined with alternative methods such as LPBE or VNT.  2018 The Author(s).",2018

Nevertheless, due to the observed variability in the antibody response to NSPs, the likelihood of screening or confirming the FMD infection status in animals is increased if an antibody profile to multiple NSPs is considered for diagnosis. In order to develop and evaluate an additional NSP-based diagnostic assay, in this study, the recombinant 3A protein of FMDV was expressed in Escherichia coli and used as an antigen for detection of FMD infection specific antibodies. At the fixed cut-off value of 45 percentage of positivity, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 3A indirect-ELISA (I-ELISA) were found to be 95.7% and 96.3%, respectively. In FMD naturally infected cattle, about 85% of clinically infected and 75% of asymptomatic in-contact populations were found positive at 13 months post-outbreak. The 3A I-ELISA was further evaluated with the bovine serum samples collected randomly from different parts of the country. Furthermore, the performance of newly developed 3A I-ELISA was compared with the extensively used in-house r3AB3 I-ELISA, and the overall concordance in test results was found to be 93.62%.

Nevertheless, due to the observed variability in the antibody response to NSPs, the likelihood of screening or confirming the FMD infection status in animals is increased if an antibody profile to multiple NSPs is considered for diagnosis. In order to develop and evaluate an additional NSP-based diagnostic assay, in this study, the recombinant 3A protein of FMDV was expressed in Escherichia coli and used as an antigen for detection of FMD infection specific antibodies. At the fixed cut-off value of 45 percentage of positivity, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 3A indirect-ELISA (I-ELISA) were found to be 95.7% and 96.3%, respectively. In FMD naturally infected cattle, about 85% of clinically infected and 75% of asymptomatic in-contact populations were found positive at 13 months post-outbreak. The 3A I-ELISA was further evaluated with the bovine serum samples collected randomly from different parts of the country. Furthermore, the performance of newly developed 3A I-ELISA was compared with the extensively used in-house r3AB3 I-ELISA, and the overall concordance in test results was found to be 93.62%. The r3A I-ELISA could be useful as a screening or confirmatory assay in the sero-surveillance of FMD in India irrespective of extensive bi-annual vaccination.  2016 International Alliance for Biological Standardization.",2016

Performance of serological tests used for FMD is faced with challenges like low test sensitivity, low tests agreement levels, in concise test cut-offs, cost of the tests and numerous FMD serotypes which may lead to misdiagnosis. Objective: To determine the sensitivity of assays Anigen  FMD NSP Ab ELISA Korea, NSP Priocheck kits with Liquid Phase Blocking Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay compared with Virus neutralisation test ( the gold standard). Design: A cross-sectional study design. Setting: Kilifi County. Subjects: Four hundred and twenty one cattle. Results: The results showed that both Anigen  FMD NSP Ab ELISA (Korea), NSP Priocheck Netherlands assays had low sensitivity but high specificity. Liquid Phase Blocking ELI SA had the highest sensitivity 100%. LPBE had a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) =100%, Anigen  FMD NSP Ab ELISAKorea 94.44% and NSP Priocheck Netherlands had the lowest 44.74% compared with the VNT 100%.

Vaccination against FMD is a key element in the control of FMD. However, vaccination of susceptible animals raises critical issues, such as the differentiation of infected animals from vaccinated animals. The current study developed a reliable and rapid test to detect antibodies against the conserved, nonstructural proteins (NSPs) of the FMD virus (FMDV) to distinguish infected animals from vaccinated animals. A monoclonal antibody (MAb) against the FMDV NSP 3B was produced. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA) for FMDV/NSP antibody detection was developed using a recombinant 3ABC protein as the antigen and the 3B-specific MAb. Sera collected from naive, FMDV experimentally infected, vaccinated carrier, and noncarrier animals were tested using the 3B cELISA. The diagnostic specificity was 99.4% for naive animals (cattle, pigs, and sheep) and 99.7% for vaccinated noncarrier animals. The diagnostic sensitivity was 100% for experimentally inoculated animals and 64% for vaccinated carrier animals. The performance of this 3B cELISA was compared to that of four commercial ELISA kits using a panel of serum samples established by the World Reference Laboratory for FMD at The Pirbright Institute, Pirbright, United Kingdom. The diagnostic sensitivity of the 3B cELISA for the panel of FMDV/NSP-positive bovine serum samples was 94%, which was comparable to or better than that of the commercially available NSP antibody detection kits. This 3B cELISA is a simple, reliable test to detect antibodies against FMDV nonstructural proteins. Copyright  2015, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.",2015

Conclusions: The 3ABC ELISA identified field and experimentally infected animals, as well as vaccinated and subsequently infected animals. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity estimates for other FMD NSP tests are comparable with the results obtained in this study.

Design: Test development and validation study. Methods: The diagnostic specificity was determined using 2535 sera from nave animals and 1112 sera from vaccinated animals. Diagnostic sensitivity was calculated from the data for 995 sera from experimentally and field-infected animals from FMD-endemic countries in South East Asia. A commercial ELISA detecting antibodies against FMD virus NSP was used as the reference test to establish relative sensitivity and specificity. Bayesian latent class analysis was performed to corroborate results. The diagnostic window and rate of detection were determined at different times using sera from cattle, sheep and pigs before and after infection, and after vaccination and subsequent infection. Repeatability and reproducibility data were established. Results: At 35% test cut-off, the 3ABC ELISA had an overall diagnostic sensitivity of 91.5% and diagnostic specificity of 96.4%.

Animals in the endemic settings are regularly vaccinated in addition to intensive surveillance for control of the disease. Under intensive vaccination, detection of infected animals among the vaccinated population is essential to monitor the infection and to track down the virus movement. Sero-surveillance and retrospective disease diagnosis is performed primarily by detecting antibodies against non-structural proteins (NSPs) of FMD virus which are usually absent in the inactivated vaccine formulations. The study was conducted with an objective to compare simultaneously performance of six NSP ELISAs in detecting infected animals in the areas covered under intensive vaccination, and to assess their fit-for-purpose attribute for sero-surveillance of FMD in India. A panel of bovine serum samples consisting of samples collected from infected with FMDV, vaccinated and naive animals were constituted. In addition, samples collected at random from areas having varied FMD situation and vaccination coverage were tested simultaneously by the six NSP ELISAs to compare their performances. The four indigenous assays showed varying degrees of correlation with the two commercial kits. The study validated that, in all the groups of samples, the indigenous assays were equally sensitive and specific as the two commercial kits. Among all the six assays, PrioCheck and in-house 3ABC I-ELISAs showed maximum sensitivity for detection of infected animals, whereas 3AB3 I-ELISA and 3ABC C-ELISA showed maximum specificity.

The study was conducted with an objective to compare simultaneously performance of six NSP ELISAs in detecting infected animals in the areas covered under intensive vaccination, and to assess their fit-for-purpose attribute for sero-surveillance of FMD in India. A panel of bovine serum samples consisting of samples collected from infected with FMDV, vaccinated and naive animals were constituted. In addition, samples collected at random from areas having varied FMD situation and vaccination coverage were tested simultaneously by the six NSP ELISAs to compare their performances. The four indigenous assays showed varying degrees of correlation with the two commercial kits. The study validated that, in all the groups of samples, the indigenous assays were equally sensitive and specific as the two commercial kits. Among all the six assays, PrioCheck and in-house 3ABC I-ELISAs showed maximum sensitivity for detection of infected animals, whereas 3AB3 I-ELISA and 3ABC C-ELISA showed maximum specificity. The study concluded that the in-house available assays are equally capable as the commercially available kits for differentiation of infected animals under intensive vaccination and identifies the 3AB3 I-ELISA with optimum sensitivity and specificity for the purpose of sero-surveillance in India.  2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014

The study was conducted with an objective to compare simultaneously performance of six NSP ELISAs in detecting infected animals in the areas covered under intensive vaccination, and to assess their fit-for-purpose attribute for sero-surveillance of FMD in India. A panel of bovine serum samples consisting of samples collected from infected with FMDV, vaccinated and naive animals were constituted. In addition, samples collected at random from areas having varied FMD situation and vaccination coverage were tested simultaneously by the six NSP ELISAs to compare their performances. The four indigenous assays showed varying degrees of correlation with the two commercial kits. The study validated that, in all the groups of samples, the indigenous assays were equally sensitive and specific as the two commercial kits. Among all the six assays, PrioCheck and in-house 3ABC I-ELISAs showed maximum sensitivity for detection of infected animals, whereas 3AB3 I-ELISA and 3ABC C-ELISA showed maximum specificity. The study concluded that the in-house available assays are equally capable as the commercially available kits for differentiation of infected animals under intensive vaccination and identifies the 3AB3 I-ELISA with optimum sensitivity and specificity for the purpose of sero-surveillance in India.  2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014

The study used cell culture grown antigens (1351 FMDV positive) derived from suspected cases of vesicular disease collected from 86 countries between 1924 and 2011, those positive for the other vesicular diseases of swine vesicular disease (n= 25) and vesicular stomatitis (n= 45) and negative samples collected from uninfected cell cultures (n= 36). The diagnostic sensitivity of the assays was similar at 98.1% (polyclonal ELISA) compared to 97.9% (integrin/Mab ELISA) but the serotypic-specificity of the latter was vastly superior (96%) to that of the former (61.5%). Reactions with the viruses of swine vesicular disease and vesicular stomatitis, which produce clinically indistinguishable syndromes in pigs and cattle, did not occur.

Two of the 17 primer-probe sets included in this multiplex assay were adopted from previously characterized real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays for FMDV. The diagnostic accuracy of the mRT-PCR assay was evaluated using 287 field samples, including 247 samples (213 true-positive samples and 35 true-negative samples) from suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease collected from 65 countries between 1965 and 2006 and 39 true-negative samples collected from healthy animals. The mRT-PCR assay results were compared to those of two singleplex rRT-PCR assays, using virus isolation with antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays as the reference method. The diagnostic sensitivity of the mRT-PCR assay for FMDV was 93.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.8 to 96.4%), and the sensitivity was 98.1% (95% CI, 95.3 to 99.3%) for the two singleplex rRT-PCR assays used in combination. In addition, the assay could reliably differentiate between FMDV and other vesicular viruses, such as swine vesicular disease virus and vesicular exanthema of swine virus.

To consider the implications for FMD surveillance of using two ELISA in series, a consideration arising from the absence of a gold standard virus neutralisation test (VNT) in New Zealand. Methods: Serum samples from non-infected cattle (n=1, 015), sheep (n=1, 185), and pigs (n=233) from New Zealand were tested in ELISA-1 and ELISA-2 for the detection of serum antibodies against non-structural proteins of the FMD virus. The ELISA were performed according to the manufacturers instructions. Results: The diagnostic specificities for ELISA-1 for cattle, sheep and pigs were 99.9%, 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively, and for ELISA-2 were 99.5%, 99.7% and 99.6%, respectively. False-positive reactors in one ELISA were negative in the other ELISA, and vice versa. Using the diagnostic sensitivity data taken from international studies and the diagnostic specificities calculated in this study resulted in overall specificities of 100% in cattle and sheep using serial test interpretation, and 99.2% and 99.0%, respectively, using parallel test interpretation. Diagnostic sensitivities available in the literature varied considerably, and the associated overall serial sensitivity could be as low as 78.7% in cattle and 33.2% in sheep. Conclusions: Diagnostic specificities for both ELISA for the target population were comparable with those obtained in livestock populations elsewhere. In surveillance to re-establish New Zealands freedom from FMD, the use of two ELISA in series would improve the overall specificity in individual animals. However, care would be required to ensure that herd sensitivity was sufficient to detect infection.  2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2008

An indirect ELISA was established, using purified His-tagged 3ABC fusion protein as antigen, for detection of the antibody response to FMDV NSP 3ABC in different animal species. The method was validated by simultaneous detection of the early antibody responses to NSP and structural protein (SP) in FMDV Asia 1 infected animals. The performance of the method was also validated by detection of antibody in reference sera from the FMD World Reference Laboratory (WRL) in Pirbright, UK, and comparison with two commercial NSP ELISA kits. The results showed that the antibody response to SP developed more quickly than that to NSP 3ABC in FMDV infected animals. In contact-infected cattle, the antibody response to NSP 3ABC was significantly delayed compared with that to SP antibody. The early antibody responses to SP and NSP 3ABC in FMDV inoculated cattle and contact-infected or inoculated sheep and pigs were generally consistent. In pigs, 3ABC antibody was linked to the presence of clinical signs; however, in sheep, subclinical infection was detected by the development of 3ABC antibodies. Therefore, the antibody responses to 3ABC varied between host species. Eight out of 10 positive serum samples from FMD WRL were tested to be positive at cutoff value of 0.2.

The kinetics of the antibody response to NSPs was compared on sequential serum samples in swine from challenge studies and outbreaks. The results showed that ELISA A (UBI) and ELISA B (CEDI) had better sensitivity than that of the 3ABC recombinant protein-based ELISA C (Chekit). The peak for detection of antibodies to NSPs in ELISA C was significantly delayed in sera from natural infection and challenged swine as compared to the ELISA A and B. The sensitivity of the three ELISAs gradually declined during the 6-month post-infection as antibodies to NSP decline. ELISA kits A and B detected NSP antibody in 50% of challenged pigs by the 9-10th-day and 7-8th-day post-challenge, respectively. ELISA B and C had better specificity than ELISA A on sequential serum samples obtained from swine immunized with a type O FMD vaccine commercially available in Taiwan. Antibody to NSPs before vaccination was not detected in swine not exposed to FMD virus, however, antibody to NSPs was found in sera of some pigs after vaccination. All assays had significantly lower specificity when testing sera from repeatedly vaccinated sows and finishers in 1997 that were tested after the 1997 FMD outbreak. However, when testing sera from repeatedly vaccinated sows or finishers in 2003-2004, the specificity for ELISAs A, B and C were significantly better than those in 1997. This effect was less marked for ELISA A. The ELISA B was the best test in terms of the highest sensitivity and specificity and the lowest reactivity with residual NSP in vaccinates.  2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",2007

The nonstructural polyprotein 3ABC has recently been proposed as such an antigen, and a number of diagnostic tests are being developed. This paper evaluates the performance of two FMDV tests for antibodies to nonstructural proteins in an unvaccinated cattle population from a region of Cameroon with endemic multiple-serotype FMD. The CHEKIT-FMD-3ABC bo-ov (CHEKIT) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Bommeli Diagnostics/Intervet) is a commercially available test that was compared with a competitive 3ABC ELISA (C-ELISA) developed in Denmark. The tests were compared with the virus neutralization test as the ""gold standard."" Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were examined over a range of test cutoffs by using receiver operating characteristic curves, which allowed comparison of the overall performance of each test. The results indicated that the CHEKIT ELISA kit was 23% sensitive and 98% specific and the Danish C-ELISA was 71% sensitive and 90% specific at the recommended cutoff. These results have important implications if the tests are to be used to screen herds or individual cattle in surveillance programs, at border crossings for import-export clearance, or following emergency vaccination in an outbreak situation.",2004

To minimise the risk of cross-contamination, we maintained a strict regime for the use of material and laboratories. Preparation of the field samples was carried out in a pre-PCR laboratory. For RT-PCR, three different laboratories were used. Laboratory 1 was used to prepare buffers, and for the storage of stock and working solutions of primers, probes, and PCR kits. Laboratory 2 was used for RNA isolation and to mix reagents for the RT-PCR with the template by adding them to the LightCycler capillaries. The LightCycler thermal cycler was located in laboratory 3. Disposable gloves were worn in all three laboratories, and routing from laboratory 1 to 3 was made obligatory for samples as well as for staff. In the sample preparation laboratory, samples were handled in laminar flow cabinets, using sterile equipment (mortar and pestle, sand, scissors and pairs of tweezers). Samples of the different farms were treated strictly separately. Cabinets were decontaminated using acidified ethanol (70% ethanol supplemented with 5% acetic acid) followed by 15 min irradiation with UV. The exteriors of tubes containing aliquotted samples were decontaminated with acidified ethanol.","not investigated/not given/not relevant","not investigated/not given/not relevant",NA,627,NA,NA,NA,NA,"91.9","100",NA,NA,NA,NA,"not investigated/not given/not relevant",1067,"574161","Other//Other_C","comparison","Moonen, et al. 2003.","Moonen, P., Boonstra, J., Hakze- Van Der Honing, R., Boonstra- Leendertse, C., Jacobs, L., Dekker, A.","Validation of a LightCycler-based reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the detection of foot-and-mouth disease virus","A specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of the polymerase gene (3D) of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) was developed and validated with an analytical sensitivity of equal to, to 1000 times higher than that of a single passage virus isolation.

The outbreak that occurred in Nigeria (2006-2008) was devastating to the poultry industry and raised public health concerns. In the course of its control, rapid laboratory confirmation of suspected cases in poultry was essential for prompt mobilization of control logistics for depopulation and decontamination of affected premises. Commercial rapid test kit was evaluated in the diagnosis of highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) as a preliminary to virus isolation. Between 2006 and 2007, 382 cases were tested out of which 149 were positive by rapid antigen detection. Virus isolation yielded 171 positive cases.

The outbreak that occurred in Nigeria (2006-2008) was devastating to the poultry industry and raised public health concerns. In the course of its control, rapid laboratory confirmation of suspected cases in poultry was essential for prompt mobilization of control logistics for depopulation and decontamination of affected premises. Commercial rapid test kit was evaluated in the diagnosis of highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) as a preliminary to virus isolation. Between 2006 and 2007, 382 cases were tested out of which 149 were positive by rapid antigen detection. Virus isolation yielded 171 positive cases.

In this study, a highly specific and repeatable blocking ELISA (bELISA) was developed using a recombinant p30 protein as the antigen combined with biotinylated mAb against p30 as the detection antibody. Initial test validation included sera from 810 uninfected animals and 106 animals experimentally inoculated with ASFV or recombinant alphavirus/adenovirus expressing p30. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of the data calculated an optimal percentage of inhibition (PI) cutoff value of 45.92%, giving a diagnostic sensitivity of 98.11% and diagnostic specificity of 99.42%. The coefficient of variation of an internal quality control serum was 6.81% for between runs, 6.71% for within run, and 6.14% for within plate. A time course study of infected pigs showed that bELISA was able to detect seroconversion as early as 7 days post-inoculation. Taken together, these results demonstrate that bELISA can be used as an alternative serological test for detecting ASFV infection.  2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2021

The disease is endemic in Sub-Saharan Africa and Sardinia. Since 2007, it has also been present in different countries of Eastern Europe, where control measures have not been effective so far. The continued spread poses a serious threat to the swine industry worldwide. In the absence of vaccine, early detection of infected animals is of paramount importance for control of the outbreak, to prevent the transmission of the virus to healthy animals and subsequent spreading of the disease. Current laboratory diagnosis is mainly based on virological methods (antigen and genome detection) and serodiagnosis. Results: In the present work, a Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) for antigen detection has been developed and evaluated. The test is based on the use of a MAb against VP72 protein of ASFV, the major viral capsid protein and highly immunogenic. First experiments using VP72 viral and recombinant protein or inactivated culture virus showed promising results with a sensitivity similar to that of a commercially available Antigen-ELISA. Moreover, these strips were tested with blood from experimentally infected pigs and field animals and the results compared with those of PCR and Antigen-ELISA. For the experimentally infected samples, there was an excellent correlation between the LFA and the ELISA, while the PCR always showed to be more sensitive (38 % positive samples by PCR versus 27 % by LFA). The LFA was demonstrated to be positive for animals with circulating virus levels exceeding 104 HAU. With the field samples, once again, the PCR detected more positives than either the Antigen-ELISA or LFA, although here the number of positive samples scored by the LFA exceeded the values obtained with the Antigen-ELISA, showing 60 % positivity vs 48 % for the ELISA. For the two groups of sera, the specificity was close to 100 % indicating that hardly any false positive samples were found.

Special features of the course of (ASF and its forms should be considered for the effective use of various ASF diagnostic methods aimed at the pathogen or specific antibody identification. ASF diagnosis in the wild boar is of special importance. The wild boar susceptibility to ASF virus is well known, and the disease has been repeatedly reproduced in experiments and detected in European wild boars in natural conditions. It is not unfrequently that when shooting wild boars, only organ samples are delivered to laboratories, so we decided to estimate the diagnostic value of the antibodies detected in tissues and evaluate an earlier developed test system for its efficacy when used for the assay. This report represents the results of validation of an indirect ELISA (a commercial kit VNIIVViM ASF-ELISA Ab/Ag) ASF virus specific antibody detection in blood serum and spleen tissue extracts. For comparison, an indirect immunofluorescence assay (indirect IFA) was used. To estimate the obtained results, ROC analysis was applied. Examination of positive (n = 66) and negative (n = 410) porcine blood serum samples using indirect ELISA showed high sensitivity and specificity of the method with reference to IFA. Among the 476 serum samples examined in indirect ELISA, only 8 sera (1.6 %) were within the positive/negative cutoff area. The highest sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (99.27 %) for indirect ELISA when examining both domestic pig and wild boar blood sera were determined at a cutoff value of 0.264. The samples of spleen extracts to be used for the study were collected from clinically healthy wild boars in ASF-affected Smolensk region in 2013 to 2014. In view of an acute form of the disease, we can suspect that the animals exhibiting positive reaction were in a latency period of the pathogeny. When examining the positive (n = 59) and negative (n = 678) spleen extracts, we also determined high sensitivity and specificity levels of indirect ELISA with reference to indirect IFA. Among the samples examined (n = 737), 10 (1.3 %) samples of spleen extracts were within the positive/negative cutoff area. The highest sensitivity (100 %) and specificity (98.82 %) were observed at a cutoff value of 0.284. Thus, we confirmed the assay to be effective for porcine blood sera with 100 % sensitivity (94.6 to 100 %) and 99.27 % specificity (97.90 to 99.80 %) and for spleen extracts with 100 % sensitivity (93.90 to 100 %) and 98.82 % specificity (97.70 to 99.50 %).",2016

To detect ASFV, three different PCRs were evaluated in parallel using 785 field and experimental samples. The results showed almost perfect agreement between the Universal ProbeLibrary (UPL-PCR) and the real-time (<U+03BA>=0.94 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.91 to 0.97]) and conventional (<U+03BA>=0.88 [95% CI, 0.83 to 0.92]) World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)-prescribed PCRs.

For ASF antibody detection, five serological methods were tested, including three commercial ELISAs, the OIE-ELISA, and the confirmatory immunoperoxidase test (IPT). Greater sensitivity was obtained with the IPT than with the ELISAs, since the IPT was able to detect ASF antibodies at an earlier point in the serological response, when few antibodies are present. The analysis of the exudate tissues from dead wild boars showed that IPT might be a useful serological tool for determining whether or not animals had been exposed to virus infection, regardless of whether antibodies were present. In conclusion, the UPL-PCR in combination with the IPT was the most trustworthy method for detecting ASF during the epidemic outbreaks affecting EU countries in 2014.

The results showed almost perfect agreement between the Universal ProbeLibrary (UPL-PCR) and the real-time (<U+03BA>=0.94 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.91 to 0.97]) and conventional (<U+03BA>=0.88 [95% CI, 0.83 to 0.92]) World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)-prescribed PCRs. The UPL-PCR had greater diagnostic sensitivity for detecting survivors and allows earlier detection of the disease. Compared to the commercial antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), good-to-moderate agreement (<U+03BA>=0.67 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.76]) was obtained, with a sensitivity of 77.2% in the commercial test. For ASF antibody detection, five serological methods were tested, including three commercial ELISAs, the OIE-ELISA, and the confirmatory immunoperoxidase test (IPT). Greater sensitivity was obtained with the IPT than with the ELISAs, since the IPT was able to detect ASF antibodies at an earlier point in the serological response, when few antibodies are present. The analysis of the exudate tissues from dead wild boars showed that IPT might be a useful serological tool for determining whether or not animals had been exposed to virus infection, regardless of whether antibodies were present. In conclusion, the UPL-PCR in combination with the IPT was the most trustworthy method for detecting ASF during the epidemic outbreaks affecting EU countries in 2014.

To detect ASFV, three different PCRs were evaluated in parallel using 785 field and experimental samples. The results showed almost perfect agreement between the Universal ProbeLibrary (UPL-PCR) and the real-time (<U+03BA>=0.94 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.91 to 0.97]) and conventional (<U+03BA>=0.88 [95% CI, 0.83 to 0.92]) World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)-prescribed PCRs. The UPL-PCR had greater diagnostic sensitivity for detecting survivors and allows earlier detection of the disease. Compared to the commercial antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), good-to-moderate agreement (<U+03BA>=0.67 [95% CI, 0.58 to 0.76]) was obtained, with a sensitivity of 77.2% in the commercial test. For ASF antibody detection, five serological methods were tested, including three commercial ELISAs, the OIE-ELISA, and the confirmatory immunoperoxidase test (IPT). Greater sensitivity was obtained with the IPT than with the ELISAs, since the IPT was able to detect ASF antibodies at an earlier point in the serological response, when few antibodies are present. The analysis of the exudate tissues from dead wild boars showed that IPT might be a useful serological tool for determining whether or not animals had been exposed to virus infection, regardless of whether antibodies were present. In conclusion, the UPL-PCR in combination with the IPT was the most trustworthy method for detecting ASF during the epidemic outbreaks affecting EU countries in 2014.

There is no vaccine, and so reliable diagnosis is essential for control strategies. The performance of four recombinant ASF virus (ASFV) protein (pK205R, pB602L, p104R, and p54)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) was evaluated with European porcine field sera that had been established by Office International des Epizooties (OIE)-approved tests to be ASFV negative (n = 119) and ASFV positive (n = 80). The <U+03BA> values showed that there was almost perfect agreement between the results of the ""gold standard"" test (immunoblotting) and the results obtained by the p54-specific ELISA (<U+03BA> 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 0.99) and the pK205R-specific ELISA or the pB602L-specific ELISA (<U+03BA> 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.97). For the pA104R-specific ELISA, there was substantial to almost perfect agreement (<U+03BA> 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.89). Similar results were observed by the OIE-approved ELISA (<U+03BA> 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.95). Importantly, antibodies against these proteins were detectable early after infection of domestic pigs. Preliminary testing of 9 positive and 17 negative serum samples from pigs from West Africa showed identical results by the recombinant protein-based ELISA and the OIE-approved tests. In contrast, there was a high degree of specificity but a surprisingly a low level of sensitivity with 7 positive and 342 negative serum samples from pigs from East Africa. With poorly preserved sera, only the p104R-specific ELISA showed a significant reduction in sensitivity compared to that of the OIE-approved ELISA. Finally, these recombinant proteins also detected antibodies in the sera of the majority of infected warthogs. Thus, recombinant ASFV proteins p54, pB602L, and pK205R provide sensitive and specific targets for the detection of antibodies in European and West African domestic pigs and warthogs.

There is no vaccine, and so reliable diagnosis is essential for control strategies. The performance of four recombinant ASF virus (ASFV) protein (pK205R, pB602L, p104R, and p54)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) was evaluated with European porcine field sera that had been established by Office International des Epizooties (OIE)-approved tests to be ASFV negative (n = 119) and ASFV positive (n = 80). The <U+03BA> values showed that there was almost perfect agreement between the results of the ""gold standard"" test (immunoblotting) and the results obtained by the p54-specific ELISA (<U+03BA> 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 0.99) and the pK205R-specific ELISA or the pB602L-specific ELISA (<U+03BA> 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.97). For the pA104R-specific ELISA, there was substantial to almost perfect agreement (<U+03BA> 0.81; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.89). Similar results were observed by the OIE-approved ELISA (<U+03BA> 0.89; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.95). Importantly, antibodies against these proteins were detectable early after infection of domestic pigs. Preliminary testing of 9 positive and 17 negative serum samples from pigs from West Africa showed identical results by the recombinant protein-based ELISA and the OIE-approved tests. In contrast, there was a high degree of specificity but a surprisingly a low level of sensitivity with 7 positive and 342 negative serum samples from pigs from East Africa. With poorly preserved sera, only the p104R-specific ELISA showed a significant reduction in sensitivity compared to that of the OIE-approved ELISA. Finally, these recombinant proteins also detected antibodies in the sera of the majority of infected warthogs. Thus, recombinant ASFV proteins p54, pB602L, and pK205R provide sensitive and specific targets for the detection of antibodies in European and West African domestic pigs and warthogs.

Such validation included the following: (i) the scaling up and standardization of p30r production and the associated immunoassays, (ii) a broad immunological analysis using a large number of samples (a total of 672) from Spain and different African locations, and (iii) the detection of the ASF virus (ASFV)-antibody responses at different times after experimental infection. Yields of p30r reached up to 15% of the total protein recovered from the infected larvae at 3 days postinfection. Serological analysis of samples collected in Spain revealed that the p30r-based ELISA presented similar sensitivity to and higher specificity than the conventional Office International des Epizooties-approved ASFV ELISA. Moreover, the p30r ELISA was more sensitive than the conventional ELISA test in detecting ASFV-specific antibodies in experimentally infected animals at early times postinfection. Both the recombinant and conventional ELISAs presented variable rates of sensitivity and specificity with African samples, apparently related to their geographical origin. Comparative analyses performed on the sequences, predicted structures, and antigenicities of p30 proteins from different Spanish and African isolates suggested that variability among isolates might correlate with changes in antigenicity, thus affecting detection by the p30r ELISA. Our estimations indicate that more than 40,000 ELISA determinations and 2,000 confirmatory immunoblotting tests can be performed with the p30r protein obtained from a single infected larva, making this a feasible and inexpensive strategy for production of serological tests with application in developing countries.

The diagnostic Se and Sp of histopathology was higher than expected, confirming the value of routine postmortem examinations and histopathology of liver specimens. Aborted fetuses, however, should be screened using a variety of tests in areas endemic for RVF, and results from severely autolyzed specimens should be interpreted with caution. The most feasible testing option for countries lacking suitably equipped laboratories seems to be routine histology in combination with IHC.  2014 The Author(s).",2014

The severity of autolysis was qualitatively graded as mild, moderate, or severe, and the presence or absence of tissue pigments (i.e., acid hematin, hemosiderin, bilirubin, and lipofuscin) was recorded. Mild autolysis was defined as cases where morphological detail within all the cells and histological structures of the liver was distinct. Moderate autolysis denoted cases where cytoplasmic borders were still distinct, but some cells showed fading of nuclei or stained uniformly eosinophilic; putrefactive bacteria were present. Severe autolysis was defined as cases that showed complete loss of basophilia and where cells had indistinct cytoplasmic borders, nuclei had faded completely, all the red blood cells had lysed, and many putrefactive bacteria were present.","not investigated/not given/not relevant","not investigated/not given/not relevant",NA,380,NA,NA,NA,NA,"94.6","92.3",97.2,91,95.8,87.6,"not investigated/not given/not relevant",1193,"603291","Other//Other_C","comparison","Odendaal, et al. 2014.","Odendaal, L., Fosgate, G.T., Romito, M., Coetzer, J.A.W., Clift, S.J.","Sensitivity and specificity of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, histopathology, and immunohistochemical labeling for the detection of Rift Valley fever virus in naturally infected cattle and sheep","Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), histopathology, and immunohistochemical labeling (IHC) were performed on liver specimens from 380 naturally infected cattle and sheep necropsied during the 2010 Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic in South Africa.

Polyclonal hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluide was used as primary antibody for Wesselsbron virus (WBV) immunolabeling. Rabbit polyclonal antiserumf raised against the Ab4 (neuropathogenic) strain of EHV-1 and monoclonal hyperimmune mouse ascitic fluid to Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1)g was used as primary antibodies for the EHV-1 and BHV-1 immunolabeling, respectively. Twenty of the control specimens were labeled with antibody against RVFV while the remaining 20 were labeled with antibody against EHV-1, BHV-1, or WBV (Table 1).

Four micrometerthick tissue sections were cut from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues and mounted on positively charged microscope slides.h Immunohistochemical labeling was performed manually following previously described methods.23 Briefly, the standard immunoperoxidase method included routine deparaffinizing with 2 changes of xylene, rehydration through graded alcohol baths to distilled water, and incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide. This was followed by heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) or enzymatic digestion (Table 2), followed by blocking of nonspecific epitopes and incubation with the primary antibody. The avidinbiotin complex (ABC) immunoperoxidase detection system was used to detect target antigens in sections treated with anti-RVFV, antiBHV-1, and antiEHV-1 serum. Sections were sequentially incubated with the secondary antibody and the peroxidase-conjugated avidin. To visualize WBV antigen, a polymer detection system was used.i Following incubation with the primary antibody, sections were incubated with the Novolink polymer. For the purpose of contrasting the brownish tissue pigments (especially bile, lipofuscin, or hemosiderin in liver sections) all sections were immersed in a NovaRED substrate.j Sections were then counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin, routinely dehydrated through increasing alcohol concentrations and xylol, mounted using entellan, and coverslipped. The same randomizing and labeling procedure described for the HE slides were performed independently for the immunolabeled slides. Slides were examined by the principal investigator for positive labeling using a light microscope and results were dichotomized as either positive or negative for RVF.","not investigated/not given/not relevant","not investigated/not given/not relevant",NA,380,NA,NA,NA,NA,"97.6","99.4",99.8,93.9,100,96.9,"not investigated/not given/not relevant",1194,"603291","Other//Other_C","comparison","Odendaal, et al. 2014.","Odendaal, L., Fosgate, G.T., Romito, M., Coetzer, J.A.W., Clift, S.J.","Sensitivity and specificity of real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, histopathology, and immunohistochemical labeling for the detection of Rift Valley fever virus in naturally infected cattle and sheep","Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real-time RT-PCR), histopathology, and immunohistochemical labeling (IHC) were performed on liver specimens from 380 naturally infected cattle and sheep necropsied during the 2010 Rift Valley fever (RVF) epidemic in South Africa.

The specificity ranged from 99.29% (sheep) to 100% (camels). Compared to virus neutralisation and haemagglutination-inhibition tests, the ELISA was more sensitive in detection of the earliest immunological responses in experimentally infected and vaccinated sheep.

After incubation, plates were washed three times with 0.1% Tween-20 in PBS; the same washing procedure followed each subsequent stage of the assay. Plates were blocked with 10% skim milk (Merck) in PBS and incubated at 37 C for 1 h. During the blocking stage, a volume of 21 l of each undiluted test and control serum was added into 1 ml diluting tubes containing 189 l of virus antigen or mock antigen pre-diluted 1:9 in 2% skim milk in PBS (diluting buffer). After washing, duplicate volumes of 100 l of each serumantigen mixture was transferred from the diluting tubes into duplicate wells on ELISA plates. Serumvirus antigen mixture were added to rows of the top half of the plate (rows AD: 112) and serummock antigen mixture to the bottom half of the plate (rows EG: 112), respectively. After incubation at 37 C for 1 h, plates were washed and a 100 l volume of mouse anti-virus antibody diluted 1:500, was added. After incubation at 37 C for 1 h, plates were washed and a volume of 100 l of anti-mouse IgG HRPO-conjugate (Zymed Laboratories) diluted 1:1000 was added to wells. After incubation at 37 C for 1 h, plates were washed and 100 l ABTS (2,2'-azino di-ethyl-benzothiazoline-sulfonic acid) peroxidase substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) added to wells. Plates were incubated in the dark for 30 min at room temperature (2225 C). Stop reagent, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, was added and optical densities (OD) were measured at 405 nm. A specific activity of each serum (net OD) was calculated by subtracting the non-specific background OD in the wells with mock antigen from the specific OD in wells with virus antigen. The mean net OD readings for replicate tests were converted to a percentage inhibition (PI) value using the equation: [(100 - (mean net OD of test sample/mean net OD of negative control))  100].","Monolayers of BHK-21 cells in 5 cm  1700 cm expanded surface roller bottles (~2.5  107 cells/bottle), were inoculated with 100 ml of Eagles modified minimal essential medium with 2% foetal calf serum containing log10 100.5 TCID50/ml of the 688/78 strain of RVFV isolated in 1978 from a cow in Zimbabwe (NICD collection). Inoculated bottles were incubated at 37 C for 72 h, after which the infectious cell culture suspensions were pooled into a 1-l sterile glass bottle and gamma-irradiated at 30,000 kGy. After gamma-irradiation, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 2000  g for 15 min, the supernatant fluid aliquoted into 0.5 ml volumes, freeze-dried and stored at +4 C. The titer of the virus in non-gamma-irradiated tissue culture supernatant was log10 108.1 TCID50/ml. The same method was used to produce mock antigen, from uninfected BHK-21 cells.

Polyclonal sheep anti-RVFV was produced as described in Section 2.2.3. Hyperimmune mouse anti-RVFV antibody was produced as described previously (Paweska et al., 2003b). The AN 1830 strain of RVFV (NICD collection) used for the production of mouse antibody, was isolated in 1956 from a sheep in South Africa. Antisera were inactivated at 56 C for 30 min, gamma-irradiated at 24,000 kGy, freeze-dried in 0.2 ml volumes and stored at 4 C.

The safety of antigens and antisera was tested in 23-day-old mice using standard inoculation procedures (Barnard and Gerdes, 2000). Optimization of reagents for the inhibition ELISA was carried out by checkerboard titration (Crowther, 1995).","ELISA cut-off values at 95% accuracy level were selected using the two-graph receiver operating characteristics analysis (TG-ROC) (Greiner, 1995, Greiner et al., 1995).

A total of 3055 sera from sheep (n = 1 159), goats (n = 636), cattle (n = 203), African buffalo (n = 928), and other wild ruminants (n = 129), including eland, kudu, and black wildebeest, was used. Sera from domestic ruminants were collected in West (n = 10), South (n = 1 654) and East Africa (n = 334), and sera from wild ruminants (n = 1 064) were collected in South Africa. In addition, 136 sera from eight experimentally RVFV-infected sheep, taken during a period of 28 days post infection (dpi), were used to study the kinetics of RVFV antibody production. Field sera were tested by the serum neutralization (VN) test and experimental sera by VN and haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. Based on VN test results, negative sera were regarded as reference controls from RVFV-free, and positive sera were regarded as reference controls from RVFV-infected subpopulations of animals. ELISA data were expressed as the percentage positivity (PP) of an internal high positive control. The two-graph receiver operating characteristics approach was used for the selection and optimization of I-ELISA cut-offs including the misclassification costs term and Youden index (J). In addition, cut-off values were determined as the mean plus two-fold standard deviation of the result observed with the RVFV-free subpopulations. Established optimal cut-offs were different for each of the data sets analyzed, and ranged from 1.65 PP (buffalo) to 9.1 PP (goats). At the cut-off giving the highest estimate of combined measure of diagnostic accuracy (highest J value), the I-ELISA test parameters were determined as follows: (1) Diagnostic sensitivity (%): cattle - 84.31, buffalo - 94.44, sheep - 98.91, goats - 99.18 (2) Diagnostic specificity (%): cattle - 99.34, buffalo - 98.28, sheep - 99.16, goats - 99.23 and other game ruminants - 99.26 In the group of RVFV-experimentally infected sheep, seroconversion in all individuals was detected by VN on 4-6 dpi, by HI on 5-7 dpi, and by I-ELISA on 6-7 dpi. All tests showed the same kinetic pattern of immunological response. Antibody levels were low for a very short period before increasing to high titres, after which it was easily detectable by all tests. Compared to traditional tests, the lower sensitivity of I-ELISA in the detection of the earliest stage of immunological response may be practically insignificant, particularly when this assay is used in population-based, disease-surveillance programmes. The high sensitivity and specificity of I-ELISA established in this study, especially for the statistically more representative subpopulations of animals tested, seem to support this prediction. Test parameters determined in this study should, however, be regarded as in-house diagnostic decision limits, for which further updating is recommended, particularly for specimens from other countries, and preferably by applying a standardized method for sampling of new subpopulations of animals to be targeted by the assay.",2003

A total of 3055 sera from sheep (n = 1 159), goats (n = 636), cattle (n = 203), African buffalo (n = 928), and other wild ruminants (n = 129), including eland, kudu, and black wildebeest, was used. Sera from domestic ruminants were collected in West (n = 10), South (n = 1 654) and East Africa (n = 334), and sera from wild ruminants (n = 1 064) were collected in South Africa. In addition, 136 sera from eight experimentally RVFV-infected sheep, taken during a period of 28 days post infection (dpi), were used to study the kinetics of RVFV antibody production. Field sera were tested by the serum neutralization (VN) test and experimental sera by VN and haemagglutination-inhibition (HI) test. Based on VN test results, negative sera were regarded as reference controls from RVFV-free, and positive sera were regarded as reference controls from RVFV-infected subpopulations of animals. ELISA data were expressed as the percentage positivity (PP) of an internal high positive control. The two-graph receiver operating characteristics approach was used for the selection and optimization of I-ELISA cut-offs including the misclassification costs term and Youden index (J). In addition, cut-off values were determined as the mean plus two-fold standard deviation of the result observed with the RVFV-free subpopulations. Established optimal cut-offs were different for each of the data sets analyzed, and ranged from 1.65 PP (buffalo) to 9.1 PP (goats). At the cut-off giving the highest estimate of combined measure of diagnostic accuracy (highest J value), the I-ELISA test parameters were determined as follows: (1) Diagnostic sensitivity (%): cattle - 84.31, buffalo - 94.44, sheep - 98.91, goats - 99.18 (2) Diagnostic specificity (%): cattle - 99.34, buffalo - 98.28, sheep - 99.16, goats - 99.23 and other game ruminants - 99.26 In the group of RVFV-experimentally infected sheep, seroconversion in all individuals was detected by VN on 4-6 dpi, by HI on 5-7 dpi, and by I-ELISA on 6-7 dpi. All tests showed the same kinetic pattern of immunological response. Antibody levels were low for a very short period before increasing to high titres, after which it was easily detectable by all tests. Compared to traditional tests, the lower sensitivity of I-ELISA in the detection of the earliest stage of immunological response may be practically insignificant, particularly when this assay is used in population-based, disease-surveillance programmes.

The PCR test consists of robotized viral RNA isolation from blood samples and an all-in-one method including initial denaturation of genomic double-stranded RNA, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and real-time detection and analysis. Reference strains of the 24 recognized BTV serotypes, isolates from different years, and geographic origins were detected. Other orbiviruses such as African horse sickness virus, Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus, and Equine encephalosis virus were not detected. Experimentally infected animals were PCR positive from 2 days postinoculation, which was earlier than fever, other clinical signs, or seroconversion. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were very close to or even 100%. The PCR test played a key role in the detection of BTV serotype 8 in August 2006 in The Netherlands. The outbreak in a completely naive ruminant population allowed for further evaluation of the PCR test with field samples. In 2006, the correlation between enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PCR results was estimated to be 95%. In the following years, the PCR test was used for diagnosis of diseased animals, for testing of healthy animals for trade purposes, and for detection of BTV RNA in different species of the insect vector, Culicoides. In the autumn of 2008, BTV serotype 6 unexpectedly emerged in northwest Europe and was also detected with the PCR test developed in the current study. The performance in routine use over 5 years has been recorded and evaluated.  2012 The Author(s).",2012

This study used a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to examine quantitative and temporal features of the humoral response of sheep vaccinated with a live-attenuated CPPV strain in Mongolia. Four hundred samples were tested using the ELISA commercial kit, and a subset of 45 samples were also tested with a virus neutralization test (VNT). There was substantial agreement between the VNT and ELISA tests. Antibodies to CPPV were detected between 40 and 262 days post-vaccination. There was no significant difference between serological status (positive/negative) and sex or age; however, an inverse correlation was found between the length of time since vaccination and serological status.

In this study, a recombinant E2 extracellular protein (amino acids 1331) with a native homodimer conformation and high affinity for the anti-CSFV-E2 monoclonal antibody WH303 was expressed using a Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. A novel immunochromatographic test strip based on the recombinant CSFV E2 protein was developed for CSFV antibody detection. The sensitivity of this strip for detecting CSFV standard-positive serum was 1:102400, four times higher than that of the previously developed CnC2 test strip. No cross-reactivity with antibodies of other swine viruses was observed. Detection of clinical swine serum samples (n=813) demonstrated that the agreements of this E2 test strip with three commercial ELISA kits were 97.17% (790/813), 95.94% (780/813) and 93.73% (762/813), respectively. Our data indicate that a novel E2 test strip with enhanced sensitivity has been developed and can be applied for clinical sample detection, providing a new, powerful and simple approach for CSFV antibody monitoring.  2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",2021

Classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotavirus (PoRV) were obtained from our laboratory. Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) genome was a kind gift from professor Shaobin Shang at the College of Veterinary Medicine, Yangzhou University (Yangzhou, Jiangsu, China). The ASFV genome (GenBank accession number MH766894) was a kind gift from professor Rongliang Hu (Institute of Military Veterinary Medicine, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun, China). DNA was extracted by a FastPure Cell/Tissue DNA Isolation Mini Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). Total RNA was extracted with a FastPure Cell/Tissue Total RNA Isolation Kit (Vazyme Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). Reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was conducted using the PrimeScript RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) following the manufacturer's instruction. To avoid template degradation, eluted nucleic acid was appropriately diluted, aliquoted and stored in -70C freezer.


The real-time PCR assay was developed and validated using the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and TaKaRa TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, Dalian, China). With other factors constant, the concentration of primers and annealing temperature were optimized to make the method more specific and sensitive (20). Four concentrations of the primer: 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 M and four different annealing temperatures: 56, 58, 60, 62C were used in the experiment. According to the results, the optimum conditions were determined.","The forward primer A137R-F (5'-GGACATCGAGTGGTATTAAAAGG-3', nt 250272) and the reverse primer A137R-R (5'-TGGCCTGAAAGTCAACATTGA-3', nt 326346) were designed based on the alignment of 100 complete coding sequences (CDS) of the ASFV A137R gene available in the GenBank database (The Genbank accession numbers are shown in Figure 1). The sequences were analyzed using MegAlign and Protean software, version 7.1.0 (DNAstar). The primers were chosen in highly conserved regions of the targeted sequences, and the expected size of the real-time PCR product was 97 bp. The primers A137R-F/A137R-R corresponded to sites that were more conserved than those used in the OIE-recommended TaqMan PCR method (19) (Figure 1). To genotype ASFV in the samples that were positive in the developed assay, the forward primer B646L-F (5'-ATGGCATCAGGAGGAGCTTTTTG-3', nt 123) and the reverse primer B646L-R (5'-TTAGGTACTGTAACGCAGCACAGC-3', nt 19181941) were designed and used for automated dideoxynucleotide cycle sequencing of the B646L (p72) gene.

FMD vaccines are mainly comprised of inactivated virions and stimulate protective antibodies to virus structural proteins. In contrast, infection with FMD virus leads to virus replication and additional antibody responses to viral nonstructural proteins (NSP). Therefore, antibodies against NSPs are used to differentiate infection in vaccinated animals (DIVA), in order to estimate the prevalence of infection or its absence. Another advantage of NSP antibody tests is that they detect FMD infection in the field, irrespective of the serotypes of virus in circulation. In cattle, the NSP tests that target the 3ABC polyprotein provides the highest sensitivity, detecting up to 90% of vaccinated animals that become carriers after exposure to infection, with a specificity of around 99%. Due to insufficient diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, detection of a low level of infection is difficult at the population level with a high degree of confidence. The low level of non-specific responses can be overcome by retesting samples scored positive using a second confirmatory test, which should have at least comparable sensitivity to the first test. In this study, six in-house tests were developed incorporating different NSP antigens, and validated using bovine sera from nave animals, field cases and experimentally vaccinated and/or infected animals. In addition, two (short and long incubation) new commercial NSP tests based on 3ABC competitive blocking ELISAs (ID Screen FMD NSP Competition, IDvet, France) were validated in this study. The two commercial ELISAs had very similar sensitivities and specificities that were not improved by lengthening the incubation period. Several of the new in-house tests had performance characteristics that were nearly as good as the commercial ELISAs. Finally, the in-house tests were evaluated for use as confirmatory tests following screening with the PrioCHECK and ID Screen FMDV NS commercial kits, to assess the diagnostic performance produced by a multiple testing strategy. The in-house tests could be used in series (to confirm) or in parallel (to augment) with the PrioCHECK and IDvet FMDV NS commercial kits, in order to improve either the specificity or sensitivity of the overall test system, although this comes at the cost of a reduction in the counterpart (sensitivity/specificity) parameter.  2021 by the authors.

Therefore, antibodies against NSPs are used to differentiate infection in vaccinated animals (DIVA), in order to estimate the prevalence of infection or its absence. Another advantage of NSP antibody tests is that they detect FMD infection in the field, irrespective of the serotypes of virus in circulation. In cattle, the NSP tests that target the 3ABC polyprotein provides the highest sensitivity, detecting up to 90% of vaccinated animals that become carriers after exposure to infection, with a specificity of around 99%. Due to insufficient diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, detection of a low level of infection is difficult at the population level with a high degree of confidence. The low level of non-specific responses can be overcome by retesting samples scored positive using a second confirmatory test, which should have at least comparable sensitivity to the first test. In this study, six in-house tests were developed incorporating different NSP antigens, and validated using bovine sera from nave animals, field cases and experimentally vaccinated and/or infected animals. In addition, two (short and long incubation) new commercial NSP tests based on 3ABC competitive blocking ELISAs (ID Screen FMD NSP Competition, IDvet, France) were validated in this study. The two commercial ELISAs had very similar sensitivities and specificities that were not improved by lengthening the incubation period. Several of the new in-house tests had performance characteristics that were nearly as good as the commercial ELISAs. Finally, the in-house tests were evaluated for use as confirmatory tests following screening with the PrioCHECK and ID Screen FMDV NS commercial kits, to assess the diagnostic performance produced by a multiple testing strategy. The in-house tests could be used in series (to confirm) or in parallel (to augment) with the PrioCHECK and IDvet FMDV NS commercial kits, in order to improve either the specificity or sensitivity of the overall test system, although this comes at the cost of a reduction in the counterpart (sensitivity/specificity) parameter.  2021 by the authors.

FMD vaccines are mainly comprised of inactivated virions and stimulate protective antibodies to virus structural proteins. In contrast, infection with FMD virus leads to virus replication and additional antibody responses to viral nonstructural proteins (NSP). Therefore, antibodies against NSPs are used to differentiate infection in vaccinated animals (DIVA), in order to estimate the prevalence of infection or its absence. Another advantage of NSP antibody tests is that they detect FMD infection in the field, irrespective of the serotypes of virus in circulation. In cattle, the NSP tests that target the 3ABC polyprotein provides the highest sensitivity, detecting up to 90% of vaccinated animals that become carriers after exposure to infection, with a specificity of around 99%. Due to insufficient diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, detection of a low level of infection is difficult at the population level with a high degree of confidence. The low level of non-specific responses can be overcome by retesting samples scored positive using a second confirmatory test, which should have at least comparable sensitivity to the first test. In this study, six in-house tests were developed incorporating different NSP antigens, and validated using bovine sera from nave animals, field cases and experimentally vaccinated and/or infected animals. In addition, two (short and long incubation) new commercial NSP tests based on 3ABC competitive blocking ELISAs (ID Screen FMD NSP Competition, IDvet, France) were validated in this study. The two commercial ELISAs had very similar sensitivities and specificities that were not improved by lengthening the incubation period. Several of the new in-house tests had performance characteristics that were nearly as good as the commercial ELISAs. Finally, the in-house tests were evaluated for use as confirmatory tests following screening with the PrioCHECK and ID Screen FMDV NS commercial kits, to assess the diagnostic performance produced by a multiple testing strategy. The in-house tests could be used in series (to confirm) or in parallel (to augment) with the PrioCHECK and IDvet FMDV NS commercial kits, in order to improve either the specificity or sensitivity of the overall test system, although this comes at the cost of a reduction in the counterpart (sensitivity/specificity) parameter.  2021 by the authors.

FMD vaccines are mainly comprised of inactivated virions and stimulate protective antibodies to virus structural proteins. In contrast, infection with FMD virus leads to virus replication and additional antibody responses to viral nonstructural proteins (NSP). Therefore, antibodies against NSPs are used to differentiate infection in vaccinated animals (DIVA), in order to estimate the prevalence of infection or its absence. Another advantage of NSP antibody tests is that they detect FMD infection in the field, irrespective of the serotypes of virus in circulation. In cattle, the NSP tests that target the 3ABC polyprotein provides the highest sensitivity, detecting up to 90% of vaccinated animals that become carriers after exposure to infection, with a specificity of around 99%. Due to insufficient diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, detection of a low level of infection is difficult at the population level with a high degree of confidence. The low level of non-specific responses can be overcome by retesting samples scored positive using a second confirmatory test, which should have at least comparable sensitivity to the first test. In this study, six in-house tests were developed incorporating different NSP antigens, and validated using bovine sera from nave animals, field cases and experimentally vaccinated and/or infected animals. In addition, two (short and long incubation) new commercial NSP tests based on 3ABC competitive blocking ELISAs (ID Screen FMD NSP Competition, IDvet, France) were validated in this study. The two commercial ELISAs had very similar sensitivities and specificities that were not improved by lengthening the incubation period.

FMD vaccines are mainly comprised of inactivated virions and stimulate protective antibodies to virus structural proteins. In contrast, infection with FMD virus leads to virus replication and additional antibody responses to viral nonstructural proteins (NSP). Therefore, antibodies against NSPs are used to differentiate infection in vaccinated animals (DIVA), in order to estimate the prevalence of infection or its absence. Another advantage of NSP antibody tests is that they detect FMD infection in the field, irrespective of the serotypes of virus in circulation. In cattle, the NSP tests that target the 3ABC polyprotein provides the highest sensitivity, detecting up to 90% of vaccinated animals that become carriers after exposure to infection, with a specificity of around 99%. Due to insufficient diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, detection of a low level of infection is difficult at the population level with a high degree of confidence. The low level of non-specific responses can be overcome by retesting samples scored positive using a second confirmatory test, which should have at least comparable sensitivity to the first test.

Briefly, the wells of 96 well-flat-bottomed ELISA plate (Maxisorp, Thermo Scientific, USA) were coated with rPPRV-NPN antigen at a rate of 1 g in 100 L volume phosphate-buffered saline-PBS (pH-7.4) solution. After incubation overnight at 4 C, the wells were washed thrice with washing buffer (0.2xPBS) containing 0.1 % Tween 20 = 0.2xPBS-T), followed by blocking with 150 L blocking buffer [1x PBS-T containing 5% Skim-milk powder (HiMedia Laboratories, India) and 3% Lactalbumin hydrolysate (LAH, Sigma-Aldrich, USA)]. After incubation (at 37 C for 1 h) and 3 times washing of the plate, 50 L of dilution buffer (1xPBS-T + 1% chicken serum (HiMedia Laboratories, India), 25 L of 1:3 diluted serum (25 L of serum in 75 L of 1xPBS), and 75 L of diluted (1:30000) GPS-rPPRV-NPN as competitive antibodies were added along with other controls panel (negative, positive, and conjugate) were analyzed and the plate was incubated at 37 C for 1 h. The test sera along with standard positive and negative sera were tested in duplicate wells. The anti-guinea pigIgG Biotin conjugate (Bethyl Laboratorries, Inc, USA) at 1:20000 dilution was added (100 L/well) and incubated at 37 C for 30 min. Then after 3 times washing, Streptavidin hydrogen peroxidase conjugate (Thermo Scientific, USA) in dilution buffer (1:20000) was added (100 L/well) and incubated at 37 C for 30 min. After washing, ready-to-use Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) (Invitrosense, Pvt. Ltd.

The PPRV N-terminal immunogenic region (1266 aa) of nucleoprotein (NPN) coding sequence was amplified and cloned into the pETite vector. The rPPRV-NPN with a molecular weight of ~ 30 kDa was expressed in E. coli, purified, and characterized by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using standard PPRV specific sera. The Ni-NTA affinity-purified rPPRV-NPN as coating antigen and its hyperimmune serum as competitive antibodies raised in guinea pigs were evaluated as diagnostic reagents in ABrC-ELISA using the known standard panel of sera. The threshold (cut-off) Percentage Inhibition (PI) value was determined as 45 (mean  3 SD) based on the reactivity of the known sheep and goats sera to PPRV antibodies [negative (n = 140) and positive (n = 98)] and the assay had a sensitivity of 97 % (95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 91.399.4 %) and specificity of 100 % (95 % CI: 97.4100 %) with an excellent Area under curve (AUC) of 0.997 (95 % CI: 0.991.0). On evaluation of diagnostic performance of the assay using the sheep and goats sera (n = 391) from vaccinated, infected, and non-vaccinated animals, the ABrC-ELISA showed the relative diagnostic sensitivity of 95.88 % (95 % CI: 92.5698.01 %) & 98.77 % (95 % CI: 96.4399.74 %) and diagnostic specificity of 97.97 % (95 % CI: 94.1999.58 %) & 90.54 % (95 % CI: 84.6494.73 %) against indigenous PPR competitive ELISA kit & IDvet Screen PPR Competition kit, respectively. The study showed that ABrC-ELISA is rapid, sensitive, and specific and can be a better alternative assay for the detection of the PPRV antibodies in the sera of small ruminants for serosurveillance / seromonitoring of PPR not only at the eradication and post-eradication phases in the disease-controlled endemic countries but also in the PPR non-endemic countries.  2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021

On evaluation of diagnostic performance of the assay using the sheep and goats sera (n = 391) from vaccinated, infected, and non-vaccinated animals, the ABrC-ELISA showed the relative diagnostic sensitivity of 95.88 % (95 % CI: 92.5698.01 %) & 98.77 % (95 % CI: 96.4399.74 %) and diagnostic specificity of 97.97 % (95 % CI: 94.1999.58 %) & 90.54 % (95 % CI: 84.6494.73 %) against indigenous PPR competitive ELISA kit & IDvet Screen PPR Competition kit, respectively. The study showed that ABrC-ELISA is rapid, sensitive, and specific and can be a better alternative assay for the detection of the PPRV antibodies in the sera of small ruminants for serosurveillance / seromonitoring of PPR not only at the eradication and post-eradication phases in the disease-controlled endemic countries but also in the PPR non-endemic countries.  2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021

The PPRV N-terminal immunogenic region (1266 aa) of nucleoprotein (NPN) coding sequence was amplified and cloned into the pETite vector. The rPPRV-NPN with a molecular weight of ~ 30 kDa was expressed in E. coli, purified, and characterized by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using standard PPRV specific sera. The Ni-NTA affinity-purified rPPRV-NPN as coating antigen and its hyperimmune serum as competitive antibodies raised in guinea pigs were evaluated as diagnostic reagents in ABrC-ELISA using the known standard panel of sera. The threshold (cut-off) Percentage Inhibition (PI) value was determined as 45 (mean  3 SD) based on the reactivity of the known sheep and goats sera to PPRV antibodies [negative (n = 140) and positive (n = 98)] and the assay had a sensitivity of 97 % (95 % Confidence Interval (CI): 91.399.4 %) and specificity of 100 % (95 % CI: 97.4100 %) with an excellent Area under curve (AUC) of 0.997 (95 % CI: 0.991.0).
