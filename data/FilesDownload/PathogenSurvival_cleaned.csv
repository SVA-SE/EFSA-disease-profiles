The onset of the outbreak in grebes was followed by a mortality event in >86 bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). During the die-off, West Nile virus (WNV) was detected by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) or viral culture in the carcasses of grebes and eagles submitted to the National Wildlife Health Center. However, no activity of mosquitoes, the primary vectors of WNV, was detected by the State of Utah's WNV monitoring program. The transmission of WNV has rarely been reported during the winter in North America in the absence of known mosquito activity; however, the size of this die-off, the habitat in which it occurred, and the species involved are unique. We experimentally investigated whether WNV could survive in water with a high salt content, as found at the GSL, and whether brine shrimp, the primary food of migrating eared grebes on the GSL, could have played a role in the transmission of WNV to feeding birds. We found that WNV can survive up to 72 h at 4°C in water containing 30 to 150 ppt NaCl, and brine shrimp incubated with WNV in 30 ppt NaCl may adsorb WNV to their cuticle and, through feeding, infect epithelial cells of their gut.

The shedding of ASFV by infected pigs and the stability of ASFV in the environment will determine the extent of environmental contamination. The recent outbreaks of ASF in Europe make it essential to develop disease transmission models in order to design effective control strategies to prevent further spread of ASF. In this study, we assessed the shedding and stability of ASFV in faeces, urine and oral fluid from pigs infected with the Georgia 2007/1 ASFV isolate. The half-life of infectious ASFV in faeces was found to range from 0.65 days when stored at 4°C to 0.29 days when stored at 37°C, while in urine it was found to range from 2.19 days (4°C) to 0.41 days (37°C). Based on these half-lives and the estimated dose required for infection, faeces and urine would be estimated to remain infectious for 8.48 and 15.33 days at 4°C and 3.71 and 2.88 days at 37°C, respectively. The half-life of ASFV DNA was 8 to 9 days in faeces and 2 to 3 days in oral fluid at all temperatures.

The recent outbreaks of ASF in Europe make it essential to develop disease transmission models in order to design effective control strategies to prevent further spread of ASF. In this study, we assessed the shedding and stability of ASFV in faeces, urine and oral fluid from pigs infected with the Georgia 2007/1 ASFV isolate. The half-life of infectious ASFV in faeces was found to range from 0.65 days when stored at 4°C to 0.29 days when stored at 37°C, while in urine it was found to range from 2.19 days (4°C) to 0.41 days (37°C). Based on these half-lives and the estimated dose required for infection, faeces and urine would be estimated to remain infectious for 8.48 and 15.33 days at 4°C and 3.71 and 2.88 days at 37°C, respectively. The half-life of ASFV DNA was 8 to 9 days in faeces and 2 to 3 days in oral fluid at all temperatures. In urine, the half-life of ASFV DNA was found to be 32.54 days at 4°C decreasing to 19.48 days at 37°C. These results indicate that ASFV in excretions may be an important route of ASFV transmission. © 2015 The Authors. Transboundary and Emerging Diseases Published by Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","2017"

These results indicate that ASFV in excretions may be an important route of ASFV transmission. © 2015 The Authors. Transboundary and Emerging Diseases Published by Blackwell Verlag GmbH.","2017"

A variety of preserved food, such as corned beef, canned meat, bacon, etc., is made of pork products and by-products. Persistence of the virus in these products is not fully understood. For the first time we carried out studies on infectious activity of ASF virus isolates circulating in the Russian Federation, in contaminated pig products, feed, as well as in samples intended for veterinary-sanitary supervision. For this purpose, the 3-4 month-old piglets of 20-30 kg body weight were intramuscularly challenged with virus-containing blood. For inoculation we used ASFV isolate Volgograd-Kalach 2012 with the initial infectious titer of 7.5 lg HAU50/cm3 obtained from the National Collection of the SSINRRIVV&amp;M of RAAS. Three days after infection the animals were slaughtered, samples of internal organs and tissues were taken for virus isolation, and the pork was used for making corned beef, canned meat and salted lard. Blood, containing ASF virus, was also used for contamination of a compound feed and drinking water. To study effects of storage temperature on the virus infectious activity and genome detection, the samples were divided into aliquots and stored at 20-25 °C. (room temperature), 4-6 °C. (a common refrigerator); -16<U+22EF>-20 °C. (freezer). The temperatures selected for the storage of samples conform to the natural weather conditions at various seasons (20-25 °C. in the summer, -16<U+22EF>-20 °C. in winter); 4-6 °C. isolation was carried out in a primary culture of swine bone marrow cells for 5 days in two consecutive passages. Hemadsorption test (HAD) and real-time PCR were conducted for ASFV titer estimation and genome detection. As a result, the ASF virus was found in corned beef and lard stored at 20-25 °C. for 16 days. At storage temperature of 4-6 °C. the ASF virus was revealed in corned beef during the observation period (60 days). In frozen samples the ASFV infectious activity and DNA fragments were found throughout the entire study period (60 days). Thus, it is found that in food products and by-products from pigs slaughtered soon after ASF infecting the ASFV infectivity persists for a long time depending on the storage conditions and can pose a serious danger as a pathogen transmission factor. The data also allow to predict the temperature conditions conducive to maintaining circulation of the virus in.SF outbreaks.","2016"

For the first time we carried out studies on infectious activity of ASF virus isolates circulating in the Russian Federation, in contaminated pig products, feed, as well as in samples intended for veterinary-sanitary supervision. For this purpose, the 3-4 month-old piglets of 20-30 kg body weight were intramuscularly challenged with virus-containing blood. For inoculation we used ASFV isolate Volgograd-Kalach 2012 with the initial infectious titer of 7.5 lg HAU50/cm3 obtained from the National Collection of the SSINRRIVV&amp;M of RAAS. Three days after infection the animals were slaughtered, samples of internal organs and tissues were taken for virus isolation, and the pork was used for making corned beef, canned meat and salted lard. Blood, containing ASF virus, was also used for contamination of a compound feed and drinking water. To study effects of storage temperature on the virus infectious activity and genome detection, the samples were divided into aliquots and stored at 20-25 °C. (room temperature), 4-6 °C. (a common refrigerator); -16<U+22EF>-20 °C. (freezer). The temperatures selected for the storage of samples conform to the natural weather conditions at various seasons (20-25 °C. in the summer, -16<U+22EF>-20 °C. in winter); 4-6 °C. isolation was carried out in a primary culture of swine bone marrow cells for 5 days in two consecutive passages. Hemadsorption test (HAD) and real-time PCR were conducted for ASFV titer estimation and genome detection. As a result, the ASF virus was found in corned beef and lard stored at 20-25 °C. for 16 days. At storage temperature of 4-6 °C. the ASF virus was revealed in corned beef during the observation period (60 days). In frozen samples the ASFV infectious activity and DNA fragments were found throughout the entire study period (60 days). Thus, it is found that in food products and by-products from pigs slaughtered soon after ASF infecting the ASFV infectivity persists for a long time depending on the storage conditions and can pose a serious danger as a pathogen transmission factor. The data also allow to predict the temperature conditions conducive to maintaining circulation of the virus in.SF outbreaks.","2016"

For the first time we carried out studies on infectious activity of ASF virus isolates circulating in the Russian Federation, in contaminated pig products, feed, as well as in samples intended for veterinary-sanitary supervision. For this purpose, the 3-4 month-old piglets of 20-30 kg body weight were intramuscularly challenged with virus-containing blood. For inoculation we used ASFV isolate Volgograd-Kalach 2012 with the initial infectious titer of 7.5 lg HAU50/cm3 obtained from the National Collection of the SSINRRIVV&amp;M of RAAS. Three days after infection the animals were slaughtered, samples of internal organs and tissues were taken for virus isolation, and the pork was used for making corned beef, canned meat and salted lard. Blood, containing ASF virus, was also used for contamination of a compound feed and drinking water. To study effects of storage temperature on the virus infectious activity and genome detection, the samples were divided into aliquots and stored at 20-25 °C. (room temperature), 4-6 °C. (a common refrigerator); -16<U+22EF>-20 °C. (freezer). The temperatures selected for the storage of samples conform to the natural weather conditions at various seasons (20-25 °C. in the summer, -16<U+22EF>-20 °C. in winter); 4-6 °C. isolation was carried out in a primary culture of swine bone marrow cells for 5 days in two consecutive passages. Hemadsorption test (HAD) and real-time PCR were conducted for ASFV titer estimation and genome detection. As a result, the ASF virus was found in corned beef and lard stored at 20-25 °C. for 16 days. At storage temperature of 4-6 °C. the ASF virus was revealed in corned beef during the observation period (60 days). In frozen samples the ASFV infectious activity and DNA fragments were found throughout the entire study period (60 days). Thus, it is found that in food products and by-products from pigs slaughtered soon after ASF infecting the ASFV infectivity persists for a long time depending on the storage conditions and can pose a serious danger as a pathogen transmission factor. The data also allow to predict the temperature conditions conducive to maintaining circulation of the virus in.SF outbreaks.","2016"

Both chlorine and bromine are used by branches of the U.S. military for disinfecting water supplies; however, limited data exists as to the effectiveness of these additives when used against viral biowarfare agents. The present study sought to evaluate the survival of selected viral biothreat agents in disinfected water. Disinfected water samples were spiked with vaccinia virus strain WR and Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus strain TC-83 each separately to a final concentration of approximately 1×106 PFU/mL, and survival was assessed by plaque assay. Both viruses were inactivated by 1mg/L free available chlorine (FAC) and 2mg/L total bromine within one hour. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that both chlorine and bromine are effective disinfectants against vaccinia virus and VEE strain TC-83 at the concentrations tested.

Derner","Infection of Melanoplus sanguinipes grasshoppers following ingestion of rangeland plant species harboring vesicular stomatitis virus","Knowledge of the many mechanisms of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) transmission is critical for understanding of the epidemiology of sporadic disease outbreaks in the western United States. Migratory grasshoppers [Melanoplus sanguinipes (Fabricius)] have been implicated as reservoirs and mechanical vectors of VSV. The grasshopper-cattle-grasshopper transmission cycle is based on the assumptions that (i) virus shed from clinically infected animals would contaminate pasture plants and remain infectious on plant surfaces and (ii) grasshoppers would become infected by eating the virus-contaminated plants. Our objectives were to determine the stability of VSV on common plant species of U.S. Northern Plains rangelands and to assess the potential of these plant species as a source of virus for grasshoppers. Fourteen plant species were exposed to VSV and assayed for infectious virus over time (0 to 24 h). The frequency of viable virus recovery at 24 h postexposure was as high as 73%. The two most common plant species in Northern Plains rangelands (western wheatgrass [Pascopyrum smithii] and needle and thread [Hesperostipa comata]) were fed to groups of grasshoppers. At 3 weeks postfeeding, the grasshopper infection rate was 44 to 50%. Exposure of VSV to a commonly used grasshopper pesticide resulted in complete viral inactivation. This is the first report demonstrating the stability of VSV on rangeland plant surfaces, and it suggests that a significant window of opportunity exists for grasshoppers to ingest VSV from contaminated plants. The use of grasshopper pesticides on pastures would decrease the incidence of a virus-amplifying mechanical vector and might also decontaminate pastures, thereby decreasing the inter- and intraherd spread of VSV.

A potentially prospective approach to reducing the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections of a known or newly emerging microbe is implementation of a broad-spectrum pathogen reduction technology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the susceptibility of WNV to PEN110 inactivation in RBCs and to characterize the WNV interaction with blood, including the stability of WNV in RBCs stored at 1 to 6°C, its distribution and infectivity, and its ability to infect WBCs. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Inactivation was performed with three WNV isolates spiked into WBC-reduced RBCs. The stability of the virus was evaluated by spiking two viral loads into RBCs followed by storing at 1 to 6°C for up to 42 days. The distribution of the virus in plasma, RBCs, and PBMCs was evaluated with whole blood from infected hamsters. Finally, in vitro propagation of WNV was evaluated with the THP-1 cell line and primary monocytes. RESULTS: The kinetics of PEN110 inactivation of WNV isolates RI-44, NJ-176, and 99-3494031 were fast and complete within 24 hours with reduction factors of 5 to 7 log plaque-forming units per mL. WNV remained infectious for up to 42 days at 1 to 6°C. The WNV titers in whole blood, plasma, RBCs, and PBMC fractions were equally distributed and ranged from 2 to 3 log tissue culture infectious dose 50 percent per mL. Productive infection of stimulated monocytes and THP-1 cells was also demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrated that PEN110 efficiently inactivated WNV in RBCs and whole blood from infected hamsters to the limit of detection. WNV survived in RBCs stored at 1 to 6°C with a gradual loss of titer but infectivity could still be observed for up to 42 days.

During winter 2015-2016, several cases of infection caused by highly pathogenic (HP) AIVs belonging to the A/H5N1, A/H5N2, and A/H5N9 subtypes were detected in southwestern France. Throughout winter 2016-2017, several cases of infections caused mainly by A/H5N8 HP AIV (A/goose/GD/1/1996, clade 2.3.4.4) were detected across Europe. On both occasions, the viruses were widely detected on palmiped farms in France. This study was designed to evaluate the persistence of A/H5 HP AIV in slurry from various duck productions. This was achieved (i) in the laboratory setting by artificially spiking four AIV-free slurry samples with known amounts of A/H5N9 HP AIV and monitoring virus infectivity, with or without lime treatment to achieve pH 10 or pH 12, and (ii) by sampling slurry tanks on five naturally A/H5N8 HP-contaminated farms. Experimental results in artificially spiked slurry suggested virus survival for 4 weeks in slurry from Muscovy or Pekin duck breeders and for 2 weeks in slurry from ducks for foie gras production during the assisted-feeding period, without lime treatment. Persistence of infectious A/H5N9 HP AIV in all slurry samples after lime treatment at pH 10 or pH 12 was less than 1 week. The A/H5N8 HP AIV persisted in naturally contaminated untreated slurry for 7 weeks.

IMPORTANCE From November 2015 to July 2017, two successive episodes of H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HP AIVs) infections occurred on poultry farms in France, mostly in domestic ducks raised for foie gras production in southwestern France.

These birds help in the spread of the virus among the poultry and human population through direct or indirect contact. Preen oil is the secretion of preen gland of water birds such as ducks. In a process called preening, the water birds spread preen oil across their feather and body. Preen oil has been known to play a significant role in the accumulation of various pathogens including Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) from water onto feathers. However, the studies are scarce on the role of preen oil in the survivability of HPAIV. We conducted a simulative study to analyse the effect of preen oil on the survivability of the HPAI virus (H5N1) on duck feathers. Duck feather samples along with relevant controls were spiked with the H5N1 virus at two different initial concentrations (104 EID50 and 106 EID50), stored at 37°C, 25°C and 10°C temperatures and tested at regular intervals for percent infectivity by egg culture method and qRT-PCR. The infectivity and viral load were significantly higher in naturally preened duck feathers in comparison to the three preen oil deficit controls at both low and high initial concentrations of virus (104 EID50 and 106 EID50). Maximum persistence was seen at 10°C in naturally preened duck feathers spiked with 106 EID50 concentration of viruses. It was also seen that depletion of preen oil from duck feathers reduced the persistence of the virus. These results demonstrate that preen oil plays a significant role in survivability and protection of HPAIV on duck feathers.

We conducted a simulative study to analyse the effect of preen oil on the survivability of the HPAI virus (H5N1) on duck feathers. Duck feather samples along with relevant controls were spiked with the H5N1 virus at two different initial concentrations (104 EID50 and 106 EID50), stored at 37°C, 25°C and 10°C temperatures and tested at regular intervals for percent infectivity by egg culture method and qRT-PCR. The infectivity and viral load were significantly higher in naturally preened duck feathers in comparison to the three preen oil deficit controls at both low and high initial concentrations of virus (104 EID50 and 106 EID50). Maximum persistence was seen at 10°C in naturally preened duck feathers spiked with 106 EID50 concentration of viruses. It was also seen that depletion of preen oil from duck feathers reduced the persistence of the virus.

Duck feather samples along with relevant controls were spiked with the H5N1 virus at two different initial concentrations (104 EID50 and 106 EID50), stored at 37°C, 25°C and 10°C temperatures and tested at regular intervals for percent infectivity by egg culture method and qRT-PCR. The infectivity and viral load were significantly higher in naturally preened duck feathers in comparison to the three preen oil deficit controls at both low and high initial concentrations of virus (104 EID50 and 106 EID50). Maximum persistence was seen at 10°C in naturally preened duck feathers spiked with 106 EID50 concentration of viruses. It was also seen that depletion of preen oil from duck feathers reduced the persistence of the virus. These results demonstrate that preen oil plays a significant role in survivability and protection of HPAIV on duck feathers.

This provides a guideline for the time required, at specific temperatures to inactivate AIV in poultry litter and likely on surfaces within the house. Heat treatment will provide an added level of safety to personnel and against further spread by eliminating infectious virus prior to cleaning a house. © 2017","2017"

With the use of an established laboratory model system, the persistence of 11 strains of H5N1 HPAI virus was measured in buffered distilled water (pH 7.2) at two temperatures (17 and 28 C) and three salinities (0, 15,000, and 30,000 ppm). There was extensive variation between the 11 H5N1 HPAI virus strains in the overall stability in water, with a range similar to that which has been reported for wild-bird-origin LPAI viruses. The H5N1 HPAI virus strains responded similarly to different water temperatures and salinities, with all viruses being most stable at colder temperatures and fresh to brackish salinities.

With the use of an established laboratory model system, the persistence of 11 strains of H5N1 HPAI virus was measured in buffered distilled water (pH 7.2) at two temperatures (17 and 28 C) and three salinities (0, 15,000, and 30,000 ppm).

The H5N1 HPAI virus strains responded similarly to different water temperatures and salinities, with all viruses being most stable at colder temperatures and fresh to brackish salinities.

Methodology/Principal Findings: The survival of HPAI H5N1 viruses in experimental aquatic biotopes (water, mud, aquatic flora and fauna) relevant to field conditions in Cambodia was investigated. Artificial aquatic biotopes, including simple ones containing only mud and water, and complex biotopes involving the presence of aquatic flora and fauna, were set up. They were experimentally contaminated with H5N1 virus. The persistence of HPAI H5N1 virus (local avian and human isolates) was determined by virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs and by real-time reverse-polymerase chain reaction. Persistence of infectious virus did not exceed 4 days, and was only identified in rain water. No infectious virus particles were detected in pond and lake water or mud even when high inoculum doses were used. However, viral RNA persisted up to 20 days in rain water and 7 days in pond or lake water. Viral RNA was also detected in mud samples, up to 14 days post-contamination in several cases.

Methodology/Principal Findings: The survival of HPAI H5N1 viruses in experimental aquatic biotopes (water, mud, aquatic flora and fauna) relevant to field conditions in Cambodia was investigated. Artificial aquatic biotopes, including simple ones containing only mud and water, and complex biotopes involving the presence of aquatic flora and fauna, were set up. They were experimentally contaminated with H5N1 virus. The persistence of HPAI H5N1 virus (local avian and human isolates) was determined by virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs and by real-time reverse-polymerase chain reaction. Persistence of infectious virus did not exceed 4 days, and was only identified in rain water. No infectious virus particles were detected in pond and lake water or mud even when high inoculum doses were used. However, viral RNA persisted up to 20 days in rain water and 7 days in pond or lake water. Viral RNA was also detected in mud samples, up to 14 days post-contamination in several cases. Infectious virus and viral RNA was detected in few cases in the aquatic fauna and flora, especially in bivalves and labyrinth fish, although these organisms seemed to be mostly passive carriers of the virus rather than host allowing virus replication. Conclusions/Significance: Although several factors for the survival and persistence of HPAI viruses in the environment are still to be elucidated, and are particularly hard to control in laboratory conditions, our results, along with previous data, support the idea that environmental surveillance is of major relevance for avian influenza control programs. © 2012 Horm et al.

The persistence of HPAI H5N1 virus (local avian and human isolates) was determined by virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs and by real-time reverse-polymerase chain reaction. Persistence of infectious virus did not exceed 4 days, and was only identified in rain water. No infectious virus particles were detected in pond and lake water or mud even when high inoculum doses were used. However, viral RNA persisted up to 20 days in rain water and 7 days in pond or lake water. Viral RNA was also detected in mud samples, up to 14 days post-contamination in several cases. Infectious virus and viral RNA was detected in few cases in the aquatic fauna and flora, especially in bivalves and labyrinth fish, although these organisms seemed to be mostly passive carriers of the virus rather than host allowing virus replication. Conclusions/Significance: Although several factors for the survival and persistence of HPAI viruses in the environment are still to be elucidated, and are particularly hard to control in laboratory conditions, our results, along with previous data, support the idea that environmental surveillance is of major relevance for avian influenza control programs. © 2012 Horm et al.

Methodology/Principal Findings: The survival of HPAI H5N1 viruses in experimental aquatic biotopes (water, mud, aquatic flora and fauna) relevant to field conditions in Cambodia was investigated. Artificial aquatic biotopes, including simple ones containing only mud and water, and complex biotopes involving the presence of aquatic flora and fauna, were set up. They were experimentally contaminated with H5N1 virus. The persistence of HPAI H5N1 virus (local avian and human isolates) was determined by virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs and by real-time reverse-polymerase chain reaction. Persistence of infectious virus did not exceed 4 days, and was only identified in rain water. No infectious virus particles were detected in pond and lake water or mud even when high inoculum doses were used. However, viral RNA persisted up to 20 days in rain water and 7 days in pond or lake water. Viral RNA was also detected in mud samples, up to 14 days post-contamination in several cases. Infectious virus and viral RNA was detected in few cases in the aquatic fauna and flora, especially in bivalves and labyrinth fish, although these organisms seemed to be mostly passive carriers of the virus rather than host allowing virus replication. Conclusions/Significance: Although several factors for the survival and persistence of HPAI viruses in the environment are still to be elucidated, and are particularly hard to control in laboratory conditions, our results, along with previous data, support the idea that environmental surveillance is of major relevance for avian influenza control programs. © 2012 Horm et al.

Methodology/Principal Findings: The survival of HPAI H5N1 viruses in experimental aquatic biotopes (water, mud, aquatic flora and fauna) relevant to field conditions in Cambodia was investigated. Artificial aquatic biotopes, including simple ones containing only mud and water, and complex biotopes involving the presence of aquatic flora and fauna, were set up. They were experimentally contaminated with H5N1 virus. The persistence of HPAI H5N1 virus (local avian and human isolates) was determined by virus isolation in embryonated chicken eggs and by real-time reverse-polymerase chain reaction. Persistence of infectious virus did not exceed 4 days, and was only identified in rain water. No infectious virus particles were detected in pond and lake water or mud even when high inoculum doses were used. However, viral RNA persisted up to 20 days in rain water and 7 days in pond or lake water. Viral RNA was also detected in mud samples, up to 14 days post-contamination in several cases. Infectious virus and viral RNA was detected in few cases in the aquatic fauna and flora, especially in bivalves and labyrinth fish, although these organisms seemed to be mostly passive carriers of the virus rather than host allowing virus replication. Conclusions/Significance: Although several factors for the survival and persistence of HPAI viruses in the environment are still to be elucidated, and are particularly hard to control in laboratory conditions, our results, along with previous data, support the idea that environmental surveillance is of major relevance for avian influenza control programs. © 2012 Horm et al.

Rapid identification of infectious individuals or animals is crucial not only for avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance programmes, but also for treatment and containment strategies. This study used a combination of quantitative real-time RT-PCR with an internal positive control and a cell-titration system to examine the presence of virus in different samples during active experimental AIV infection and its persistence in the infected carcasses. Oropharyngeal/cloacal swabs as well as feather pulp and blood samples were collected from 15-day-old chicks infected with H7N1 highly pathogenic AIV (HPAIV) and the kinetics of virus shedding during active infection were evaluated. Additionally, several samples (muscle, skin, brain, feather pulp and oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs) were examined to assess the persistence of virus in the HPAIV-infected carcasses. Based on the results, feather pulp was found to be the best sample to detect and isolate HPAIV from infected chicks from 24 h after inoculation onwards. Kinetic studies on the persistence of virus in infected carcasses revealed that tissues such as muscle could potentially transmit infectious virus for 3 days post-mortem (p.m.), whilst other tissues such as skin, feather pulp and brain retained their infectivity for as long as 5-6 days p.m. at environmental temperature (22-23 °C).

We investigated avian influenza virus (H5N1) persistence in feathers detached from bodies of infected ducks to evaluate their potential risk for environmental contamination. Four-week-old domestic ducks were inoculated with different clades of avian influenza virus (H5N1). Feathers, drinking water, and feces were collected on day 3 postinoculation and stored at 4°C or 20°C. Viral persistence in samples was investigated for 360 days by virus isolation and reverse transcription-PCR. Infectious viruses persisted for the longest period in feathers, compared with drinking water and feces, at both 4°C and 20°C. Viral infectivity persisted in the feathers for 160 days at 4°C and for IS days at 20°C. Viral titers of 104.3 50% egg infectious doses/ml or greater were detected for 120 days in feathers stored at 4°C. Viral RNA in feathers was more stable than the infectivity.

We investigated avian influenza virus (H5N1) persistence in feathers detached from bodies of infected ducks to evaluate their potential risk for environmental contamination. Four-week-old domestic ducks were inoculated with different clades of avian influenza virus (H5N1). Feathers, drinking water, and feces were collected on day 3 postinoculation and stored at 4°C or 20°C. Viral persistence in samples was investigated for 360 days by virus isolation and reverse transcription-PCR. Infectious viruses persisted for the longest period in feathers, compared with drinking water and feces, at both 4°C and 20°C. Viral infectivity persisted in the feathers for 160 days at 4°C and for IS days at 20°C. Viral titers of 104.3 50% egg infectious doses/ml or greater were detected for 120 days in feathers stored at 4°C. Viral RNA in feathers was more stable than the infectivity. These results indicate that feathers detached from domestic ducks infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) can be a source of environmental contamination and may function as fomites with high viral loads in the environment.

In this study we artificially infected four egg products with two AI (one low [LP] and one high pathogenicity [HP]) and three ND (two low and one highly virulent) viruses, and determined inactivation curves at 55, 57, 59, 61 and 63°C. Based on Dt values, the time to inactivation of the viruses was dependent on virus strain and egg product, and was directly related to virus titre, but inversely related to temperature. For all temperatures, the five viruses had the most rapid and complete inactivation in 10% salt yolk, while the most resistant to inactivation was HPAI virus in dried egg white. This study demonstrated that the LPAI and all ND viruses were inactivated in all egg products when treated using industry standard pasteurization protocols. By contrast, the HPAI virus was inactivated in liquid egg products but not in dried egg whites when using the low-temperature industry pasteurization protocol.","2004"

The current investigation was prospectively designed to address two major gaps in current knowledge of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) pathogenesis in pigs: the end (duration) of the infectious period and the viability of FMDV in decaying carcasses. By serial exposure of sentinel groups of pigs to the same group of donor pigs infected by FMDV A24 Cruzeiro, it was demonstrated that infected pigs transmitted disease at 10 days post infection (dpi), but not at 15 dpi. Assuming a latent period of 1 day, this would result in a conservative estimate of an infectious duration of 9 days, which is considerably longer than suggested by a previous report from an experiment performed in cattle. Airborne contagion was diminished within two days of removal of infected pigs from isolation rooms. FMDV in muscle was inactivated within 7 days in carcasses stored at 4oC. By contrast, FMDV infectivity in vesicle epithelium harvested from intact carcasses stored under similar conditions remained remarkably high until the study termination at 11 weeks post mortem.

Under these conditions, FMD virus was inactivated in specimens in compost by day 10 and the viral RNA was degraded in skin and internal organ tissues by day 21. In comparison, at ambient temperatures close to 20°C, FMD virus survived to day 10 in the skin tissue specimen from the pig that had the highest initial level of viral RNA in its tissues and the viral RNA persisted to day 21. Similarly, beta-actin mRNA, tested as a PCR control, persisted to day 21 in specimens held at ambient temperatures, but it was degraded in the remnants of tissues recovered from compost on day 21. Results from this study provide evidence that composting could be used for safe disposal of pig carcasses infected with FMD virus.","2010"

The fleeces of 3 of the sheep were contaminated with FMDV at 2 days post exposure (dpe), while at 5 dpe the fleeces of all 5 sheep were more extensively, and more heavily, contaminated. The persistence of FMDV on contaminated wool was examined in vitro using multiple 0.5 g samples of Merino wool that were each contaminated with one of 3 strains of FMDV in tissue-culture medium: O1-BFS, O-Morocco (O-MOR 9/91) or an Asia 1 strain (TAI 1/90). Wool samples were held at either 4°C, 18°C or 37°C, and decay curves were established for each virus at each temperature. These curves predicted that O1-BFS, O-MOR 9/91 and TAI 1/90 would fall below detect-able levels at 72, 70 and 48 days post contamination (pc), respectively, for wool stored at 4°C; at 11, 12 and 12 days pc, respectively, for wool stored at 18°C; and at 57, 68 and 33 hours pc, respectively, for wool stored at 37°C. For wool contaminated with O1-BFS-infected sheep faeces, urine or blood, or with O1-BFS-infected cattle saliva, decay curves predicted virus to persist for 5 to 11 days pc at 18°C. We demonstrated that the simulated scouring of FMDV-contaminated wool at 60° to 70°C would usually reduce virus to below detectable levels. The detergent component of the scouring process had little, if any, antiviral activity, and scouring at 20°C or 50°C had limited impact on FMDV titres. We recommend that either (1) simple storage of FMDV-contaminated wool for 4 weeks at temperatures of 18°C or higher, or (2) scouring of contaminated wool at 60° to 70°C would be sufficient to remove the threat of FMDV-contaminated wool being infectious to other animals.

For wool contaminated with O1-BFS-infected sheep faeces, urine or blood, or with O1-BFS-infected cattle saliva, decay curves predicted virus to persist for 5 to 11 days pc at 18°C. We demonstrated that the simulated scouring of FMDV-contaminated wool at 60° to 70°C would usually reduce virus to below detectable levels. The detergent component of the scouring process had little, if any, antiviral activity, and scouring at 20°C or 50°C had limited impact on FMDV titres. We recommend that either (1) simple storage of FMDV-contaminated wool for 4 weeks at temperatures of 18°C or higher, or (2) scouring of contaminated wool at 60° to 70°C would be sufficient to remove the threat of FMDV-contaminated wool being infectious to other animals.

Nowadays, milk products are often treated chemically with acids or with hydrogen peroxide in order to keep bacterial contamination low. The capacity of these chemical treatments to inactivate FMD virus in skimmed milk within 6 h at 5 degrees C was tested in this study. The results indicated that the addition of 0.1%-0.3% of consumable acids, such as citric acid or propionic acid, could not guarantee the complete inactivation of FMD virus in skimmed milk. Similar results were obtained both with FMD virus deliberately added to skimmed milk and with skimmed milk obtained from naturally infected cows. Hydrogen peroxide in concentrations of 0.1%-0.3% was also an ineffective means of controlling the risk of FMD virus transmission from contaminated milk.","1990"

Five treatment groups were established (each with four pigs). Group A: Pigs that were fed with processed hams from negative animals; Group B: Pigs that were fed with processed hams from commercial pigs inoculated with the ALD (reference strain) (titre of 104.0/ml); Group C: Pigs fed with processed hams from pigs infected with the virulent ALD strain (titre of 102.5/ml); Group D: Pigs fed with processed hams from pigs vaccinated with the PAV-250 strain and challenged with the ALD strain (titre of 101.1/ml); and Group E: Pigs fed with processed hams from pigs vaccinated with two doses of the PAV-250 strain and challenged with the ALD strain (negative). Blood samples were taken at d 1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 for biometric analysis. Groups B, C and D manifested clinical signs of CSFv: 40 °C temperature, anorexia, paralysis, vomiting, diarrhea, tremor, hirsute hair and cyanosis. Pigs were slaughtered and necropsies performed to identify lesions in tissues. Results of direct immunofluorescence testing of tissues were positive and the virus was recovered. Under these study conditions, it was found that CSFv resisted the cooking method at 68 °C for 40 min in hams from unvaccinated pigs, and that the virus was able to transmit the disease to healthy unvaccinated pigs, whereas the hams from the vaccinated animals did not transmit the virus. © 2019 INIFAP-CENID Parasitologia Veterinaria.

Using material from pigs infected with CSFV, we determined the viable virus concentrations in tissues that comprise the majority of pork products. Decimal reduction values (D values), the time required to reduce the viable virus load by 90% (or 1log10), were determined at temperatures of relevance for chilling, cooking, composting and ambient storage. The rate of CSFV inactivation varied in different tissues. At lower temperatures, virus remained viable for substantially longer in muscle and serum compared to lymphoid and fat tissues. To enable estimation of the temperature dependence of inactivation, the temperature change required to change the D values by 90% (Z values) were determined as 13°C, 14°C, 12°C and 10°C for lymph node, fat, muscle and serum, respectively. The amount of virus required to infect 50% of pigs by ingestion was determined by feeding groups of animals with moderately and highly virulent CSFV.

Next, the virus titres were determined in the samples by virus titration, and a random selection of these samples was also analyzed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRRT-PCR) to determine the viral RNA decay. Survival curves were generated, and it was shown that the inactivation rate was inversely related to the storage temperature. Average half-life values were between 2 and 4 days at 5 °C, and between 1 and 3 h at 30 °C. Significant differences were observed in survival between virus strains in faeces, however, not in urine. The reduction in viral RNA during the entire study period was limited. This study provided detailed information on survival of CSFV in excretions of infected pigs, which can be used to improve control measures or risk-analysis models. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated different soil matrices spiked with ASFV-positive blood from infected wild boar to see if ASFV can remain infectious in the soil beneath infected carcasses. As expected, ASFV genome detection was possible over the entire sampling period. Soil pH, structure, and ambient temperature played a role in the stability of infectious ASFV. Infectious ASFV was demonstrated in specimens originating from sterile sand for at least three weeks, from beach sand for up to two weeks, from yard soil for one week, and from swamp soil for three days. The virus was not recovered from two acidic forest soils. All risk mitigation experiments with citric acid or calcium hydroxide resulted in complete inactivation. In conclusion, the stability of infectious ASFV is very low in acidic forest soils but rather high in sandy soils. However, given the high variability, treatment of carcass collection points with disinfectants should be considered. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","2020"

We evaluated the tenacity of ASF virus (ASFV) in tissues and body fluids from experimentally infected domestic pigs and wild boar, which were stored on different matrices and at different temperatures. Samples were analysed at regular intervals for viral genome and infectious virus. ASFV was most stable in spleen or muscles stored at -20 °C and in blood stored at 4 °C. In bones stored at -20 °C, infectious virus was detected for up to three months, and at 4 °C for up to one month, while at room temperature (RT), no infectious virus could be recovered after one week. Skin stored at -20 °C, 4 °C and RT remained infectious for up to three, six and three months, respectively.

In urine and faeces, no infectious virus was recovered after one week, irrespective of the matrix. In conclusion, tissues and organs from decomposing carcasses that persist in the environment for a long time can be a source of infection for several months, especially at low temperatures. © 2020 by the authors.

There is great concern that carcasses of infected wild boar may act as long-term virus reservoirs in the environment. We evaluated the tenacity of ASF virus (ASFV) in tissues and body fluids from experimentally infected domestic pigs and wild boar, which were stored on different matrices and at different temperatures. Samples were analysed at regular intervals for viral genome and infectious virus. ASFV was most stable in spleen or muscles stored at -20 °C and in blood stored at 4 °C. In bones stored at -20 °C, infectious virus was detected for up to three months, and at 4 °C for up to one month, while at room temperature (RT), no infectious virus could be recovered after one week. Skin stored at -20 °C, 4 °C and RT remained infectious for up to three, six and three months, respectively. In urine and faeces, no infectious virus was recovered after one week, irrespective of the matrix. In conclusion, tissues and organs from decomposing carcasses that persist in the environment for a long time can be a source of infection for several months, especially at low temperatures. © 2020 by the authors.

We evaluated the tenacity of ASF virus (ASFV) in tissues and body fluids from experimentally infected domestic pigs and wild boar, which were stored on different matrices and at different temperatures. Samples were analysed at regular intervals for viral genome and infectious virus. ASFV was most stable in spleen or muscles stored at -20 °C and in blood stored at 4 °C. In bones stored at -20 °C, infectious virus was detected for up to three months, and at 4 °C for up to one month, while at room temperature (RT), no infectious virus could be recovered after one week. Skin stored at -20 °C, 4 °C and RT remained infectious for up to three, six and three months, respectively.

In bones stored at -20 °C, infectious virus was detected for up to three months, and at 4 °C for up to one month, while at room temperature (RT), no infectious virus could be recovered after one week. Skin stored at -20 °C, 4 °C and RT remained infectious for up to three, six and three months, respectively. In urine and faeces, no infectious virus was recovered after one week, irrespective of the matrix. In conclusion, tissues and organs from decomposing carcasses that persist in the environment for a long time can be a source of infection for several months, especially at low temperatures. © 2020 by the authors.

There is great concern that carcasses of infected wild boar may act as long-term virus reservoirs in the environment. We evaluated the tenacity of ASF virus (ASFV) in tissues and body fluids from experimentally infected domestic pigs and wild boar, which were stored on different matrices and at different temperatures. Samples were analysed at regular intervals for viral genome and infectious virus. ASFV was most stable in spleen or muscles stored at -20 °C and in blood stored at 4 °C. In bones stored at -20 °C, infectious virus was detected for up to three months, and at 4 °C for up to one month, while at room temperature (RT), no infectious virus could be recovered after one week. Skin stored at -20 °C, 4 °C and RT remained infectious for up to three, six and three months, respectively. In urine and faeces, no infectious virus was recovered after one week, irrespective of the matrix. In conclusion, tissues and organs from decomposing carcasses that persist in the environment for a long time can be a source of infection for several months, especially at low temperatures. © 2020 by the authors.

In bones stored at -20 °C, infectious virus was detected for up to three months, and at 4 °C for up to one month, while at room temperature (RT), no infectious virus could be recovered after one week. Skin stored at -20 °C, 4 °C and RT remained infectious for up to three, six and three months, respectively. In urine and faeces, no infectious virus was recovered after one week, irrespective of the matrix. In conclusion, tissues and organs from decomposing carcasses that persist in the environment for a long time can be a source of infection for several months, especially at low temperatures. © 2020 by the authors.

We evaluated the tenacity of ASF virus (ASFV) in tissues and body fluids from experimentally infected domestic pigs and wild boar, which were stored on different matrices and at different temperatures. Samples were analysed at regular intervals for viral genome and infectious virus. ASFV was most stable in spleen or muscles stored at -20 °C and in blood stored at 4 °C. In bones stored at -20 °C, infectious virus was detected for up to three months, and at 4 °C for up to one month, while at room temperature (RT), no infectious virus could be recovered after one week. Skin stored at -20 °C, 4 °C and RT remained infectious for up to three, six and three months, respectively. In urine and faeces, no infectious virus was recovered after one week, irrespective of the matrix. In conclusion, tissues and organs from decomposing carcasses that persist in the environment for a long time can be a source of infection for several months, especially at low temperatures. © 2020 by the authors.

The causative African swine fever virus (ASFV) is known to be very stable in the environment. Thus, carcasses of infected wild boar could play a major role as ASFV reservoir and thereby help to locally maintain and spread the disease in wild boar populations. To minimize this risk, removal of wild boar carcasses in ASF affected areas is regarded to be crucial for effective disease control. If removal is not feasible, carcasses are usually disposed by burial on the spot to avoid direct contact of wild boar to the infection source. In this study, carcasses of ASFV infected wild boar buried in Lithuania at different time points and locations have been excavated and retested for the presence of infectious ASFV by in vitro assays and for viral genome by qPCR. Soil samples potentially contaminated by body fluids have been additionally tested for viral genome. In seventeen out of twenty burial sites, samples of excavated carcasses were positive for ASFV genome. However, in none of the carcass samples ASFV could be isolated. On seven sites soil samples contained ASF viral DNA. These results unexpectedly negate the long-term persistence of infectious ASFV in wild boar carcasses independent from the burial time. In this context, sensitivity of ASFV isolation from carcass samples versus susceptibility of animals and doses needed for oral inoculation has to be further investigated.

The causative African swine fever virus (ASFV) is known to be very stable in the environment. Thus, carcasses of infected wild boar could play a major role as ASFV reservoir and thereby help to locally maintain and spread the disease in wild boar populations. To minimize this risk, removal of wild boar carcasses in ASF affected areas is regarded to be crucial for effective disease control. If removal is not feasible, carcasses are usually disposed by burial on the spot to avoid direct contact of wild boar to the infection source. In this study, carcasses of ASFV infected wild boar buried in Lithuania at different time points and locations have been excavated and retested for the presence of infectious ASFV by in vitro assays and for viral genome by qPCR. Soil samples potentially contaminated by body fluids have been additionally tested for viral genome. In seventeen out of twenty burial sites, samples of excavated carcasses were positive for ASFV genome. However, in none of the carcass samples ASFV could be isolated. On seven sites soil samples contained ASF viral DNA. These results unexpectedly negate the long-term persistence of infectious ASFV in wild boar carcasses independent from the burial time. In this context, sensitivity of ASFV isolation from carcass samples versus susceptibility of animals and doses needed for oral inoculation has to be further investigated.

The causative African swine fever virus (ASFV) is known to be very stable in the environment. Thus, carcasses of infected wild boar could play a major role as ASFV reservoir and thereby help to locally maintain and spread the disease in wild boar populations. To minimize this risk, removal of wild boar carcasses in ASF affected areas is regarded to be crucial for effective disease control. If removal is not feasible, carcasses are usually disposed by burial on the spot to avoid direct contact of wild boar to the infection source. In this study, carcasses of ASFV infected wild boar buried in Lithuania at different time points and locations have been excavated and retested for the presence of infectious ASFV by in vitro assays and for viral genome by qPCR. Soil samples potentially contaminated by body fluids have been additionally tested for viral genome. In seventeen out of twenty burial sites, samples of excavated carcasses were positive for ASFV genome. However, in none of the carcass samples ASFV could be isolated. On seven sites soil samples contained ASF viral DNA. These results unexpectedly negate the long-term persistence of infectious ASFV in wild boar carcasses independent from the burial time. In this context, sensitivity of ASFV isolation from carcass samples versus susceptibility of animals and doses needed for oral inoculation has to be further investigated. Furthermore, research is required to consider alternative ASF infection sources and drivers in the infection cycle among wild boar. © 2020 The Authors.

A nonlinear regression model was developed to predict T ½ for temperatures between -20 °C and +23 °C. The half-life of the infectious ASFV in tissues ranged from 31.95 days at -20 °C to 0.38 days at +23 °C, with estimated D-values between 106.121.27 days, respectively. In order to assess the influence of environmental conditions on the rate of ASFV inactivation in decomposing tissue, viral half-life was evaluated at +4 °C and +23 °C in tissues stored within various matrices, mimicking possible natural conditions. Water, soil and leaf litter presence induced significantly faster ASFV inactivation. Straw, hay and grain provided stable conditions and prolonged virus viability for a considerable amount of time. In contrast to viable virus reduction over time, no change in ASFV DNA concentration was detected by real-time PCR.

Risk assessment of the disease spreading requires quantitative knowledge about time and conditions needed for its inactivation in various material of pig origin. In this study we aimed to assess ASFV stability in naturally contaminated tissues during storage in selected environmental conditions. Virus half-life (T ½) and decimal reduction rate (D-value) were determined for temperatures relevant for freezing, chilling and ambient storage. A nonlinear regression model was developed to predict T ½ for temperatures between -20 °C and +23 °C. The half-life of the infectious ASFV in tissues ranged from 31.95 days at -20 °C to 0.38 days at +23 °C, with estimated D-values between 106.121.27 days, respectively. In order to assess the influence of environmental conditions on the rate of ASFV inactivation in decomposing tissue, viral half-life was evaluated at +4 °C and +23 °C in tissues stored within various matrices, mimicking possible natural conditions. Water, soil and leaf litter presence induced significantly faster ASFV inactivation. Straw, hay and grain provided stable conditions and prolonged virus viability for a considerable amount of time. In contrast to viable virus reduction over time, no change in ASFV DNA concentration was detected by real-time PCR. Based on estimated half-life values, the investigated tissues are predicted to remain infectious for 353713 days at -20 °C, 35136 days at +4 °C, and from 9 to 17 days at +23 °C.

Disease caused by the ASF virus (ASFV) results in high case fatality of pigs. Importantly, ASF is a trade-limiting disease with substantial implications on both global pork and agricultural feed commodities. ASFV is transmissible through natural consumption of contaminated swine feed and is broadly stable across a wide range of commonly imported feed ingredients and conditions. The objective of the current study was to investigate the efficacy of medium-chain fatty acid and formaldehyde-based feed additives in inactivating ASFV. Feed additives were tested in cell culture and in feed ingredients under a transoceanic shipment model. Both chemical additives reduced ASFV infectivity in a dose-dependent manner. This study provides evidence that chemical feed additives may potentially serve as mitigants for reducing the risk of ASFV introduction and transmission through feed. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","2020"

Cheese samples were made on a laboratory scale with commercial lactic acid starter cultures and the microbial protease MARZYME as a coagulant. Milk was heated at different temperatures for different intervals before it was made into cheese. Foot-and-mouth disease virus survived the acidic conditions of Cheddar and Camembert cheese processing but not that of Mozzarella. Foot-and-mouth disease virus survived processing but not curing for 30 days in Cheddar cheese prepared from heated milk. However, the virus survived curing for 60 days but not for 120 days in cheese (pH 5) prepared from unheated milk. Foot-and-mouth disease virus survived in Camembert cheese (pH 5) for 21 days at 2 C but not for 35 days. © 1976, American Dairy Science Association. All rights reserved.","1976"

Das ND-Virus hatte in pestinfizierten Schlacht-hühnern, die bei  20° C eingelagert waren, eine Überlebensdauer von 836 Tagen und mehr. In vergrabenen Hühnerkadavern wurde das Virus bei 2 Hühnern im Knochenmark noch nach 56 bzw. 121 Tagen nachweisbar. Bei 76 Schlachthähnchen, die in einer Farm, in der die Newcastle-Disease einen milden Verlauf zeigte, zur Schlachtung kamen, verliefen die virologischen Untersuchungen negativ. Zwecks verbesserter Seuchenprophylaxe wird eine Stichprobenuntersuchung von importiertem Schlachtgeflügel aus Ländern, in denen die Newcastle-Disease vorkommt, vorgeschlagen. Studies on the survival of Newcastle disease in imported and homeproduced poultry The carcases of 517 poultry exposed for sale and coming from a number of countries, (America, Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Finland, Denmark, Holland and Germany) were examined for the presence of N.D. virus. A virus pathogenic for chicks was found in one instance in hens among a batch of birds from Holland. In birds slaughtered when affected with N.D. and kept at minus 20° C, the virus survived 836 days and longer. In buried carcases, the virus was demonstrable in 2 hens after 56 + 121 days, respectively. In 76 hens slaughtered on a farm where N.D. was present in a mild form, the virological studies were negative. For better control of the disease it is suggested that samples of imported poultry carcases from countries where N.D. occurs should be tested for the presence of the virus. Recherches sur le virus de Newcastle chez des volailles de consommation et sur sa durée de survie On rechercha le virus de la maladie de Newcastle chez 517 pièces de volailles de consommation d'origine américaine, polonaise, hongroise, yougoslave, finnoise, danoise, hollandaise et allemande qui se trouvaient dans le commerce. Dans un cas on trouva chez des poules de provenance hollandaise un virus pathogène pour les poussins. Chez les poules infestées, entreposées à une température de  20° C., le virus de Newcastle présenta une durée de survie de 836 jours et plus. Dans des cadavres de 2 poules enterrées depuis 56, resp. 121 jours on décela le virus dans la moelle osseuse. Chez 76 poules de consommation provenant d'une ferme où la maladie de Newcastle présentait un cours bénin, les examens virologiques furent négatifs. Dans le but d'améliorer la prophylaxie des épizooties, les auteurs proposent d'effectuer des contrôles par sondages des volailles importées de pays où la maladie de Newcastle est endémique. Estudios realizados en aves de abasto extranjeras y nacionales respecto al virus de Newcastle teniendo en cuenta el período de supervivencia del virus 517 piezas de aves de abasto de procedencia americana, polaca, húngara, yugoeslava, finlandesa, danesa, holandesa y alemana, que se hallaban en el comercio, se estudiaron en cuanto al virus de la enfermedad de Newcastle, con el resultado de que en una ocasión en gallinas pertenecientes a una remesa holandesa se identificó un virus patógeno para los pollitos. El virus de Newcastle tenía en gallinas de abasto, almacenadas a  20° C., un período de supervivencia de 836 días y más. En cadáveres enterrados de gallinas, el virus aún se pudo aislar de la medula ósea en dos gallinas al cabo de 56 y 121 días, respectivamente.

C.","Inhibition of African swine fever virus in liquid and feed by medium-chain fatty acids and glycerol monolaurate","Background: The ongoing African swine fever virus (ASFv) epidemic has had a major impact on pig production globally and biosecurity efforts to curb ASFv infectivity and transmission are a high priority. It has been recently identified that feed and feed ingredients, along with drinking water, can serve as transmission vehicles and might facilitate transboundary spread of ASFv. Thus, it is important to test the antiviral activity of regulatory compatible, antiviral feed additives that might inhibit ASFv infectivity in feed. One promising group of feed additive candidates includes medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) and monoglyceride derivatives, which are known to disrupt the lipid membrane surrounding certain enveloped viruses and bacteria. Results: The antiviral activities of selected MCFA, namely caprylic, capric, and lauric acids, and a related monoglyceride, glycerol monolaurate (GML), to inhibit ASFv in liquid and feed conditions were investigated and suitable compounds and inclusion rates were identified that might be useful for mitigating ASFv in feed environments. Antiviral assays showed that all tested MCFA and GML inhibit ASFv. GML was more potent than MCFA because it worked at a lower concentration and inhibited ASFv due to direct virucidal activity along with one or more other antiviral mechanisms. Dose-dependent feed experiments further showed that sufficiently high GML doses can significantly reduce ASFv infectivity in feed in a linear manner in periods as short as 30 min, as determined by infectious viral titer measurements. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments revealed that GML treatment also hinders antibody recognition of the membrane-associated ASFv p72 structural protein, which likely relates to protein conformational changes arising from viral membrane disruption. Conclusion: Together, the findings in this study indicate that MCFA and GML inhibit ASFv in liquid conditions and that GML is also able to reduce ASFv infectivity in feed, which may help to curb disease transmission. © 2020, The Author(s).","2020"

GML was more potent than MCFA because it worked at a lower concentration and inhibited ASFv due to direct virucidal activity along with one or more other antiviral mechanisms. Dose-dependent feed experiments further showed that sufficiently high GML doses can significantly reduce ASFv infectivity in feed in a linear manner in periods as short as 30 min, as determined by infectious viral titer measurements. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) experiments revealed that GML treatment also hinders antibody recognition of the membrane-associated ASFv p72 structural protein, which likely relates to protein conformational changes arising from viral membrane disruption. Conclusion: Together, the findings in this study indicate that MCFA and GML inhibit ASFv in liquid conditions and that GML is also able to reduce ASFv infectivity in feed, which may help to curb disease transmission. © 2020, The Author(s).","2020"

Aim: In this study, we evaluated the potential effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) in individual and synergistic forms to prevent and/or reduce ASF virus (ASFV) infection using in vitro feed model. Methods: The cytotoxicity of MCFAs on porcine alveolar macrophages cells was evaluated by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The potential effects of MCFAs, including C8 (caprylic acid), C8-C6-C10 (caprylic acid-caproic acid-capric acid; 1:1:1 ratio) and C8-C10-C12 (caprylic acid-capric acid-lauric acid; 1:1:1 ratio) against a field ASFV strain isolated in the capital Hanoi of Vietnam, were further examined by real-time PCR and haemadsorption assays in in vitro feed model. Results: Our results indicated that all tested products do not induce cytotoxicity at the dose of 100 µg/ml and are suitable for further in vitro examination. These products have shown a strong antiviral effect against ASFV infectivity at doses of 0.375% and 0.5%. Interestingly, the synergistic MCFAs have shown clearly their potential activities against ASFV in which at a lower dose of 0.25%, pre-treatment with product two and three induced significant increases at the level of Cq value when compared to positive control and/or product 1 (p < 0.05). However, the viral titre was not changed after 24 hours post-inoculation when compared to positive control. Our findings suggested that all tested products, both individual and synergistic forms of MCFAs, have possessed a strong anti-ASFV effect, and this effect is dose-dependence in in vitro feed model. Additionally, synergistic effects of MCFAs are more effective against ASFV when compared to individual forms. Conclusion: Together, the findings in this study indicate that MCFAs, both individual and synergistic forms, inhibit against a field ASFV strain in the feed model, which may support minimizing the risk of ASF transmission in the pig population.

Results: Our results indicated that all tested products do not induce cytotoxicity at the dose of 100 µg/ml and are suitable for further in vitro examination. These products have shown a strong antiviral effect against ASFV infectivity at doses of 0.375% and 0.5%. Interestingly, the synergistic MCFAs have shown clearly their potential activities against ASFV in which at a lower dose of 0.25%, pre-treatment with product two and three induced significant increases at the level of Cq value when compared to positive control and/or product 1 (p < 0.05). However, the viral titre was not changed after 24 hours post-inoculation when compared to positive control. Our findings suggested that all tested products, both individual and synergistic forms of MCFAs, have possessed a strong anti-ASFV effect, and this effect is dose-dependence in in vitro feed model. Additionally, synergistic effects of MCFAs are more effective against ASFV when compared to individual forms. Conclusion: Together, the findings in this study indicate that MCFAs, both individual and synergistic forms, inhibit against a field ASFV strain in the feed model, which may support minimizing the risk of ASF transmission in the pig population. Further studies focusing on in vivo anti-ASFV effects of MCFAs are important to bring new insight into the mode of ASFV-reduced action by these compounds in swine feed. © 2021, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

V.","The potential anti-african swine fever virus effects of medium chain fatty acids on in vitro feed model: An evaluation study using epidemic asfv strain circulating in Vietnam","Background: African swine fever (ASF) is an important disease affecting swine and has a significant economic loss in both the developed and developing world. Aim: In this study, we evaluated the potential effects of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) in individual and synergistic forms to prevent and/or reduce ASF virus (ASFV) infection using in vitro feed model. Methods: The cytotoxicity of MCFAs on porcine alveolar macrophages cells was evaluated by using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The potential effects of MCFAs, including C8 (caprylic acid), C8-C6-C10 (caprylic acid-caproic acid-capric acid; 1:1:1 ratio) and C8-C10-C12 (caprylic acid-capric acid-lauric acid; 1:1:1 ratio) against a field ASFV strain isolated in the capital Hanoi of Vietnam, were further examined by real-time PCR and haemadsorption assays in in vitro feed model. Results: Our results indicated that all tested products do not induce cytotoxicity at the dose of 100 µg/ml and are suitable for further in vitro examination. These products have shown a strong antiviral effect against ASFV infectivity at doses of 0.375% and 0.5%. Interestingly, the synergistic MCFAs have shown clearly their potential activities against ASFV in which at a lower dose of 0.25%, pre-treatment with product two and three induced significant increases at the level of Cq value when compared to positive control and/or product 1 (p < 0.05). However, the viral titre was not changed after 24 hours post-inoculation when compared to positive control. Our findings suggested that all tested products, both individual and synergistic forms of MCFAs, have possessed a strong anti-ASFV effect, and this effect is dose-dependence in in vitro feed model. Additionally, synergistic effects of MCFAs are more effective against ASFV when compared to individual forms. Conclusion: Together, the findings in this study indicate that MCFAs, both individual and synergistic forms, inhibit against a field ASFV strain in the feed model, which may support minimizing the risk of ASF transmission in the pig population. Further studies focusing on in vivo anti-ASFV effects of MCFAs are important to bring new insight into the mode of ASFV-reduced action by these compounds in swine feed. © 2021, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tripoli.

While imports of animals and animal-derived products are highly regulated for the purpose of infectious disease prevention, there has been less consideration of the viability of infectious agents in inanimate products, such as feed. This study investigated the ability of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) to remain infectious as a contaminant of commercial whole pig feed and select pig feed ingredients, and to establish the minimum infectious dose (MIDF) required to cause foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in pigs that consumed contaminated feed. FMDV viability in vitro varied depending on virus strain, feed product, and storage temperature, with increased duration of infectivity in soybean meal compared to pelleted whole feed. Specifically, both strains of FMDV evaluated remained viable through to the end of the 37 day observation period in experimentally contaminated soybean meal stored at 4 or 20°C. The MIDF for pigs consuming contaminated feed varied across virus strains and exposure duration in the range of 106.2 to 107 TCID50. The ability of FMDV to cause infection in exposed pigs was mitigated by pre-treatment of feed with two commercially available feed additives, based on either formaldehyde (SalCURB®) or lactic acid (Guardian). Our findings demonstrate that FMDV may remain infectious in pig feed ingredients for durations compatible with transoceanic transport. Although the observed MIDF was relatively high, variations in feeding conditions and biophysical characteristics of different virus strains may alter the probability of infection.

This study investigated the ability of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) to remain infectious as a contaminant of commercial whole pig feed and select pig feed ingredients, and to establish the minimum infectious dose (MIDF) required to cause foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in pigs that consumed contaminated feed. FMDV viability in vitro varied depending on virus strain, feed product, and storage temperature, with increased duration of infectivity in soybean meal compared to pelleted whole feed. Specifically, both strains of FMDV evaluated remained viable through to the end of the 37 day observation period in experimentally contaminated soybean meal stored at 4 or 20°C. The MIDF for pigs consuming contaminated feed varied across virus strains and exposure duration in the range of 106.2 to 107 TCID50. The ability of FMDV to cause infection in exposed pigs was mitigated by pre-treatment of feed with two commercially available feed additives, based on either formaldehyde (SalCURB®) or lactic acid (Guardian). Our findings demonstrate that FMDV may remain infectious in pig feed ingredients for durations compatible with transoceanic transport. Although the observed MIDF was relatively high, variations in feeding conditions and biophysical characteristics of different virus strains may alter the probability of infection. These findings may be used to parameterize modelling of the risk of FMDV incursions and to regulate feed importation to minimize the risk of inadvertent importation. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

In contrast, spiked SDPP stored at room temperature displayed a distinct ASFV titer reduction after 1 week (>2.8 log levels) and complete inactivation after 2 weeks (>5.7 log levels).

FMDV affects many different cloven-hoofed animals, whereas SVDV and CSFV are restricted to domestic and feral pigs together with wild boar. Europe is normally free of these diseases, but occasionally outbreaks happen, which can cause huge economic losses. Handling of these viruses, in particular FMDV and CSFV, is only allowed within high containment laboratories and stables. Periodically such facilities need to be decommissioned for repair or closing down, which is done by cleaning and chemical disinfection, followed by fumigation due to residual risk from virus on surfaces in inaccessible places. However, building materials in older laboratories or stables that have housed infected animals may not be well-suited for fumigation. Heat treatment is another way of inactivating viruses. In this study, we have determined the survival of infectivity in air-dried virus samples on glass and plastic surfaces incubated at room temperature or heated to 70 °C for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days. Each of the tested viruses was inactivated to below the limit of detection after 24 h or 48 h of incubation at 70 °C; in contrast, some of these viruses were still infectious after 7 days of incubation at room temperature.

FMDV affects many different cloven-hoofed animals, whereas SVDV and CSFV are restricted to domestic and feral pigs together with wild boar. Europe is normally free of these diseases, but occasionally outbreaks happen, which can cause huge economic losses. Handling of these viruses, in particular FMDV and CSFV, is only allowed within high containment laboratories and stables. Periodically such facilities need to be decommissioned for repair or closing down, which is done by cleaning and chemical disinfection, followed by fumigation due to residual risk from virus on surfaces in inaccessible places. However, building materials in older laboratories or stables that have housed infected animals may not be well-suited for fumigation. Heat treatment is another way of inactivating viruses. In this study, we have determined the survival of infectivity in air-dried virus samples on glass and plastic surfaces incubated at room temperature or heated to 70 °C for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days.

Europe is normally free of these diseases, but occasionally outbreaks happen, which can cause huge economic losses. Handling of these viruses, in particular FMDV and CSFV, is only allowed within high containment laboratories and stables. Periodically such facilities need to be decommissioned for repair or closing down, which is done by cleaning and chemical disinfection, followed by fumigation due to residual risk from virus on surfaces in inaccessible places. However, building materials in older laboratories or stables that have housed infected animals may not be well-suited for fumigation. Heat treatment is another way of inactivating viruses. In this study, we have determined the survival of infectivity in air-dried virus samples on glass and plastic surfaces incubated at room temperature or heated to 70 °C for 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 days. Each of the tested viruses was inactivated to below the limit of detection after 24 h or 48 h of incubation at 70 °C; in contrast, some of these viruses were still infectious after 7 days of incubation at room temperature. This study provides important information that can be used in relation to decontamination of buildings and in risk-assessments. © 2021 Chinese Medical Association Publishing House","2021"
