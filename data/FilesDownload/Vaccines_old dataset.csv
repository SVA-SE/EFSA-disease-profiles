New serotypes have emerged, however, for which there are no specific commercial vaccines. This study addressed whether heterologous vaccines would help protect against 2 serotypes. Thirty-seven sheep were randomly allocated to 7 groups of 5 or 6 animals. Four groups were vaccinated with commercial vaccines against BTV strains 2, 4, and 9. A fifth positive control group was given a vaccine against BTV-8. The other 2 groups were unvaccinated controls. Sheep were then challenged by subcutaneous injection of either BTV-16 (2 groups) or BTV-8 (5 groups). Taken together, 24/25 sheep from the 4 experimental groups developed detectable antibodies against the vaccinated viruses. Furthermore, sheep that received heterologous vaccines showed significantly reduced viraemia and clinical scores for BTV-16 when compared to unvaccinated controls. Reductions in clinical signs and viraemia among heterologously vaccinated sheep were not as common after challenge with BTV-8. This study shows that heterologous protection can occur, but that it is difficult to predict if partial or complete protection will be achieved following inactivated-BTV vaccination.

Reductions in clinical signs and viraemia among heterologously vaccinated sheep were not as common after challenge with BTV-8. This study shows that heterologous protection can occur, but that it is difficult to predict if partial or complete protection will be achieved following inactivated-BTV vaccination.

Sheep were then challenged by subcutaneous injection of either BTV-16 (2 groups) or BTV-8 (5 groups). Taken together, 24/25 sheep from the 4 experimental groups developed detectable antibodies against the vaccinated viruses. Furthermore, sheep that received heterologous vaccines showed significantly reduced viraemia and clinical scores for BTV-16 when compared to unvaccinated controls. Reductions in clinical signs and viraemia among heterologously vaccinated sheep were not as common after challenge with BTV-8. This study shows that heterologous protection can occur, but that it is difficult to predict if partial or complete protection will be achieved following inactivated-BTV vaccination.

Furthermore, sheep that received heterologous vaccines showed significantly reduced viraemia and clinical scores for BTV-16 when compared to unvaccinated controls. Reductions in clinical signs and viraemia among heterologously vaccinated sheep were not as common after challenge with BTV-8. This study shows that heterologous protection can occur, but that it is difficult to predict if partial or complete protection will be achieved following inactivated-BTV vaccination.

This study was conducted to demonstrate efficacy of an inactivated, lineage 1-based, WNV vaccine (Equip (R) WNV) against intrathecal challenge of horses with a recent isolate of lineage 2 WNV. Twenty horses, sero-negative for WNV, were enrolled and were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: an unvaccinated control group (T01, n = 10) and a group administered with Equip (R) WNV (T02, n = 10). Horses were vaccinated at Day 0 and 21 and were challenged at day 42 with WNV lineage 2, Nea Santa/Greece/2010. Personnel performing clinical observations were blinded to treatment allocation. Sixty percent of the controls had to be euthanized after challenge compared to none of the vaccinates. A significantly lower percentage of the vaccinated animals showed clinical disease (two different clinical observations present on the same day) on six different days of study and the percentage of days with clinical disease was significantly lower in the vaccinated group. A total of 80% of the non-vaccinated horses showed viremia while only one vaccinated animal was positive by virus isolation on a single occasion. Vaccinated animals started to develop antibodies against WNV lineage 2 from day 14 (2 weeks after the first vaccination) and at day 42 (the time of onset of immunity) they had all developed a strong antibody response. Histopathology scores for all unvaccinated animals ranged from mild to very severe in each of the tissues examined (cervical spinal cord, medulla and pons), whereas in vaccinated horses 8 of 10 animals had no lesions and 2 had minimal lesions in one tissue. In conclusion, Equip (R) WNV significantly reduced the number of viremic horses, the duration and severity of clinical signs of disease and mortality following challenge with lineage 2 WNV.

A significantly lower percentage of the vaccinated animals showed clinical disease (two different clinical observations present on the same day) on six different days of study and the percentage of days with clinical disease was significantly lower in the vaccinated group. A total of 80% of the non-vaccinated horses showed viremia while only one vaccinated animal was positive by virus isolation on a single occasion. Vaccinated animals started to develop antibodies against WNV lineage 2 from day 14 (2 weeks after the first vaccination) and at day 42 (the time of onset of immunity) they had all developed a strong antibody response. Histopathology scores for all unvaccinated animals ranged from mild to very severe in each of the tissues examined (cervical spinal cord, medulla and pons), whereas in vaccinated horses 8 of 10 animals had no lesions and 2 had minimal lesions in one tissue. In conclusion, Equip (R) WNV significantly reduced the number of viremic horses, the duration and severity of clinical signs of disease and mortality following challenge with lineage 2 WNV.

A significantly lower percentage of the vaccinated animals showed clinical disease (two different clinical observations present on the same day) on six different days of study and the percentage of days with clinical disease was significantly lower in the vaccinated group. A total of 80% of the non-vaccinated horses showed viremia while only one vaccinated animal was positive by virus isolation on a single occasion. Vaccinated animals started to develop antibodies against WNV lineage 2 from day 14 (2 weeks after the first vaccination) and at day 42 (the time of onset of immunity) they had all developed a strong antibody response. Histopathology scores for all unvaccinated animals ranged from mild to very severe in each of the tissues examined (cervical spinal cord, medulla and pons), whereas in vaccinated horses 8 of 10 animals had no lesions and 2 had minimal lesions in one tissue. In conclusion, Equip (R) WNV significantly reduced the number of viremic horses, the duration and severity of clinical signs of disease and mortality following challenge with lineage 2 WNV.

This study was conducted to demonstrate efficacy of an inactivated, lineage 1-based, WNV vaccine (Equip (R) WNV) against intrathecal challenge of horses with a recent isolate of lineage 2 WNV. Twenty horses, sero-negative for WNV, were enrolled and were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: an unvaccinated control group (T01, n = 10) and a group administered with Equip (R) WNV (T02, n = 10). Horses were vaccinated at Day 0 and 21 and were challenged at day 42 with WNV lineage 2, Nea Santa/Greece/2010. Personnel performing clinical observations were blinded to treatment allocation. Sixty percent of the controls had to be euthanized after challenge compared to none of the vaccinates. A significantly lower percentage of the vaccinated animals showed clinical disease (two different clinical observations present on the same day) on six different days of study and the percentage of days with clinical disease was significantly lower in the vaccinated group. A total of 80% of the non-vaccinated horses showed viremia while only one vaccinated animal was positive by virus isolation on a single occasion. Vaccinated animals started to develop antibodies against WNV lineage 2 from day 14 (2 weeks after the first vaccination) and at day 42 (the time of onset of immunity) they had all developed a strong antibody response. Histopathology scores for all unvaccinated animals ranged from mild to very severe in each of the tissues examined (cervical spinal cord, medulla and pons), whereas in vaccinated horses 8 of 10 animals had no lesions and 2 had minimal lesions in one tissue. In conclusion, Equip (R) WNV significantly reduced the number of viremic horses, the duration and severity of clinical signs of disease and mortality following challenge with lineage 2 WNV.

Ludlow, Corey Cook, Jeremy Salt, Ellen Ons;Protection of horses from West Nile virus Lineage 2 challenge following immunization with a whole, inactivated WNV lineage 1 vaccine;Over the last years West Nile virus (WNV) lineage 2 has spread from the African to the European continent. This study was conducted to demonstrate efficacy of an inactivated, lineage 1-based, WNV vaccine (Equip (R) WNV) against intrathecal challenge of horses with a recent isolate of lineage 2 WNV. Twenty horses, sero-negative for WNV, were enrolled and were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: an unvaccinated control group (T01, n = 10) and a group administered with Equip (R) WNV (T02, n = 10). Horses were vaccinated at Day 0 and 21 and were challenged at day 42 with WNV lineage 2, Nea Santa/Greece/2010. Personnel performing clinical observations were blinded to treatment allocation. Sixty percent of the controls had to be euthanized after challenge compared to none of the vaccinates. A significantly lower percentage of the vaccinated animals showed clinical disease (two different clinical observations present on the same day) on six different days of study and the percentage of days with clinical disease was significantly lower in the vaccinated group. A total of 80% of the non-vaccinated horses showed viremia while only one vaccinated animal was positive by virus isolation on a single occasion. Vaccinated animals started to develop antibodies against WNV lineage 2 from day 14 (2 weeks after the first vaccination) and at day 42 (the time of onset of immunity) they had all developed a strong antibody response. Histopathology scores for all unvaccinated animals ranged from mild to very severe in each of the tissues examined (cervical spinal cord, medulla and pons), whereas in vaccinated horses 8 of 10 animals had no lesions and 2 had minimal lesions in one tissue. In conclusion, Equip (R) WNV significantly reduced the number of viremic horses, the duration and severity of clinical signs of disease and mortality following challenge with lineage 2 WNV.

This study was conducted to demonstrate efficacy of an inactivated, lineage 1-based, WNV vaccine (Equip (R) WNV) against intrathecal challenge of horses with a recent isolate of lineage 2 WNV. Twenty horses, sero-negative for WNV, were enrolled and were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups: an unvaccinated control group (T01, n = 10) and a group administered with Equip (R) WNV (T02, n = 10). Horses were vaccinated at Day 0 and 21 and were challenged at day 42 with WNV lineage 2, Nea Santa/Greece/2010. Personnel performing clinical observations were blinded to treatment allocation. Sixty percent of the controls had to be euthanized after challenge compared to none of the vaccinates. A significantly lower percentage of the vaccinated animals showed clinical disease (two different clinical observations present on the same day) on six different days of study and the percentage of days with clinical disease was significantly lower in the vaccinated group. A total of 80% of the non-vaccinated horses showed viremia while only one vaccinated animal was positive by virus isolation on a single occasion. Vaccinated animals started to develop antibodies against WNV lineage 2 from day 14 (2 weeks after the first vaccination) and at day 42 (the time of onset of immunity) they had all developed a strong antibody response. Histopathology scores for all unvaccinated animals ranged from mild to very severe in each of the tissues examined (cervical spinal cord, medulla and pons), whereas in vaccinated horses 8 of 10 animals had no lesions and 2 had minimal lesions in one tissue.

Histopathology scores for all unvaccinated animals ranged from mild to very severe in each of the tissues examined (cervical spinal cord, medulla and pons), whereas in vaccinated horses 8 of 10 animals had no lesions and 2 had minimal lesions in one tissue. In conclusion, Equip (R) WNV significantly reduced the number of viremic horses, the duration and severity of clinical signs of disease and mortality following challenge with lineage 2 WNV.

Klinkenberg;Scaling from challenge experiments to the field: Quantifying the impact of vaccination on the transmission of bluetongue virus serotype 8;"Bluetongue (BT) is an economically important disease of ruminants caused by bluetongue virus (BTV) and transmitted by Culicoides biting midges. The most practical and effective way to protect susceptible animals against BTV is by vaccination. Data from challenge studies in calves and sheep conducted by Intervet International b.v., in particular, presence of viral RNA in the blood of challenged animals, were used to estimate vaccine efficacy. The results of the challenge studies for calves indicated that vaccination is likely to reduce the basic reproduction number (R-0) for BTV in cattle to below one (i.e. prevent major outbreaks within a holding) and that this reduction is robust to uncertainty in the model parameters. Sensitivity analysis showed that the whether or not vaccination is predicted to reduce R-0 to below one depended on the following assumptions: (i) whether ""doubtful"" results from the challenge studies are treated as negative or positive; (ii) whether or not the probability of transmission from host to vector is reduced by vaccination; and (iii) whether the extrinsic incubation period follows a realistic gamma distribution or the more commonly used exponential distribution. For sheep, all but one of the vaccinated animals were protected and, consequently, vaccination will consistently reduce R-0 in sheep to below one. Using a stochastic spatial model for the spread of BTV in Great Britain (GB), vaccination was predicted to reduce both the incidence of disease and spatial spread in simulated BTV outbreaks in GB, in both reactive vaccination strategies and when an incursion occurred into a previously vaccinated population.

The severity of clinical signs was recorded (using a modified numerical scoring-system, which is described) along with viraemia and serum neutralizing (SN) antibody levels. Low level SN-antibodies were detected at the time of challenge (three weeks after vaccination). All unvaccinated control animals became infected after challenge, developing high SN-antibody titres by 21 days post challenge (dpc). Vaccinees showed faster increases in SN-antibody titres ('booster' response), with significantly higher titres at 6 dpc than unvaccinated controls. Although only limited clinical-signs could be attributed to BTV in younger animals infected with the mammalian-cell-culture derived virus, both BTV-8 challenge preparations induced severe clinical signs comparable to 'bluetongue' observed during natural outbreaks in older unvaccinated animals. Challenge with BTV-8 grown in Culicoides cell-cultures seemed to induce greater severity of clinical-scores and 'post-mortem lesions' than the mammalian-derived BTV-8 strain.

Texel cross-breed and Dorset Poll sheep vaccinated with inactivated BTV-8 vaccine ('Bovilis (R) BTV8' from MSD Animal Health), were challenged with low-passage BTV-8 (Northern European strain) grown in either insect (Culicoides) or mammalian cell-cultures. The severity of clinical signs was recorded (using a modified numerical scoring-system, which is described) along with viraemia and serum neutralizing (SN) antibody levels. Low level SN-antibodies were detected at the time of challenge (three weeks after vaccination). All unvaccinated control animals became infected after challenge, developing high SN-antibody titres by 21 days post challenge (dpc). Vaccinees showed faster increases in SN-antibody titres ('booster' response), with significantly higher titres at 6 dpc than unvaccinated controls. Although only limited clinical-signs could be attributed to BTV in younger animals infected with the mammalian-cell-culture derived virus, both BTV-8 challenge preparations induced severe clinical signs comparable to 'bluetongue' observed during natural outbreaks in older unvaccinated animals. Challenge with BTV-8 grown in Culicoides cell-cultures seemed to induce greater severity of clinical-scores and 'post-mortem lesions' than the mammalian-derived BTV-8 strain. Vaccination reduced clinical signs, fever, and viraemia equally well after challenge with either virus preparation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2012

Identification of BTV challenge-strains that reliably induce viraemia and clinical signs comparable to those in naturally infected animals, is therefore important for vaccine evaluation. Texel cross-breed and Dorset Poll sheep vaccinated with inactivated BTV-8 vaccine ('Bovilis (R) BTV8' from MSD Animal Health), were challenged with low-passage BTV-8 (Northern European strain) grown in either insect (Culicoides) or mammalian cell-cultures. The severity of clinical signs was recorded (using a modified numerical scoring-system, which is described) along with viraemia and serum neutralizing (SN) antibody levels. Low level SN-antibodies were detected at the time of challenge (three weeks after vaccination). All unvaccinated control animals became infected after challenge, developing high SN-antibody titres by 21 days post challenge (dpc). Vaccinees showed faster increases in SN-antibody titres ('booster' response), with significantly higher titres at 6 dpc than unvaccinated controls. Although only limited clinical-signs could be attributed to BTV in younger animals infected with the mammalian-cell-culture derived virus, both BTV-8 challenge preparations induced severe clinical signs comparable to 'bluetongue' observed during natural outbreaks in older unvaccinated animals. Challenge with BTV-8 grown in Culicoides cell-cultures seemed to induce greater severity of clinical-scores and 'post-mortem lesions' than the mammalian-derived BTV-8 strain.

Challenge with BTV-8 grown in Culicoides cell-cultures seemed to induce greater severity of clinical-scores and 'post-mortem lesions' than the mammalian-derived BTV-8 strain. Vaccination reduced clinical signs, fever, and viraemia equally well after challenge with either virus preparation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2012

Identification of BTV challenge-strains that reliably induce viraemia and clinical signs comparable to those in naturally infected animals, is therefore important for vaccine evaluation. Texel cross-breed and Dorset Poll sheep vaccinated with inactivated BTV-8 vaccine ('Bovilis (R) BTV8' from MSD Animal Health), were challenged with low-passage BTV-8 (Northern European strain) grown in either insect (Culicoides) or mammalian cell-cultures. The severity of clinical signs was recorded (using a modified numerical scoring-system, which is described) along with viraemia and serum neutralizing (SN) antibody levels. Low level SN-antibodies were detected at the time of challenge (three weeks after vaccination). All unvaccinated control animals became infected after challenge, developing high SN-antibody titres by 21 days post challenge (dpc). Vaccinees showed faster increases in SN-antibody titres ('booster' response), with significantly higher titres at 6 dpc than unvaccinated controls. Although only limited clinical-signs could be attributed to BTV in younger animals infected with the mammalian-cell-culture derived virus, both BTV-8 challenge preparations induced severe clinical signs comparable to 'bluetongue' observed during natural outbreaks in older unvaccinated animals. Challenge with BTV-8 grown in Culicoides cell-cultures seemed to induce greater severity of clinical-scores and 'post-mortem lesions' than the mammalian-derived BTV-8 strain. Vaccination reduced clinical signs, fever, and viraemia equally well after challenge with either virus preparation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2012

Although only limited clinical-signs could be attributed to BTV in younger animals infected with the mammalian-cell-culture derived virus, both BTV-8 challenge preparations induced severe clinical signs comparable to 'bluetongue' observed during natural outbreaks in older unvaccinated animals. Challenge with BTV-8 grown in Culicoides cell-cultures seemed to induce greater severity of clinical-scores and 'post-mortem lesions' than the mammalian-derived BTV-8 strain. Vaccination reduced clinical signs, fever, and viraemia equally well after challenge with either virus preparation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2012

Identification of BTV challenge-strains that reliably induce viraemia and clinical signs comparable to those in naturally infected animals, is therefore important for vaccine evaluation. Texel cross-breed and Dorset Poll sheep vaccinated with inactivated BTV-8 vaccine ('Bovilis (R) BTV8' from MSD Animal Health), were challenged with low-passage BTV-8 (Northern European strain) grown in either insect (Culicoides) or mammalian cell-cultures. The severity of clinical signs was recorded (using a modified numerical scoring-system, which is described) along with viraemia and serum neutralizing (SN) antibody levels. Low level SN-antibodies were detected at the time of challenge (three weeks after vaccination). All unvaccinated control animals became infected after challenge, developing high SN-antibody titres by 21 days post challenge (dpc). Vaccinees showed faster increases in SN-antibody titres ('booster' response), with significantly higher titres at 6 dpc than unvaccinated controls. Although only limited clinical-signs could be attributed to BTV in younger animals infected with the mammalian-cell-culture derived virus, both BTV-8 challenge preparations induced severe clinical signs comparable to 'bluetongue' observed during natural outbreaks in older unvaccinated animals. Challenge with BTV-8 grown in Culicoides cell-cultures seemed to induce greater severity of clinical-scores and 'post-mortem lesions' than the mammalian-derived BTV-8 strain. Vaccination reduced clinical signs, fever, and viraemia equally well after challenge with either virus preparation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2012

Although only limited clinical-signs could be attributed to BTV in younger animals infected with the mammalian-cell-culture derived virus, both BTV-8 challenge preparations induced severe clinical signs comparable to 'bluetongue' observed during natural outbreaks in older unvaccinated animals. Challenge with BTV-8 grown in Culicoides cell-cultures seemed to induce greater severity of clinical-scores and 'post-mortem lesions' than the mammalian-derived BTV-8 strain. Vaccination reduced clinical signs, fever, and viraemia equally well after challenge with either virus preparation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2012

Serological, virological and clinical examinations were conducted before and after challenge. Three groups of 10 goats each (groups A, B and C) were randomly constituted and 2 groups (A and C) were subcutaneously vaccinated twice with one dose of the two commercial vaccines BTVPUR ALSAP 8 (group A) or BOVILIS BTV8 (group C) respectively. Animals of the groups A, C and B (B: controls) were challenged with a virulent inoculum containing BTV-8. During the experiment, it was found out that the BTV-8 challenge inoculum was contaminated with another BTV serotype. However, results demonstrated that vaccination of goats with two injections of BTVPUR ALSAP 8 or BOVILIS BTV8 provided a significant clinical protection against a BTV-8 challenge and completely prevented BTV-8 viraemia in all vaccinated animals. Qualitative data showed no difference in the kinetics and levels of the humoral response induced by these two inactivated vaccines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011

In this study, the efficacy of two inactivated vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) used in Europe since 2008, BTVPUR ALSAP (R) 8 (MERIAL) and BOVILIS (R) BTV8 (Intervet/SP-AH), was evaluated in goats immunized and challenged with BTV-8 field isolates under experimental conditions. Serological, virological and clinical examinations were conducted before and after challenge. Three groups of 10 goats each (groups A, B and C) were randomly constituted and 2 groups (A and C) were subcutaneously vaccinated twice with one dose of the two commercial vaccines BTVPUR ALSAP 8 (group A) or BOVILIS BTV8 (group C) respectively. Animals of the groups A, C and B (B: controls) were challenged with a virulent inoculum containing BTV-8. During the experiment, it was found out that the BTV-8 challenge inoculum was contaminated with another BTV serotype. However, results demonstrated that vaccination of goats with two injections of BTVPUR ALSAP 8 or BOVILIS BTV8 provided a significant clinical protection against a BTV-8 challenge and completely prevented BTV-8 viraemia in all vaccinated animals. Qualitative data showed no difference in the kinetics and levels of the humoral response induced by these two inactivated vaccines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011

In this study, the efficacy of two inactivated vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) used in Europe since 2008, BTVPUR ALSAP (R) 8 (MERIAL) and BOVILIS (R) BTV8 (Intervet/SP-AH), was evaluated in goats immunized and challenged with BTV-8 field isolates under experimental conditions. Serological, virological and clinical examinations were conducted before and after challenge. Three groups of 10 goats each (groups A, B and C) were randomly constituted and 2 groups (A and C) were subcutaneously vaccinated twice with one dose of the two commercial vaccines BTVPUR ALSAP 8 (group A) or BOVILIS BTV8 (group C) respectively. Animals of the groups A, C and B (B: controls) were challenged with a virulent inoculum containing BTV-8. During the experiment, it was found out that the BTV-8 challenge inoculum was contaminated with another BTV serotype. However, results demonstrated that vaccination of goats with two injections of BTVPUR ALSAP 8 or BOVILIS BTV8 provided a significant clinical protection against a BTV-8 challenge and completely prevented BTV-8 viraemia in all vaccinated animals. Qualitative data showed no difference in the kinetics and levels of the humoral response induced by these two inactivated vaccines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011

In this study, the efficacy of two inactivated vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) used in Europe since 2008, BTVPUR ALSAP (R) 8 (MERIAL) and BOVILIS (R) BTV8 (Intervet/SP-AH), was evaluated in goats immunized and challenged with BTV-8 field isolates under experimental conditions. Serological, virological and clinical examinations were conducted before and after challenge. Three groups of 10 goats each (groups A, B and C) were randomly constituted and 2 groups (A and C) were subcutaneously vaccinated twice with one dose of the two commercial vaccines BTVPUR ALSAP 8 (group A) or BOVILIS BTV8 (group C) respectively. Animals of the groups A, C and B (B: controls) were challenged with a virulent inoculum containing BTV-8. During the experiment, it was found out that the BTV-8 challenge inoculum was contaminated with another BTV serotype. However, results demonstrated that vaccination of goats with two injections of BTVPUR ALSAP 8 or BOVILIS BTV8 provided a significant clinical protection against a BTV-8 challenge and completely prevented BTV-8 viraemia in all vaccinated animals. Qualitative data showed no difference in the kinetics and levels of the humoral response induced by these two inactivated vaccines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011

In this study, the efficacy of two inactivated vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) used in Europe since 2008, BTVPUR ALSAP (R) 8 (MERIAL) and BOVILIS (R) BTV8 (Intervet/SP-AH), was evaluated in goats immunized and challenged with BTV-8 field isolates under experimental conditions. Serological, virological and clinical examinations were conducted before and after challenge. Three groups of 10 goats each (groups A, B and C) were randomly constituted and 2 groups (A and C) were subcutaneously vaccinated twice with one dose of the two commercial vaccines BTVPUR ALSAP 8 (group A) or BOVILIS BTV8 (group C) respectively. Animals of the groups A, C and B (B: controls) were challenged with a virulent inoculum containing BTV-8. During the experiment, it was found out that the BTV-8 challenge inoculum was contaminated with another BTV serotype. However, results demonstrated that vaccination of goats with two injections of BTVPUR ALSAP 8 or BOVILIS BTV8 provided a significant clinical protection against a BTV-8 challenge and completely prevented BTV-8 viraemia in all vaccinated animals. Qualitative data showed no difference in the kinetics and levels of the humoral response induced by these two inactivated vaccines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011

In this study, the efficacy of two inactivated vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) used in Europe since 2008, BTVPUR ALSAP (R) 8 (MERIAL) and BOVILIS (R) BTV8 (Intervet/SP-AH), was evaluated in goats immunized and challenged with BTV-8 field isolates under experimental conditions. Serological, virological and clinical examinations were conducted before and after challenge. Three groups of 10 goats each (groups A, B and C) were randomly constituted and 2 groups (A and C) were subcutaneously vaccinated twice with one dose of the two commercial vaccines BTVPUR ALSAP 8 (group A) or BOVILIS BTV8 (group C) respectively. Animals of the groups A, C and B (B: controls) were challenged with a virulent inoculum containing BTV-8. During the experiment, it was found out that the BTV-8 challenge inoculum was contaminated with another BTV serotype. However, results demonstrated that vaccination of goats with two injections of BTVPUR ALSAP 8 or BOVILIS BTV8 provided a significant clinical protection against a BTV-8 challenge and completely prevented BTV-8 viraemia in all vaccinated animals. Qualitative data showed no difference in the kinetics and levels of the humoral response induced by these two inactivated vaccines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011

In this study, the efficacy of two inactivated vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) used in Europe since 2008, BTVPUR ALSAP (R) 8 (MERIAL) and BOVILIS (R) BTV8 (Intervet/SP-AH), was evaluated in goats immunized and challenged with BTV-8 field isolates under experimental conditions. Serological, virological and clinical examinations were conducted before and after challenge. Three groups of 10 goats each (groups A, B and C) were randomly constituted and 2 groups (A and C) were subcutaneously vaccinated twice with one dose of the two commercial vaccines BTVPUR ALSAP 8 (group A) or BOVILIS BTV8 (group C) respectively. Animals of the groups A, C and B (B: controls) were challenged with a virulent inoculum containing BTV-8. During the experiment, it was found out that the BTV-8 challenge inoculum was contaminated with another BTV serotype. However, results demonstrated that vaccination of goats with two injections of BTVPUR ALSAP 8 or BOVILIS BTV8 provided a significant clinical protection against a BTV-8 challenge and completely prevented BTV-8 viraemia in all vaccinated animals. Qualitative data showed no difference in the kinetics and levels of the humoral response induced by these two inactivated vaccines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011

In this study, the efficacy of two inactivated vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) used in Europe since 2008, BTVPUR ALSAP (R) 8 (MERIAL) and BOVILIS (R) BTV8 (Intervet/SP-AH), was evaluated in goats immunized and challenged with BTV-8 field isolates under experimental conditions. Serological, virological and clinical examinations were conducted before and after challenge. Three groups of 10 goats each (groups A, B and C) were randomly constituted and 2 groups (A and C) were subcutaneously vaccinated twice with one dose of the two commercial vaccines BTVPUR ALSAP 8 (group A) or BOVILIS BTV8 (group C) respectively. Animals of the groups A, C and B (B: controls) were challenged with a virulent inoculum containing BTV-8. During the experiment, it was found out that the BTV-8 challenge inoculum was contaminated with another BTV serotype. However, results demonstrated that vaccination of goats with two injections of BTVPUR ALSAP 8 or BOVILIS BTV8 provided a significant clinical protection against a BTV-8 challenge and completely prevented BTV-8 viraemia in all vaccinated animals. Qualitative data showed no difference in the kinetics and levels of the humoral response induced by these two inactivated vaccines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011

In this study, the efficacy of two inactivated vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) used in Europe since 2008, BTVPUR ALSAP (R) 8 (MERIAL) and BOVILIS (R) BTV8 (Intervet/SP-AH), was evaluated in goats immunized and challenged with BTV-8 field isolates under experimental conditions. Serological, virological and clinical examinations were conducted before and after challenge. Three groups of 10 goats each (groups A, B and C) were randomly constituted and 2 groups (A and C) were subcutaneously vaccinated twice with one dose of the two commercial vaccines BTVPUR ALSAP 8 (group A) or BOVILIS BTV8 (group C) respectively. Animals of the groups A, C and B (B: controls) were challenged with a virulent inoculum containing BTV-8. During the experiment, it was found out that the BTV-8 challenge inoculum was contaminated with another BTV serotype. However, results demonstrated that vaccination of goats with two injections of BTVPUR ALSAP 8 or BOVILIS BTV8 provided a significant clinical protection against a BTV-8 challenge and completely prevented BTV-8 viraemia in all vaccinated animals. Qualitative data showed no difference in the kinetics and levels of the humoral response induced by these two inactivated vaccines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011

Zientara;Evaluation of humoral response and protective efficacy of two inactivated vaccines against bluetongue virus after vaccination of goats;Bluetongue serotype 8 has become a major animal health issue in the European Union and the European member States have agreed on a vaccination strategy, which involves only inactivated vaccines. In this study, the efficacy of two inactivated vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) used in Europe since 2008, BTVPUR ALSAP (R) 8 (MERIAL) and BOVILIS (R) BTV8 (Intervet/SP-AH), was evaluated in goats immunized and challenged with BTV-8 field isolates under experimental conditions. Serological, virological and clinical examinations were conducted before and after challenge. Three groups of 10 goats each (groups A, B and C) were randomly constituted and 2 groups (A and C) were subcutaneously vaccinated twice with one dose of the two commercial vaccines BTVPUR ALSAP 8 (group A) or BOVILIS BTV8 (group C) respectively. Animals of the groups A, C and B (B: controls) were challenged with a virulent inoculum containing BTV-8. During the experiment, it was found out that the BTV-8 challenge inoculum was contaminated with another BTV serotype. However, results demonstrated that vaccination of goats with two injections of BTVPUR ALSAP 8 or BOVILIS BTV8 provided a significant clinical protection against a BTV-8 challenge and completely prevented BTV-8 viraemia in all vaccinated animals. Qualitative data showed no difference in the kinetics and levels of the humoral response induced by these two inactivated vaccines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2011

Ten pregnant ewes (Experiment 1) or heifers (Experiment 2) were vaccinated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three weeks after the completion of the vaccination schedule, all vaccinated animals were infected with BTV-8 together with ten non-vaccinated pregnant animals that served as challenged controls. Four additional pregnant animals received a mock challenge at the same time point. Three weeks after the challenge, the foetuses were collected. In the sheep experiment, the lambs of the vaccinated ewes and the mock infected ewes were negative in the virus isolation, whereas BTV-8 could be isolated from 11/23 lambs of 6/10 ewes in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The incidence and severity of BTV associated lesions, such as haemorrhages, meningitis/encephalitis and necrosis in the placentomes was significantly higher in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The rate of transplacental transmission was less in the cattle experiment: BTV-8 could be detected in 2/10 calves in the BTV-8 challenged control group. All other calves were negative.Vaccination clearly reduced transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in the sheep experiment, whereas in the cattle experiment, the incidence of transmission was too low to demonstrate a significant reduction of transmission by vaccination. However, the vaccine very effectively blocked viraemia, which suggests that the vaccine might prevent transmission in cattle as well.Transplacental transmission of BTV has serious economical consequences, due to the loss of progeny to the livestock industry. Vaccination can be an important aid in the reduction of these economic losses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.;2012

Moormann, A.J. de Smit;Effect of vaccination with an inactivated vaccine on transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in mid term pregnant ewes and heifers;The effect of vaccination with a commercial inactivated Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) vaccine on the ability of BTV-8 to cross the ruminant placenta was investigated in two experiments. Ten pregnant ewes (Experiment 1) or heifers (Experiment 2) were vaccinated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three weeks after the completion of the vaccination schedule, all vaccinated animals were infected with BTV-8 together with ten non-vaccinated pregnant animals that served as challenged controls. Four additional pregnant animals received a mock challenge at the same time point. Three weeks after the challenge, the foetuses were collected. In the sheep experiment, the lambs of the vaccinated ewes and the mock infected ewes were negative in the virus isolation, whereas BTV-8 could be isolated from 11/23 lambs of 6/10 ewes in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The incidence and severity of BTV associated lesions, such as haemorrhages, meningitis/encephalitis and necrosis in the placentomes was significantly higher in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The rate of transplacental transmission was less in the cattle experiment: BTV-8 could be detected in 2/10 calves in the BTV-8 challenged control group. All other calves were negative.Vaccination clearly reduced transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in the sheep experiment, whereas in the cattle experiment, the incidence of transmission was too low to demonstrate a significant reduction of transmission by vaccination. However, the vaccine very effectively blocked viraemia, which suggests that the vaccine might prevent transmission in cattle as well.Transplacental transmission of BTV has serious economical consequences, due to the loss of progeny to the livestock industry.

Moormann, A.J. de Smit;Effect of vaccination with an inactivated vaccine on transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in mid term pregnant ewes and heifers;The effect of vaccination with a commercial inactivated Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) vaccine on the ability of BTV-8 to cross the ruminant placenta was investigated in two experiments. Ten pregnant ewes (Experiment 1) or heifers (Experiment 2) were vaccinated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three weeks after the completion of the vaccination schedule, all vaccinated animals were infected with BTV-8 together with ten non-vaccinated pregnant animals that served as challenged controls. Four additional pregnant animals received a mock challenge at the same time point. Three weeks after the challenge, the foetuses were collected. In the sheep experiment, the lambs of the vaccinated ewes and the mock infected ewes were negative in the virus isolation, whereas BTV-8 could be isolated from 11/23 lambs of 6/10 ewes in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The incidence and severity of BTV associated lesions, such as haemorrhages, meningitis/encephalitis and necrosis in the placentomes was significantly higher in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The rate of transplacental transmission was less in the cattle experiment: BTV-8 could be detected in 2/10 calves in the BTV-8 challenged control group. All other calves were negative.Vaccination clearly reduced transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in the sheep experiment, whereas in the cattle experiment, the incidence of transmission was too low to demonstrate a significant reduction of transmission by vaccination. However, the vaccine very effectively blocked viraemia, which suggests that the vaccine might prevent transmission in cattle as well.Transplacental transmission of BTV has serious economical consequences, due to the loss of progeny to the livestock industry.

Moormann, A.J. de Smit;Effect of vaccination with an inactivated vaccine on transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in mid term pregnant ewes and heifers;The effect of vaccination with a commercial inactivated Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) vaccine on the ability of BTV-8 to cross the ruminant placenta was investigated in two experiments. Ten pregnant ewes (Experiment 1) or heifers (Experiment 2) were vaccinated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three weeks after the completion of the vaccination schedule, all vaccinated animals were infected with BTV-8 together with ten non-vaccinated pregnant animals that served as challenged controls. Four additional pregnant animals received a mock challenge at the same time point. Three weeks after the challenge, the foetuses were collected. In the sheep experiment, the lambs of the vaccinated ewes and the mock infected ewes were negative in the virus isolation, whereas BTV-8 could be isolated from 11/23 lambs of 6/10 ewes in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The incidence and severity of BTV associated lesions, such as haemorrhages, meningitis/encephalitis and necrosis in the placentomes was significantly higher in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The rate of transplacental transmission was less in the cattle experiment: BTV-8 could be detected in 2/10 calves in the BTV-8 challenged control group. All other calves were negative.Vaccination clearly reduced transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in the sheep experiment, whereas in the cattle experiment, the incidence of transmission was too low to demonstrate a significant reduction of transmission by vaccination. However, the vaccine very effectively blocked viraemia, which suggests that the vaccine might prevent transmission in cattle as well.Transplacental transmission of BTV has serious economical consequences, due to the loss of progeny to the livestock industry.

Moormann, A.J. de Smit;Effect of vaccination with an inactivated vaccine on transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in mid term pregnant ewes and heifers;The effect of vaccination with a commercial inactivated Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) vaccine on the ability of BTV-8 to cross the ruminant placenta was investigated in two experiments. Ten pregnant ewes (Experiment 1) or heifers (Experiment 2) were vaccinated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three weeks after the completion of the vaccination schedule, all vaccinated animals were infected with BTV-8 together with ten non-vaccinated pregnant animals that served as challenged controls. Four additional pregnant animals received a mock challenge at the same time point. Three weeks after the challenge, the foetuses were collected. In the sheep experiment, the lambs of the vaccinated ewes and the mock infected ewes were negative in the virus isolation, whereas BTV-8 could be isolated from 11/23 lambs of 6/10 ewes in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The incidence and severity of BTV associated lesions, such as haemorrhages, meningitis/encephalitis and necrosis in the placentomes was significantly higher in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The rate of transplacental transmission was less in the cattle experiment: BTV-8 could be detected in 2/10 calves in the BTV-8 challenged control group. All other calves were negative.Vaccination clearly reduced transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in the sheep experiment, whereas in the cattle experiment, the incidence of transmission was too low to demonstrate a significant reduction of transmission by vaccination. However, the vaccine very effectively blocked viraemia, which suggests that the vaccine might prevent transmission in cattle as well.Transplacental transmission of BTV has serious economical consequences, due to the loss of progeny to the livestock industry.

Moormann, A.J. de Smit;Effect of vaccination with an inactivated vaccine on transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in mid term pregnant ewes and heifers;The effect of vaccination with a commercial inactivated Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) vaccine on the ability of BTV-8 to cross the ruminant placenta was investigated in two experiments. Ten pregnant ewes (Experiment 1) or heifers (Experiment 2) were vaccinated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three weeks after the completion of the vaccination schedule, all vaccinated animals were infected with BTV-8 together with ten non-vaccinated pregnant animals that served as challenged controls. Four additional pregnant animals received a mock challenge at the same time point. Three weeks after the challenge, the foetuses were collected. In the sheep experiment, the lambs of the vaccinated ewes and the mock infected ewes were negative in the virus isolation, whereas BTV-8 could be isolated from 11/23 lambs of 6/10 ewes in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The incidence and severity of BTV associated lesions, such as haemorrhages, meningitis/encephalitis and necrosis in the placentomes was significantly higher in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The rate of transplacental transmission was less in the cattle experiment: BTV-8 could be detected in 2/10 calves in the BTV-8 challenged control group. All other calves were negative.Vaccination clearly reduced transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in the sheep experiment, whereas in the cattle experiment, the incidence of transmission was too low to demonstrate a significant reduction of transmission by vaccination. However, the vaccine very effectively blocked viraemia, which suggests that the vaccine might prevent transmission in cattle as well.Transplacental transmission of BTV has serious economical consequences, due to the loss of progeny to the livestock industry.

Moormann, A.J. de Smit;Effect of vaccination with an inactivated vaccine on transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in mid term pregnant ewes and heifers;The effect of vaccination with a commercial inactivated Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) vaccine on the ability of BTV-8 to cross the ruminant placenta was investigated in two experiments. Ten pregnant ewes (Experiment 1) or heifers (Experiment 2) were vaccinated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three weeks after the completion of the vaccination schedule, all vaccinated animals were infected with BTV-8 together with ten non-vaccinated pregnant animals that served as challenged controls. Four additional pregnant animals received a mock challenge at the same time point. Three weeks after the challenge, the foetuses were collected. In the sheep experiment, the lambs of the vaccinated ewes and the mock infected ewes were negative in the virus isolation, whereas BTV-8 could be isolated from 11/23 lambs of 6/10 ewes in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The incidence and severity of BTV associated lesions, such as haemorrhages, meningitis/encephalitis and necrosis in the placentomes was significantly higher in the BTV-8 challenged control group. The rate of transplacental transmission was less in the cattle experiment: BTV-8 could be detected in 2/10 calves in the BTV-8 challenged control group. All other calves were negative.Vaccination clearly reduced transplacental transmission of BTV-8 in the sheep experiment, whereas in the cattle experiment, the incidence of transmission was too low to demonstrate a significant reduction of transmission by vaccination. However, the vaccine very effectively blocked viraemia, which suggests that the vaccine might prevent transmission in cattle as well.Transplacental transmission of BTV has serious economical consequences, due to the loss of progeny to the livestock industry. Vaccination can be an important aid in the reduction of these economic losses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.;2012

Seroprevalences 1 year after vaccination ranged from 75% to 100%. In two infection experiments, groups of vaccinated sheep and cattle selected either randomly or for low antibody levels were challenged with a European BTV-8 strain 12 months after vaccination. With two exceptions, all animals, including those with low antibody levels prior to challenge, were protected from viral replication and clinical disease even at low initial antibody levels. Vaccination of susceptible ruminants in yearly intervals is thus considered an adequate scheme for BTV-8 control in Europe. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010

In two infection experiments, groups of vaccinated sheep and cattle selected either randomly or for low antibody levels were challenged with a European BTV-8 strain 12 months after vaccination. With two exceptions, all animals, including those with low antibody levels prior to challenge, were protected from viral replication and clinical disease even at low initial antibody levels. Vaccination of susceptible ruminants in yearly intervals is thus considered an adequate scheme for BTV-8 control in Europe. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010

Seroprevalences 1 year after vaccination ranged from 75% to 100%. In two infection experiments, groups of vaccinated sheep and cattle selected either randomly or for low antibody levels were challenged with a European BTV-8 strain 12 months after vaccination. With two exceptions, all animals, including those with low antibody levels prior to challenge, were protected from viral replication and clinical disease even at low initial antibody levels. Vaccination of susceptible ruminants in yearly intervals is thus considered an adequate scheme for BTV-8 control in Europe. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2010

We evaluated vaccinal responses in sheep and the ability of the vaccine to protect against experimental challenge. Sheep vaccinated 10 months previously under field conditions were challenged with BTV-8. One of 7 vaccinated sheep became infected, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR and by virus isolation. The remaining 6 sheep appeared fully protected from virus replication. None of the vaccinated sheep showed clinical signs of BTV and there was a good correlation between the presence of neutralising antibodies on challenge and protection.

In 2008 the European Union instigated a mass-vaccination programme in affected countries using whole virus inactivated vaccines. We evaluated vaccinal responses in sheep and the ability of the vaccine to protect against experimental challenge. Sheep vaccinated 10 months previously under field conditions were challenged with BTV-8. One of 7 vaccinated sheep became infected, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR and by virus isolation. The remaining 6 sheep appeared fully protected from virus replication. None of the vaccinated sheep showed clinical signs of BTV and there was a good correlation between the presence of neutralising antibodies on challenge and protection. Commercially available ELISAs were evaluated for their ability to detect antibodies in sheep vaccinated on a single occasion. The sandwich (double antigen) ELISA assays were found to be more sensitive at detecting antibodies in vaccinated sheep than the competitive ELISAs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2009

In 2008 the European Union instigated a mass-vaccination programme in affected countries using whole virus inactivated vaccines. We evaluated vaccinal responses in sheep and the ability of the vaccine to protect against experimental challenge. Sheep vaccinated 10 months previously under field conditions were challenged with BTV-8. One of 7 vaccinated sheep became infected, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR and by virus isolation. The remaining 6 sheep appeared fully protected from virus replication. None of the vaccinated sheep showed clinical signs of BTV and there was a good correlation between the presence of neutralising antibodies on challenge and protection. Commercially available ELISAs were evaluated for their ability to detect antibodies in sheep vaccinated on a single occasion. The sandwich (double antigen) ELISA assays were found to be more sensitive at detecting antibodies in vaccinated sheep than the competitive ELISAs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2009

One of 7 vaccinated sheep became infected, as evidenced by detection of viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR and by virus isolation. The remaining 6 sheep appeared fully protected from virus replication. None of the vaccinated sheep showed clinical signs of BTV and there was a good correlation between the presence of neutralising antibodies on challenge and protection. Commercially available ELISAs were evaluated for their ability to detect antibodies in sheep vaccinated on a single occasion. The sandwich (double antigen) ELISA assays were found to be more sensitive at detecting antibodies in vaccinated sheep than the competitive ELISAs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;2009

Beer;Efficacy of three inactivated vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 in sheep;Bluetongue has become a major animal health issue in the European Union. The member states and Switzerland have agreed on a vaccination strategy. Three different inactivated monovalent vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 were selected for the compulsory vaccination program carried out in Germany in 2008. The efficacy of these vaccines was evaluated in a pilot study in sheep immunised under field conditions by clinical, virological and serological examination before and after experimental challenge infection with a BTV-8 field isolate. Antibody levels prior to challenge infection differed between the vaccinated groups, but all seroconverted animals were fully protected against clinical disease and virus replication. Only one vaccinated animal was very weakly positive in the real-time RT-PCR at day 10 after challenge infection, and one seronegative sheep in one of the vaccine groups was not protected. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The member states and Switzerland have agreed on a vaccination strategy. Three different inactivated monovalent vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 were selected for the compulsory vaccination program carried out in Germany in 2008. The efficacy of these vaccines was evaluated in a pilot study in sheep immunised under field conditions by clinical, virological and serological examination before and after experimental challenge infection with a BTV-8 field isolate. Antibody levels prior to challenge infection differed between the vaccinated groups, but all seroconverted animals were fully protected against clinical disease and virus replication. Only one vaccinated animal was very weakly positive in the real-time RT-PCR at day 10 after challenge infection, and one seronegative sheep in one of the vaccine groups was not protected. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The member states and Switzerland have agreed on a vaccination strategy. Three different inactivated monovalent vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 were selected for the compulsory vaccination program carried out in Germany in 2008. The efficacy of these vaccines was evaluated in a pilot study in sheep immunised under field conditions by clinical, virological and serological examination before and after experimental challenge infection with a BTV-8 field isolate. Antibody levels prior to challenge infection differed between the vaccinated groups, but all seroconverted animals were fully protected against clinical disease and virus replication. Only one vaccinated animal was very weakly positive in the real-time RT-PCR at day 10 after challenge infection, and one seronegative sheep in one of the vaccine groups was not protected. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The member states and Switzerland have agreed on a vaccination strategy. Three different inactivated monovalent vaccines against bluetongue virus serotype 8 were selected for the compulsory vaccination program carried out in Germany in 2008. The efficacy of these vaccines was evaluated in a pilot study in sheep immunised under field conditions by clinical, virological and serological examination before and after experimental challenge infection with a BTV-8 field isolate. Antibody levels prior to challenge infection differed between the vaccinated groups, but all seroconverted animals were fully protected against clinical disease and virus replication.
