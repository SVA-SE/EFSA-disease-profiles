RVFv is known to circulate widely throughout East Africa; serologic evidence of exposure has also been found in some northern African countries, including Mauritania. This study aimed to ascertain whether RVFv is circulating in regions beyond its known geographic range. Samples from febrile patients (n=181) and nonfebrile healthy agricultural and slaughterhouse workers (n=38) were collected during the summer of 2014 and surveyed for exposure to RVFv by both serologic tests and PCR. Of the 219 samples tested, 7.8% of nonfebrile participants showed immunoglobulin G reactivity to RVFv nucleoprotein and 8.3% of febrile patients showed immunoglobulin M reactivity, with the latter samples indicating recent exposure to the virus. Our results suggest an active circulation of RVFv and evidence of human exposure in the population of Tunisia.";MEDLINE:26740887;;;;;;;;2016-Jan;;;10.1016/j.nmni.2015.10.010;;;;;;;;;;;;New microbes and new infections;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;07-Jan;;;Journal Article;;;;Serologic evidence of exposure to Rift Valley fever virus detected in Tunisia;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://MEDLINE:26740887;9;2016;andrey.gogin;3;Rift Valley fever virus

Richt;Seroepidemiological Study of Interepidemic Rift Valley Fever Virus Infection among Persons with Intense Ruminant Exposure in Madagascar and Kenya;In this cross-sectional seroepidemiological study we sought to examine the evidence for circulation of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) among herders in Madagascar and Kenya. From July 2010 to June 2012, we enrolled 459 herders and 98 controls (without ruminant exposures) and studied their sera (immunoglobulin G [IgG] and IgM through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA] and plaque reduction neutralization test [PRNT] assays) for evidence of previous RVFV infection. Overall, 59 (12.9%) of 459 herders and 7 (7.1%) of the 98 controls were positive by the IgG ELISA assay. Of the 59 ELISA-positive herders, 23 (38.9%) were confirmed by the PRNT assay (21 from eastern Kenya). Two of the 21 PRNT-positive study subjects also had elevated IgM antibodies against RVFV suggesting recent infection. Multivariate modeling in this study revealed that being seminomadic (odds ratio [OR] = 6.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1-15.4) was most strongly associated with antibodies against RVFV. Although we cannot know when these infections occurred, it seems likely that some interepidemic RVFV infections are occurring among herders. As there are disincentives regarding reporting RVFV outbreaks in livestock or wildlife, it may be prudent to conduct periodic, limited, active seroepidemiological surveillance for RVFV infections in herders, especially in eastern Kenya.;WOS:000366540800040;;;;;;;;Dec;;;10.4269/ajtmh.15-0383;;;;;;;;;;0002-9637;6;American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;1364-1370;;;Journal Article;;;;Seroepidemiological Study of Interepidemic Rift Valley Fever Virus Infection among Persons with Intense Ruminant Exposure in Madagascar and Kenya;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000366540800040;93;2015;andrey.gogin;3;Rift Valley fever virus

In a cross-sectional design, during the peak of the epidemic at its epicenter, we found four (0.6%) of 703 healthcare workers (HCWs) IgM seropositive but all with only community-associated exposures. Standard precautions are sufficient for HCWs exposed to known RVF patients, in contrast to other viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) such as Ebola virus disease (EVD) in which the route of transmission differs.

Boshra, T. Thang, S. Babiuk and M. G. Hemida;Seroprevalence of Sheep and Goat Pox, Peste Des Petits Ruminants and Rift Valley Fever in Saudi Arabia;Sheep and goat pox, peste des petits ruminants and Rift Valley fever are important diseases of small ruminant livestock. Sheep and goat pox, along with peste des petits ruminants, are endemic throughout most of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Whereas Rift Valley fever is endemic in Africa, outbreaks in the Middle East have been reported over the past decade, including the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia is a major importer of livestock, and understanding the prevalence of these viral infections would be useful for disease control. In this study, sera from sheep and goats were collected from 3 regions in Saudi Arabia. They were evaluated for antibodies specific to sheep and goat pox, peste des petits ruminants and Rift Valley fever by virus neutralization assays. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the seroprevalence of these viruses in sheep and goats.;WOS:000362962300081;;;;;;;;13-Oct;;;10.1371/journal.pone.0140328;;;;;;;;;;1932-6203;10;Plos One;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;;;;Journal Article;;;;Seroprevalence of Sheep and Goat Pox, Peste Des Petits Ruminants and Rift Valley Fever in Saudi Arabia;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000362962300081;10;2015;andrey.gogin;3;Rift Valley fever virus

Yeh, Y.-S. Cho, J.-S. Choi, J.-Y. Lee, I.-S. Cho and H.-S. Yoo;Serological surveillance studies confirm the Rift Valley fever virus free status in South Korea;Rift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants. This disease causes abortions in pregnant animals, and it has a high mortality rate in newborn animals. Recently, a Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula increased its potential spread to new regions worldwide. In non-endemic or disease-free countries, early detection and surveillance are important for preventing the introduction of RVFV. In this study, a serological surveillance was conducted to detect antibodies against RVFV. A total of 2382 serum samples from goats and cattle were randomly collected from nine areas in South Korea from 2011 to 2013. These samples were tested for antibodies against RVFV, using commercial ELISA kits. None of the goats and cattle were positive for antibodies against RVFV. This finding suggests that this disease is not present in South Korea, and furthermore presents the evidence of the RVFV-free status of this country.;WOS:000361062500028;;;;;;;;Oct;;;10.1007/s11250-015-0858-8;;;;;;;;;;0049-4747;7;Tropical Animal Health and Production;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;1427-1430;;;Journal Article;;;;Serological surveillance studies confirm the Rift Valley fever virus free status in South Korea;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000361062500028;47;2015;andrey.gogin;3;Rift Valley fever virus

Fields;Seroprevalence of Infections with Dengue, Rift Valley Fever and Chikungunya Viruses in Kenya, 2007;Arthropod-borne viruses are a major constituent of emerging infectious diseases worldwide, but limited data are available on the prevalence, distribution, and risk factors for transmission in Kenya and East Africa. In this study, we used 1,091 HIV-negative blood specimens from the 2007 Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey (KAIS 2007) to test for the presence of IgG antibodies to dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The KAIS 2007 was a national population-based survey conducted by the Government of Kenya to provide comprehensive information needed to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Antibody testing for arboviruses was performed on stored blood specimens from KAIS 2007 through a two-step sandwich IgG ELISA using either commercially available kits or CDC-developed assays. Out of the 1,091 samples tested, 210 (19.2%) were positive for IgG antibodies against at least one of the three arboviruses. DENV was the most common of the three viruses tested (12.5% positive), followed by RVFV and CHIKV (4.5% and 0.97%, respectively). For DENV and RVFV, the participant's province of residence was significantly associated (P <=.01) with seropositivity. Seroprevalence of DENV and RVFV increased with age, while there was no correlation between province of residence/age and seropositivity for CHIKV. Females had twelve times higher odds of exposure to CHIK as opposed to DENV and RVFV where both males and females had the same odds of exposure. Lack of education was significantly associated with a higher odds of previous infection with either DENV or RVFV (p < 0.01). These data show that a number of people are at risk of arbovirus infections depending on their geographic location in Kenya and transmission of these pathogens is greater than previously appreciated. This poses a public health risk, especially for DENV.;WOS:000358197600137;;;;;;;;15-Jul;;;10.1371/journal.pone.0132645;;;;;;;;;;1932-6203;7;Plos One;;;"Times Cited: 1; 0

Soufiane;Survey of investigation around cases of Rift Valley Fever at Tagant, Mauritania;BACKGROUND: Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a zoonotic arbovirosis. Among animals, it mainly affects ruminants, causing abortions in gravid females and deaths among young animals. In humans, RVF virus infection is usually asymptomatic or characterized by a moderate fever. However, in 1-3% of cases, the disease progresses to a severe form with 50% mortality. OBJECTIVE: Search for risk factors and to propose appropriate measures to prevent the potential for extension of the epidemic, and to make recommendations for disease monitoring and control. METHODS: This investigation involved human RVF cases reported between October12 and November20, 2012 in the area of Tagant in Mauritania. Arbovirosis diagnosis was established by the laboratory of the National Institute of Public Health Research in Nouakchott (Mauritania) in collaboration with the Pasteur Institute of Dakar (Senegal). RESULTS: Of 212subjects, RVF serology was positive in 26 (12%). Among those seropositive for RVF, 11 (42%) had severe hemorrhagic forms. The case fatality rate was 91%. A series of animal abortions (cattle, sheep and goats) was observed in the area where all but two subjects resided. Exposure to potential risk factors for RVF virus infection was found in all patients. CONCLUSION: Mortality is very high in the hemorrhagic forms of RVF. Disease prevention is necessary by strengthening the fight against vectors, avoiding contact and consumption of organic products from diseased animals and vaccination of animals in areas where the disease is endemic. Furthermore, it is essential to establish management procedures for patients infected with the RVF virus. An appropriately equipped referral hospital is necessary, together with strengthened epidemiological surveillance by notifying all suspected cases of hemorrhagic fevers.;MEDLINE:25959009;;;;;;;;2015-Jun;;;10.1016/j.respe.2015.03.124;;;;;;;;;;0398-7620;3;Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;213-6;;;Journal Article;;;;Survey of investigation around cases of Rift Valley Fever at Tagant, Mauritania;;;Enquete d'investigation sur des cas de fievre de la vallee du Rift au Tagant, Mauritanie.;;;;<Go to ISI>://MEDLINE:25959009;63;2015;andrey.gogin;3;Rift Valley fever virus

Heraud;Detection in and circulation of Bluetongue virus among domestic ruminants in Madagascar;So far, no published data was available concerning the circulation of Bluetongue virus (BTV) in Madagascar. During a survey on Rift Valley Fever, we were able to detect a virus belonging to BTV. Therefore, we conducted a study aiming at characterizing molecularly the BTV isolated and assess the importance of circulation of BTV in Madagascar. A total of 4393 sera from ruminants selected randomly by stratification and sampled in 30 districts of Madagascar were tested for BTV. Moreover, 175 cattle were followed during 11 months. Phylogenetic analyses were performed from virus isolated from unfed pools of mosquitoes. Overall, the estimated mean seroprevalence of infection at the national level was 95.9% (95% CI: [95.2-96.5]) in cattle and 83.7% (95% CI: [81.4-85.9]) in small ruminants. Estimation of incidence rate was 54 per 100 cattle-years assuming that the incidence rate is constant all year along. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that BTV detected belong to serotype 2. In conclusion, our results showed that BTV is endemic in Madagascar and highly prevalent among cattle. In our study we did not work on the vector involved in transmission of BTV in cattle. Thus, research should be conducted to better describe epidemiology of BTV in Madagascar including vectors and assess economic impact of the disease associated to BTV infections.

Heraud;Detection in and circulation of Bluetongue virus among domestic ruminants in Madagascar;So far, no published data was available concerning the circulation of Bluetongue virus (BTV) in Madagascar. During a survey on Rift Valley Fever, we were able to detect a virus belonging to BTV. Therefore, we conducted a study aiming at characterizing molecularly the BTV isolated and assess the importance of circulation of BTV in Madagascar. A total of 4393 sera from ruminants selected randomly by stratification and sampled in 30 districts of Madagascar were tested for BTV. Moreover, 175 cattle were followed during 11 months. Phylogenetic analyses were performed from virus isolated from unfed pools of mosquitoes. Overall, the estimated mean seroprevalence of infection at the national level was 95.9% (95% CI: [95.2-96.5]) in cattle and 83.7% (95% CI: [81.4-85.9]) in small ruminants. Estimation of incidence rate was 54 per 100 cattle-years assuming that the incidence rate is constant all year along. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that BTV detected belong to serotype 2. In conclusion, our results showed that BTV is endemic in Madagascar and highly prevalent among cattle. In our study we did not work on the vector involved in transmission of BTV in cattle. Thus, research should be conducted to better describe epidemiology of BTV in Madagascar including vectors and assess economic impact of the disease associated to BTV infections.

Masri, B. D. Anderson, G. L. Heil, H. R. Merrill, S. U. Khan, A. Alsahly and G. C. Gray;Elevated Antibodies against Rift Valley Fever Virus among Humans with Exposure to Ruminants in Saudi Arabia;In 2000, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Since then there have been sparse efforts to monitor for RVFV reemergence. During 2012, we enrolled 300 individuals with ruminant exposure and 50 age-group matched non-exposed controls in southwestern KSA, in a cross-sectional epidemiological study of RVFV. Sera from the participants were screened with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-RVFV IgG antibodies of which 39 (11.1%) were positive. Sixteen (41.0%) of those 39 were also positive by a plaque reduction neutralization assay (PRNT). The PRNT-positive subjects were further studied with an IgM ELISA and one was positive. No RVFV was detected in the 350 sera using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Contact with cattle (odds ratio [OR] = 3.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01, 9.90) and a history of chronic medical illness (OR = 6.41, 95% CI 1.75, 23.44) were associated with greater odds of RVFV seropositivity by PRNT. The IgM-positive participant was 36 years of age, and reported multiple risk factors for ruminant contact. Although these findings simply may be vestiges of the 2000 epidemic, KSA's frequent visits from pilgrims and importations of live animals from RVFV-endemic areas suggest that more comprehensive surveillance for imported RVFV virus in ruminants, mosquitoes, and travelers is imperative.;WOS:000352828200012;;;;;;;;Apr;;;10.4269/ajtmh.14-0575;;;;;;;;;;0002-9637;4;American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene;;;"Times Cited: 1; 0

Geubbels;Inter-epidemic Acquisition of Rift Valley Fever Virus in Humans in Tanzania;"Background In East Africa, epidemics of Rift Valley fever (RVF) occur in cycles of 5-15 years following unusually high rainfall. RVF transmission during inter-epidemic periods (IEP) generally passes undetected in absence of surveillance in mammalian hosts and vectors. We studied IEP transmission of RVF and evaluated the demographic, behavioural, occupational and spatial determinants of past RVF infection. Methodology Between March and August 2012 we collected blood samples, and administered a risk factor questionnaire among 606 inhabitants of 6 villages in the seasonally inundated Kilombero Valley, Tanzania. ELISA tests were used to detect RVFV IgM and IgG antibodies in serum samples. Risk factors were examined by mixed effects logistic regression. Findings RVF virus IgM antibodies, indicating recent RVFV acquisition, were detected in 16 participants, representing 2.6% overall and in 22.5% of inhibition ELISA positives (n = 71). Four of 16 (25.0%) IgM positives and 11/71 (15.5%) of individuals with inhibition ELISA sero-positivity reported they had had no previous contact with host animals. Sero-positivity on inhibition ELISA was 11.7%(95% CI 9.2-14.5) and risk was elevated with age (odds ratio (OR) 1.03 per year; 95% CI 1.01-1.04), among milkers (OR 2.19; 95% CI 1.23-3.91), and individuals eating raw meat (OR 4.17; 95% CI 1.18-14.66). Households keeping livestock had a higher probability of having members with evidence of past infection (OR = 3.04, 95% CI = 1.42-6.48) than those that do not keep livestock. Conclusion There is inter-epidemic acquisition of RVFV in Kilombero Valley inhabitants. In the wake of declining malaria incidence, these findings underscore the need for clinicians to consider RVF in the differential diagnosis for febrile illnesses. Several types of direct contact with livestock are important risk factors for past infection with RVFV in this study's population. However, at least part of RVFV transmission appears to have occurred through bites of infected mosquitoes.";WOS:000350992500057;;;;;;;;Feb;;;10.1371/journal.pntd.0003536;;;;;;;;;;1935-2735;2;Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 1; AMURI, Mbaraka/C-5386-2011

The objective of this study was to identify evidence of RVFV exposure in Bodhei Village in a forested area at the edge of the RVFV-epidemic Garissa region. In a household cluster-based survey conducted between epidemics in early 2006, 211 participants were enrolled. Overall seroprevalence for anti-RVFV was high (18%) and comparable with rates in the more arid, dense brush regions farther north. Seroprevalence of adults was 28%, whereas that of children was significantly lower (3%; P < 0.001); the youngest positive child was age 3 years. Males were more likely to be seropositive than females (25% versus 11%; P < 0.01), and animal husbandry activities (birthing, sheltering, and butchering) were strongly associated with seropositivity. The results confirm that significant RVFV transmission occurs outside of recognized high-risk areas and independent of known epidemic periods.";WOS:000349065400036;;;;;;;;Feb;;;10.4269/ajtmh.14-0440;;;;;;;;;;0002-9637;2;American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene;;;"Times Cited: 0; King, Charles/0000-0001-8349-9270

They are spread primarily by blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes, ticks, midges, and sandflies. Changes in climate, ecology, demographic, land-use patterns, and increasing global travel have been linked to an upsurge in arboviral disease. Outbreaks occur periodically followed by persistent low-level circulation. Aim: This study was undertaken to determine the seroepidemiology of selected arboviruses among febrile patients in selected lake/river basins of Kenya. Methods: Using a hospital-based cross-sectional descriptive survey, febrile patients were recruited and their serum samples tested for exposure to immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies against Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), West Nile virus (WNV), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Samples positive for CHIKV and WNV were further confirmed by the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Results: Of the 379 samples examined, 176 were IgG positive for at least one of these arboviruses (46.4%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 41.4-51.5%). Virus-specific prevalence for CCHF, RVF, WN, and CHIK was 25.6%, 19.5%, 12.4%, and 2.6%, respectively. These prevalences varied significantly with geographical site (p<0.001), with Tana recording the highest overall arboviral seropositivity. PRNT results for Alphaviruses confirmed that the actual viruses circulating in Baringo were Semliki Forest virus (SFV) and CHIKV, o'nyong nyong virus (ONNV) in Naivasha, and SFV and Sindbis virus (SINDV) in Tana delta.

Swai and C. Sindato;Seroprevalence of Rift Valley fever virus infection in camels (dromedaries) in northern Tanzania;Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an arthropod-borne viral zoonotic disease that affects a wide range of animals including sheep, goats, cattle, camels and humans. Camels have only recently been introduced into Tanzania and, as a result, there is no credible diseases status information concerning this population, estimated to be in the low hundreds. As part of a broader study on camel diseases in different localities of northern Tanzania, serum samples (n=109) were collected from apparently healthy, non-vaccinated camels during the period June to August 2010 and tested for antibodies specific to RVF virus (RVFV) using the inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Overall, herd and individual camel IgG seroprevalence was 78.5%(11/14) and 27.5%(30/109), respectively. IgG was found to be most prevalent in camels from Kilindi and Hai districts (45 %, each) and in introduced camels from other areas (37.1 %). The relationship between age and seropositivity showed that the seroprevalence was the highest (84.6 %) in age group of >= 10 years and lowest (11.9 %) in age group of <= 5 years. The results of this study reveal that evidence of camels being exposed to RVFV and that the risk of seropositivity varied according to district, being higher in Kilindi and Hai compared with other districts sampled. The risk of seropositivity increased with increasing animal age and the introduction of camels into the herd. Based on these study findings, continuous disease surveillance of camels for RVFV is indicated.;WOS:000348792800011;;;;;;;;Feb;;;10.1007/s11250-014-0726-y;;;;;;;;;;0049-4747;2;Tropical Animal Health and Production;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;347-352;;;Journal Article;;;;Seroprevalence of Rift Valley fever virus infection in camels (dromedaries) in northern Tanzania;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000348792800011;47;2015;andrey.gogin;3;Rift Valley fever virus

O. Paul, P. I. Chiyo, E. Ng'ang'a, V. Otieno, V. Obanda and M. Evander;Spatio-temporal variation in prevalence of Rift Valley fever: a post-epidemic serum survey in cattle and wildlife in Kenya;"BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a fatal arthropod-borne zoonotic disease of livestock and humans. Since the identification of RVF in Kenya in the 1930s, repeated epizootics and epidemics coinciding with El Nino events have occurred in several locations in Africa and Saudi Arabia, causing mass deaths of livestock and humans. RVF is of great interest worldwide because of its negative effect on international livestock trade and its potential to spread globally. The latter is due to the increasing incidence of extreme climatic phenomena caused by global warming, as well as to the increase in global trade and international travel. How RVF is maintained and sustained between epidemics and epizootics is not clearly understood, but it has been speculated that wildlife reservoirs and trans-ovarian transmission in the vector may be important. Several studies have examined the role of wildlife and livestock in isolation or in a limited geographical location within the one country over a short time (usually less than a year). In this study, we examined the seroprevalence of anti-RVF antibodies in cattle and several wildlife species from several locations in Kenya over an inter-epidemic period spanning up to 7 years. METHODS: A serological survey of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to RVF using competitive ELISA was undertaken on 297 serum samples from different wildlife species at various locations in Kenya. The samples were collected between 2008 and 2015. Serum was also collected in 2014 from 177 cattle from Ol Pejeta Conservancy; 113 of the cattle were in close contact with wildlife and the other 64 were kept separate from buffalo and large game by an electric fence. RESULTS: The seroprevalence of RVF virus (RVFV) antibody was 11.6% in wildlife species during the study period. Cattle that could come in contact with wildlife and large game were all negative for RVFV. The seroprevalence was relatively high in elephants, rhinoceros, and buffalo, but there were no antibodies in zebras, baboons, vervet monkeys, or wildebeest. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse species in conservation areas are exposed to RVFV. RVFV exposure in buffalo may indicate distribution of the virus over wide geographical areas beyond known RVFV foci in Kenya. This finding calls for thorough studies on the epizootology of RVFV in specific wildlife species and locations.";MEDLINE:26679561;;;;;;;;2015;;;10.3402/iee.v5.30106;;;;;;;;;;;;Infection ecology & epidemiology;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;30106-30106;;;Journal Article;;;;Spatio-temporal variation in prevalence of Rift Valley fever: a post-epidemic serum survey in cattle and wildlife in Kenya;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://MEDLINE:26679561;5;2015;andrey.gogin;3;Rift Valley fever virus

Cosner, D. L. DeAngelis and S. Ruan;Modelling the Effects of Seasonality and Socioeconomic Impact on the Transmission of Rift Valley Fever Virus;Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an important mosquito-borne viral zoonosis in Africa and the Middle East that causes human deaths and significant economic losses due to huge incidences of death and abortion among infected livestock. Outbreaks of RVF are sporadic and associated with both seasonal and socioeconomic effects. Here we propose an almost periodic three-patch model to investigate the transmission dynamics of RVF virus (RVFV) among ruminants with spatial movements. Our findings indicate that, in Northeastern Africa, human activities, including those associated with the Eid al Adha feast, along with a combination of climatic factors such as rainfall level and hydrological variations, contribute to the transmission and dispersal of the disease pathogen. Moreover, sporadic outbreaks may occur when the two events occur together: 1) abundant livestock are recruited into areas at risk from RVF due to the demand for the religious festival and 2) abundant numbers of mosquitoes emerge. These two factors have been shown to have impacts on the severity of RVF outbreaks. Our numerical results present the transmission dynamics of the disease pathogen over both short and long periods of time, particularly during the festival time. Further, we investigate the impact on patterns of disease outbreaks in each patch brought by festival-and seasonal-driven factors, such as the number of livestock imported daily, the animal transportation speed from patch to patch, and the death rate induced by ceremonial sacrifices. In addition, our simulations show that when the time for festival preparation starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive disease outbreaks rises, particularly in patch 3 (the place where the religious ceremony will be held).;WOS:000349318100016;;;;;;;;Jan;;;10.1371/journal.pntd.0003388;;;;;;;;;;1935-2735;1;Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 1; 0

Two hundred and forty, 6 months old Noaimi lambs of comparable body weight were used. They were divided into six sentinel flocks of 40 lambs each. The animals were stationed in local farms at Al-Hasa, Riyadh, Al-Kharj, Tabouk, Al-Madinah al-Monawarah and Jeddah regions. All lambs were ELISA-negative for antibodies against RVFV and none of them was vaccinated against RVF. The lambs were regularly examined for clinical abnormalities while serum samples were collected from each lamb upon arrival and at 2 months intervals thereafter. The sera were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against RVFV using sheep IgG-sandwich ELISA Method. Out of 3740 serum samples collected from the six flocks over the 3 years period, none was found to be positive for anti-RVFV antibodies. Furthermore, none of the lambs exhibited clinical signs suggestive of RVF. These results indicate absence of viral activity in the studied areas during the survey period. Such results are of significant importance to the prevention and control measures in the Saudi Arabia as well as to the adjacent countries.;CABI:20153256557;;;;;;;;2015;;;;;;;;;;;;;1680-5593;3;Journal of Animal and Veterinary Advances;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;59-62;;;Journal Article;;;;Vertical sero-epidemiological surveillance of Rift Valley Fever in sentinel sheep in Saudi Arabia;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://CABI:20153256557;14;2015;andrey.gogin;3;Rift Valley fever virus

A total of 520 serum samples were screened for anti-Rift Valley fever virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using an inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). An average seroprevalence of 7.67% (range 5% to 20%) was found in ruminants in Seno and Soum provinces, and prevalences of 20% and 22.5% in cattle in Yatenga and Oubritenga provinces, respectively. The location, species and age of the animals were found to influence the seroprevalence. All the ELISA IgG-positive samples were tested for IgM in a competitive ELISA and were found negative, thus ruling out recent infections. The IgG-positive samples, including weak positives, were further tested in a serum neutralisation test for neutralising antibodies and 54.5% of these samples tested positive. The results show that the virus is in circulation in central and northern regions of Burkina Faso, suggesting the need for improved surveillance and control systems to prevent future outbreaks and the consequent economic impact of the disease in Burkina Faso livestock.;WOS:000349815800018;;;;;;;;Dec;;;;;;;;;;;;;0253-1933;3;Revue Scientifique Et Technique-Office International Des Epizooties;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;893-901;;;Journal Article;;;;Prevalence of Rift Valley fever in domestic ruminants in the central and northern regions of Burkina Faso;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000349815800018;33;2014;andrey.gogin;3;Rift Valley fever virus

Zafar;Seroepidemiological survey on Rift Valley fever among small ruminants and their close human contacts in Makkah, Saudi Arabia, in 2011;This study describes a seroepidemiological survey on Rift Valley fever (RVF) among small ruminants and their close human contacts in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. A total of 500 small ruminants (126 local, 374 imported) were randomly selected from the sacrifice livestock yards of Al-Kaakiah slaughterhouse, in the holy city of Makkah, during the pilgrimage season 1432 H (4-9 November 2011). In addition, blood samples were collected from 100 local workers in close contact with the animals at the slaughterhouse. An RVF competition multi-species enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detecting anti-RVF virus immunoglobulin G (IgG)/immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies and an RVF IgM-specific ELISA were used for serological investigations. In total, 84 (16.8%) of the 500 sacrificial sheep and goats tested seropositive in the competition ELISA but no IgM antibodies were detected in the IgM-specific assay. All seropositive samples, comprising 17.91% of the imported animals and 13.49% of the local ones, were therefore designated positive for anti-RVF virus IgG antibody. Among the local personnel working in close contact with the animals, 9% tested seropositive in the RVF competition ELISA. The study indicates that two factors may increase the likelihood of an RVF outbreak among sacrificial animals and pilgrims: i) the large-scale importation of small ruminants into Saudi Arabia from the Horn of Africa shortly before the pilgrimage season, and ii) the movement of animals within Saudi Arabia, from the RVF-endemic south-western area (Jizan region) to the Makkah region, particularly in the few weeks before the pilgrimage season. From these findings, it is recommended that i) all regulations concerning the import of animals into Saudi Arabia from Africa should be rigorously applied, particularly the RVF vaccination of all ruminants destined for export at least two weeks before exportation, and ii) the movement of animals from the RVF-endemic south-western area (Jizan region) of Saudi Arabia to the Makkah region should be strictly prohibited.;WOS:000349815800019;;;;;;;;Dec;;;;;;;;;;;;;0253-1933;3;Revue Scientifique Et Technique-Office International Des Epizooties;;;"Times Cited: 1; 0

However, there is a limited recent information regarding arbovirus circulation, and the associated risk predictors to human exposure are largely unknown. We performed, from November 2010 to February 2011 in the Djibouti city general population, a cross-sectional ELISA and sero-neutralisation-based seroepidemiological analysis nested in a household cohort, which investigated the arboviral infection prevalence and risk factors, stratified by their vectors of transmission.

Determinants of infection identified by multivariate analysis pointed to sociological and environmental exposure to the bite of Aedes mosquitoes. The population was broadly naive against Chikungunya (2.6%) with risk factors mostly shared with dengue. The detection of limited virus circulation was followed by a significant Chikungunya outbreak a few months after our study. Antibodies to West Nile virus were infrequent (0.6%), but the distribution of cases faithfully followed previous mapping of infected Culex mosquitoes. The seroprevalence of Rift valley fever virus was 2.2%, and non-arboviral transmission was suggested. Finally, the study indicated the circulation of Toscana-related viruses (3.7%), and a limited number of cases suggested infection by tick-borne encephalitis or Alkhumra related viruses, which deserve further investigations to identify the viruses and vectors implicated. Overall, most of the arboviral cases' predictors were statistically best described by the individuals' housing space and neighborhood environmental characteristics, which correlated with the ecological actors of their respective transmission vectors' survival in the local niche.

The seroprevalence of RVF was investigated among the human population in Borno State, Nigeria to determine the occurrence of the disease in the study area in comparison with that of Lassa fever and Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic fever. Methods: Recombinant nucleoprotein (rNP)-based IgG-ELISAs for the detection of serum antibodies against RVF virus (RVFV), Lassa fever virus (LASV), and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) were used to test human sera in Borno State, Nigeria. The presence of neutralizing antibody against the RVFV-glycoprotein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotype (RVFVpv) was also determined in the human sera. Results: Of the 297 serum samples tested, 42 (14.1%) were positive for the presence of RVFV-IgG and 22 (7.4%) and 7 (2.4%) of the serum samples were positive for antibodies against LASV and CCHFV, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the titers of neutralizing antibodies obtained using RVFVpv and those obtained using the conventional neutralization assay with the attenuated RVFV-MP12 strain. Conclusions: The seroprevalence of RVF was significantly higher than that of LASV and CCHF in Borno State, Nigeria.

Onyango-Ouma, T. Landmann, R. Sang and M. Mbabu;Occurrence of rift valley fever in cattle in Ijara district, Kenya;Ijara district in Kenya was one of the hotspots of rift valley fever (RVF) during the 2006/2007 outbreak which led to human and animal deaths causing huge economic and public health losses. The main constraint in the control and prevention of RVF is inadequate knowledge on its occurrence during the interepidemic period. This study was aimed at understanding the occurrence of RVF in cattle in tiara to enable the development of improved community-based disease surveillance, prediction, control and prevention. Six herds each 700-1000 cattle were identified with participatory involvement of locals and project technical team of the project. One animal per herd was tagged with global position system (GPS) collar to enable follow up. Sero-surveys were conducted periodically to understand the herd's movement through various ecological zones and risk of exposure to RVF virus. Sixty animals less than 3 years old from each herd were randomly selected each sampling time and sero-surveyed for RVF four times (September 2012, December 2012, February 2013 and May 2013) during the study period and along the nomadic movement route. The serum samples collected were subjected to RVF inhibition ELISA test to detect if there was exposure for RVF virus (RVFV). The RVF inhibition ELISA positive samples were subjected to IgM ELISA test to determine if the exposures were current or recent (within 14 days). The result of the survey indicated that 13.1% (183/1396) of cattle sero-surveyed had RVFV antibodies by inhibition ELISA test while 1.4% (18/1396) was positive for IgM ELISA test. The highest RVFV circulation was detected after herds pass through bony forest between Lamu and Ijara and Halei forested areas. These forested areas also had the highest IgM detections. The findings indicate that even limited rainfall was able to initiate RVFV circulation in Ijara region with highest circulation detected within forested areas with potential to become epidemic if rains persist with extensive flooding. There is need to carry out regular participatory disease surveillance in domestic animals and other host systems to identify risk locations in hotspot areas and carry out community awareness and focal vaccination campaigns against RVF for preparedness, prevention and control. Additionally, monitoring of environmental conditions in risky ecological zones to detect enhanced rainfall and flooding should be prioritized for preparedness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Fagbo, J. A. W. Coetzer and E. H. Venter;Seroprevalence of Rift Valley fever and lumpy skin disease in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in the Kruger National Park and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa;Rift Valley fever and lumpy skin disease are transboundary viral diseases endemic in Africa and some parts of the Middle East, but with increasing potential for global emergence. Wild ruminants, such as the African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), are thought to play a role in the epidemiology of these diseases. This study sought to expand the understanding of the role of buffalo in the maintenance of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) by determining seroprevalence to these viruses during an inter-epidemic period. Buffaloes from the Kruger National Park (n = 138) and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park (n = 110) in South Africa were sampled and tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralising antibodies against LSDV and RVFV using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA) and the serum neutralisation test (SNT). The I-ELISA for LSDV and RVFV detected IgG antibodies in 70 of 248 (28.2%) and 15 of 248 (6.1%) buffaloes, respectively. Using the SNT, LSDV and RVFV neutralising antibodies were found in 5 of 66 (7.6%) and 12 of 57 (21.1%), respectively, of samples tested. The RVFV I-ELISA and SNT results correlated well with previously reported results. Of the 12 SNT RVFV-positive sera, three (25.0%) had very high SNT titres of 1:640. Neutralising antibody titres of more than 1:80 were found in 80.0% of the positive sera tested. The LSDV SNT results did not correlate with results obtained by the I-ELISA and neutralising antibody titres detected were low, with the highest (1:20) recorded in only two buffaloes, whilst 11 buffaloes (4.4%) had evidence of co-infection with both viruses. Results obtained in this study complement other reports suggesting a role for buffaloes in the epidemiology of these diseases during inter-epidemic periods.;WOS:000343371700001;;;;;;;;16-Oct;;;10.4102/jsava.v85i1.1075;;;;;;;;;;1019-9128;1;Journal of the South African Veterinary Association;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;;;;Journal Article;;;;Seroprevalence of Rift Valley fever and lumpy skin disease in African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) in the Kruger National Park and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000343371700001;85;2014;andrey.gogin;3;Rift Valley fever virus

The study area consisted of two parts, including mainland and islands. On the mainland, the study was conducted in nine randomly selected villages and camps. On the islands, samples were collected from all four available sites. A total of 985 serum samples were collected and 924 were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for RVF. A total of 561 samples collected from islands were analyzed using ELISA for Q fever and both ELISA and Rose Bengal tests (RBT) for brucellosis. The apparent RVF seroprevalence by species was 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 34.2-41.3) in cattle, 18.8% (95% CI 12.3-25.2) in goats, and 10.8% (95% CI 3.0-18.5) in sheep. For brucellosis and Q fever, only cattle samples from islands were analyzed. For Q fever, the apparent seroprevalence was 7.8% (95% CI 5.6-10.1). For brucellosis, the RBT showed a prevalence of 5.7% (95% CI 3.8-7.6), and ELISA showed 11.9% (95% CI 9.3-14.6) with a kappa value of 0.53 showing a moderate agreement between the two tests.

Animal populations at locations with high risk of transmission of zoonotic pathogens offer an opportunity to study viral and bacterial pathogens of veterinary and public health concern. Methods: Blood samples were collected from domestic and imported livestock slaughtered at the Muneeb abattoir in central Egypt in 2009. Samples were collected from cattle (n = 161), buffalo (n = 153), sheep (n = 174), and camels (n = 10). Samples were tested for antibodies against Leptospira spp. by a microscopy agglutination test, Coxiella burnetii by enzyme immunoassay, Brucella spp. by standard tube agglutination, and Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV), and sandfly fever Naples virus (SFNV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Antibodies against Leptospira spp. were identified in 64 (40%) cattle, 45 (29%) buffalo, 71 (41%) sheep, and five (50%) camels; antibodies against C. burnetii in six (4%) buffalo, 14 (8%) sheep, and seven (70%) camels; and antibodies against Brucella spp. in 12 (8%) cattle, one (1%) buffalo, seven (4%) sheep, and one (10%) camel. Antibodies against RVFV were detected in two (1%) cattle and five (3%) buffalo, and antibodies against CCHFV in one (1%) cow. No antibodies against SFSV or SFNV were detected in any species. Discussion: Results indicate that livestock have been exposed to a number of pathogens, although care must be taken with interpretation. It is not possible to determine whether antibodies against Leptospira spp. and RVFV in cattle and buffalo are due to prior vaccination or natural exposure. Similarly, antibodies identified in animals less than 6 months of age may be maternal antibodies transferred through colostrum rather than evidence of prior exposure. Results provide baseline evidence to indicate that surveillance within animal populations may be a useful tool to monitor the circulation of pathogens of veterinary and public health concern in Egypt.";WOS:000342147200002;;;;;;;;Sep;;;10.1089/vbz.2013.1525;;;;;;;;;;1530-3667;9;Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;633-639;;;Journal Article;;;;Serosurvey for Zoonotic Viral and Bacterial Pathogens Among Slaughtered Livestock in Egypt;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000342147200002;14;2014;andrey.gogin;3;Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus

Samples were collected from cattle (n = 161), buffalo (n = 153), sheep (n = 174), and camels (n = 10). Samples were tested for antibodies against Leptospira spp. by a microscopy agglutination test, Coxiella burnetii by enzyme immunoassay, Brucella spp. by standard tube agglutination, and Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), sandfly fever Sicilian virus (SFSV), and sandfly fever Naples virus (SFNV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: Antibodies against Leptospira spp. were identified in 64 (40%) cattle, 45 (29%) buffalo, 71 (41%) sheep, and five (50%) camels; antibodies against C. burnetii in six (4%) buffalo, 14 (8%) sheep, and seven (70%) camels; and antibodies against Brucella spp. in 12 (8%) cattle, one (1%) buffalo, seven (4%) sheep, and one (10%) camel. Antibodies against RVFV were detected in two (1%) cattle and five (3%) buffalo, and antibodies against CCHFV in one (1%) cow. No antibodies against SFSV or SFNV were detected in any species. Discussion: Results indicate that livestock have been exposed to a number of pathogens, although care must be taken with interpretation. It is not possible to determine whether antibodies against Leptospira spp. and RVFV in cattle and buffalo are due to prior vaccination or natural exposure. Similarly, antibodies identified in animals less than 6 months of age may be maternal antibodies transferred through colostrum rather than evidence of prior exposure. Results provide baseline evidence to indicate that surveillance within animal populations may be a useful tool to monitor the circulation of pathogens of veterinary and public health concern in Egypt.";WOS:000342147200002;;;;;;;;Sep;;;10.1089/vbz.2013.1525;;;;;;;;;;1530-3667;9;Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;633-639;;;Journal Article;;;;Serosurvey for Zoonotic Viral and Bacterial Pathogens Among Slaughtered Livestock in Egypt;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000342147200002;14;2014;andrey.gogin;3;Rift Valley fever virus

Michel, A. D. Potts, M. R. Jaumally, J. Sauzier and M. Roger;An assessment of Zoonotic and Production Limiting Pathogens in Rusa Deer (Cervus timorensis rusa) from Mauritius;A population of approximately 70 000 rusa deer (Cervus timorensis russa) represents the most important mammal species reared for food on the island of Mauritius, being the main source of red meat for the local population. However, very limited information is available on the circulation of pathogens affecting the productivity and health of this species. To produce baseline data on the circulation of infectious pathogens in rusa deer under production, a serological survey and/or direct pathogen detection for six selected infectious diseases was undertaken in 2007 in a sample of 53% of the herds reared in semi-free-ranging conditions in hunting estates. Seropositive results were recorded for Johne's disease with an indirect ELISA test (1.7%, n = 351), heartwater with an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) (95.5%, n = 178) and leptospirosis with a Microscopic Agglutination Test (MAT) (25.9%, n = 363). Significant associations were found between seroprevalence to some of the leptospiral serogroups detected (Tarassovi, Pomona, Sejroe and Mini) and age of the animals, animal density or location of the estates (being more prevalent in hotter and more humid areas). In addition, Mycobacterium bovis and M. avium subspecies paratuberculosis were confirmed in two deer carcasses by culture and PCR, respectively. No antibodies against Brucella spp. nor Rift Valley Fever virus were detected with the use of respective indirect ELISA's. The results obtained suggest that the population of rusa deer from Mauritius is exposed to a wide range of pathogens which may affect their productivity. In addition, the results highlight the potential public health risks incurred by deer industry workers and consumers. This survey fills an important gap in knowledge regarding the health of tropical deer meat in Mauritius and justifies the need to implement more regular surveys of selected pathogens in the deer population.;WOS:000340537900005;;;;;;;;Aug;;;10.1111/tbed.12206;;;;;;;;;;1865-1674;;Transboundary and Emerging Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 2; SI

Faharoudine, C. Foray, M.-M. Olive, M. Maquart, A. Soulaimane, A. M. Kassim, C. Cetre-Sossah and E. Cardinale;Evidence for Circulation of the Rift Valley Fever Virus among Livestock in the Union of Comoros;Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne phlebovirus reported to be circulating in most parts of Africa. Since 2009, RVFV has been suspected of continuously circulating in the Union of Comoros. To estimate the incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition in the Comorian ruminant population, 191 young goats and cattle were selected in six distinct zones and sampled periodically from April 2010 to August 2011. We found an estimated incidence of RVFV antibody acquisition of 17.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): [8.9-26.1]) with a significant difference between islands (8.2% in Grande Comore, 72.3% in Moheli and 5.8% in Anjouan). Simultaneously, a longitudinal entomological survey was conducted and ruminant trade-related information was collected. No RVFV RNA was detected out of the 1,568 blood-sucking caught insects, including three potential vectors of RVFV mosquito species. Our trade survey suggests that there is a continuous flow of live animals from eastern Africa to the Union of Comoros and movements of ruminants between the three Comoro islands. Finally, a cross-sectional study was performed in August 2011 at the end of the follow-up. We found an estimated RVFV antibody prevalence of 19.3% (95% CI: [15.6%-23.0%]). Our findings suggest a complex RVFV epidemiological cycle in the Union of Comoros with probable inter-islands differences in RVFV circulation patterns. Moheli, and potentially Anjouan, appear to be acting as endemic reservoir of infection whereas RVFV persistence in Grande Comore could be correlated with trade in live animals with the eastern coast of Africa. More data are needed to estimate the real impact of the disease on human health and on the national economy.;WOS:000340551500069;;;;;;;;Jul;;;10.1371/journal.pntd.0003045;;;;;;;;;;1935-2735;7;Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 1; 0

Lejlifa, S. J. Hamdi, A. Di Gennaro, G. Savini and M. V. Thrusfield;Evidence of rift valley fever seroprevalence in the Sahrawi semi-nomadic pastoralist system, Western Sahara;Background: The increasing global importance of Rift Valley fever (RVF) is clearly demonstrated by its geographical expansion. The presence of a wide range of host and vector species, and the epidemiological characteristics of RVF, have led to concerns that epidemics will continue to occur in previously unaffected regions of Africa. The proximity of the Sahrawi territories of Western Sahara to endemic countries, such as Mauritania, Senegal, and Mali with periodic isolation of virus and serological evidence of RVF, and the intensive livestock trade in the region results in a serious risk of RVF spread in the Sahrawi territories, and potentially from there to the Maghreb and beyond. A sero-epidemiological survey was conducted in the Saharawi territories between March and April 2008 to investigate the possible presence of the RVF virus (RVFV) and associated risk factors. A two-stage cluster sampling design was used, incorporating 23 sampling sites. Results: A total of 982 serum samples was collected from 461 sheep, 463 goats and 58 camels. Eleven samples (0.97%) tested positive for IgG against the RVFV. There were clusters of high seroprevalence located mostly in the Tifariti (7.69%) and Mehaires (7.14%) regions, with the Tifariti event having been found in one single flock (4/26 positive animals). Goats and older animals were at a significantly increased risk being seropositive (p = 0.007 and p = 0.007, respectively). Conclusion: The results suggest potential RVF activity in the study area, where intense livestock movement and trade with neighbouring countries might be considered as a primary determinant in the spread of the disease. The importance of a continuous field investigation is reinforced, in light of the risk of RVF expansion to historically unaffected regions of Africa.;WOS:000335185800001;;;;;;;;24-Apr;;;10.1186/1746-6148-10-92;;;;;;;;;;1746-6148;;Bmc Veterinary Research;;;"Times Cited: 2; Institute, Pirbright/K-4476-2014

Sallu and M. Yongolo;Molecular detection of Rift Valley fever virus in serum samples from selected areas of Tanzania;Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute mosquito-borne viral zoonotic disease affecting domestic animals and humans caused by the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The virus belongs to the genus Phlebovirus of the family Bunyaviridae. The main aim of this study was to detect the presence of antibodies to RVFV as well as the virus in the serum samples that were collected from livestock during the 2006/2007 RVF outbreaks in different locations in Tanzania. Analysis of selected samples was done using a RVF-specific inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Genomic viral RNA was extracted directly from serum samples using a QIAampA (R) Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN), and a one-step RT-PCR protocol was used to amplify the S segment of RVFV. Positive results were obtained in 39.5 % (n = 200) samples using the RVF I-ELISA, and 17.6 % (n = 108) of samples were positive by RT-PCR. I-ELISA detected 41 (38.7 %), 32 (39.0 %), and 6 (50.0 %) positive results in cattle, goats, and sheep sera, respectively, whereas the RT-PCR detected 11 (0.2 %), 7 (0.2 %), and 1 (0.1 %) positive results in cattle, goats, and sheep sera, respectively. These findings have demonstrated the presence of RVFV in Tanzania during the 2006/2007 RVF outbreaks. To our knowledge, this is the first report to detect RVFV in serum samples from domestic animals in Tanzania using PCR technique. Therefore, a detailed molecular study to characterize the virus from different geographical locations in order to establish the profile of strains circulating in the country and develop more effective and efficient control strategies should be done.;WOS:000332984700006;;;;;;;;Apr;;;10.1007/s11250-014-0540-6;;;;;;;;;;0049-4747;4;Tropical Animal Health and Production;;;"Times Cited: 2; 0

A third cross-sectional survey showed a seroconversion rate of 14% in 2010-2011. In 2011 the longitudinal study suggested a RVFV circulation during the year. In this area where vectors density is low and cattle exchanges are linked to the virus local spread, we raise hypotheses that may explain the local persistence of the virus.;WOS:000331009000014;;;;;;;;Feb;;;10.4269/ajtmh.13-;;;;;;;;;;0002-9637;2;American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene;;;"Times Cited: 1; Durand, Benoit/0000-0003-0669-1394

Venter;Seroprevalence of Rift Valley fever and lumpy skin disease in African buffalo ( Syncerus caffer) in the Kruger National Park and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa;Rift Valley fever and lumpy skin disease are transboundary viral diseases endemic in Africa and some parts of the Middle East, but with increasing potential for global emergence. Wild ruminants, such as the African buffalo ( Syncerus caffer), are thought to play a role in the epidemiology of these diseases. This study sought to expand the understanding of the role of buffalo in the maintenance of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) by determining seroprevalence to these viruses during an inter-epidemic period. Buffaloes from the Kruger National Park ( n=138) and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park ( n=110) in South Africa were sampled and tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG) and neutralising antibodies against LSDV and RVFV using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (I-ELISA) and the serum neutralisation test (SNT). The I-ELISA for LSDV and RVFV detected IgG antibodies in 70 of 248 (28.2%) and 15 of 248 (6.1%) buffaloes, respectively. Using the SNT, LSDV and RVFV neutralising antibodies were found in 5 of 66 (7.6%) and 12 of 57 (21.1%), respectively, of samples tested. The RVFV I-ELISA and SNT results correlated well with previously reported results. Of the 12 SNT RVFV-positive sera, three (25.0%) had very high SNT titres of 1:640. Neutralising antibody titres of more than 1:80 were found in 80.0% of the positive sera tested. The LSDV SNT results did not correlate with results obtained by the I-ELISA and neutralising antibody titres detected were low, with the highest (1:20) recorded in only two buffaloes, whilst 11 buffaloes (4.4%) had evidence of co-infection with both viruses. Results obtained in this study complement other reports suggesting a role for buffaloes in the epidemiology of these diseases during inter-epidemic periods.;CABI:20153127585;;;;;;;;2014;;;;;;;;;;;;;1019-9128;1;Journal of the South African Veterinary Association;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;Art. #1075-Art. #1075;;;Journal Article;;;;Seroprevalence of Rift Valley fever and lumpy skin disease in African buffalo ( Syncerus caffer) in the Kruger National Park and Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://CABI:20153127585;85;2014;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;Rift Valley fever virus

Among livestock, outbreaks of the disease are economically devastating. They are often characterised by large, sweeping abortion storms and have significant mortality in adult livestock. The aim of the current study was to investigate RVFV infection in the Kigoma region, which is nestled under the hills of the western arm of the Great Rift Valley on the edge of Lake Tanganyika, Tanzania. A region-wide serosurvey was conducted on non-vaccinated small ruminants (sheep and goats, n = 411). Sera samples were tested for the presence of anti-RVFV antibodies and viral antigen, using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The overall past infections were detected in 22 of the 411 animals, 5.4% (Confidence Interval [CI] 95% = 3.5% -8.1%). The Kigoma rural area recorded the higher seroprevalence of 12.0% (CI 95% = 7.3% -18.3%; p < 0.0001), followed by Kibondo at 2.3% (CI 95% = 0.5% -6.5%; p > 0.05) and the Kasulu district at 0.8% (CI 95% = 0.0% -4.2%; p > 0.05). The prevalence was 12.5% and 4.7% for sheep and goats, respectively. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction results indicated that only eight samples were found to be positive (n = 63). This study has confirmed, for the first time, the presence of the RVFV in the Kigoma region four years after the 2007 epizootic in Tanzania. The study further suggests that the virus activity exists during the inter-epizootic period, even in regions with no history of RVFV.";WOS:000345393300003;;;;;;;;2014;;;10.4102/ojvr.v81i2.717;;;;;;;;;;0030-2465;2;Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research;;;"Times Cited: 0; 4

Vina-Rodriguez, B. Doumbia and M. H. Groschup;Molecular and Serological Studies on the Rift Valley Fever Outbreak in Mauritania in 2010;Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a vector-borne RNA virus affecting humans, livestock and wildlife. In October/November 2010, after a period of unusually heavy rainfall, a Rift Valley fever outbreak occurred in northern Mauritania causing clinical cases in cattle, sheep, goats and camels, 21 of which were of lethal outcome. The aim of this study was to obtain further information on the continuation of RVF virus activity and spread in animal species in Mauritania after this outbreak. We therefore tested sera from small ruminants, cattle and camels for the presence of viral RNA and antibodies against RVFV. These sera were collected in different parts of the country from December 2010 to February 2011 and tested with three different ELISAs and an indirect immunofluorescence assay. The results show a high seroprevalence of RVFV IgM and IgG antibodies of about 57% in all animals investigated. Moreover, in four camel sera, viral RNA was detected emphasizing the important role camels played during the latest RVF outbreak in Mauritania. The study demonstrates the continuous spread of RVFV in Mauritania after initial emergence and highlights the potential role of small ruminants and camels in virus dissemination.;WOS:000326839500006;;;;;;;;Nov;;;10.1111/tbed.12142;;;;;;;;;;1865-1674;;Transboundary and Emerging Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 3; SI

Humans and horses are susceptible to WNV but are dead-end hosts. WNV is endemic in Senegal, particularly in the Senegal River Delta. To assess transmission patterns and potential vectors, entomological and sentinel serological was done in Ross Bethio along the River Senegal. Three sentinel henhouses (also used as chicken-baited traps) were set at 100 m, 800 m, and 1,300 m from the river, the latter close to a horse-baited trap. Blood samples were taken from sentinel chickens at 2-week intervals. Seroconversions were observed in sentinel chickens in November and December. Overall, the serological incidence rate was 4.6% with 95% confidence interval (0.9; 8.4) in the sentinel chickens monitored for this study. Based on abundance pattern, Culex neavei was the most likely mosquito vector involved in WNV transmission to sentinel chickens, and a potential bridge vector between birds and mammals.";WOS:000330520500013;;;;;;;;Oct;;;10.3390/ijerph10104718;;;;;;;;;;1660-4601;10;International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;;;"Times Cited: 2; 0

Filleul;Rift Valley Fever in Humans and Animals in Mayotte, an Endemic Situation?;Retrospective studies and surveillance on humans and animals revealed that Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) has been circulating on Mayotte for at least several years. A study was conducted in 2011 to estimate the seroprevalence of RVF in humans and in animals and to identify associated risk factors. Using a multistage cluster sampling method, 1420 individuals were enrolled in the human study, including 337 children aged 5 to 14 years. For the animal study, 198 seronegative ruminants from 33 randomly selected sentinel ruminant herds were followed up for more than one year. In both studies, information on environment and risk factors was collected through a standardized questionnaire. The overall weighted seroprevalence of RVFV antibodies in the general population aged >= 5 years was 3.5% (95% CI 2.6-4.8). The overall seroprevalence of RVFV antibodies in the ruminant population was 25.3% (95% CI 19.8-32.2). Age (>= 15), gender (men), place of birth on the Comoros, living in Mayotte since less than 5 years, low educational level, farming and living close to a water source were significantly associated with RVFV seropositivity in humans. Major risk factors for RFV infection in animals were the proximity of the farm to a water point, previous two-month rainfall and absence of abortions disposal. Although resulting in few clinical cases in humans and in animals, RVFV has been circulating actively on the island of Mayotte, in a context of regular import of the virus from nearby countries through illegal animal movements, the presence of susceptible animals and a favorable environment for mosquito vectors to maintain virus transmission locally. Humans and animals share the same ways of RVFV transmission, with mosquitoes playing an important role. The studies emphasize the need for a one health approach in which humans and animals within their ecosystems are included.;WOS:000325423500008;;;;;;;;30-Sep;;;10.1371/journal.pone.0074192;;;;;;;;;;1932-6203;9;Plos One;;;"Times Cited: 4; 0

W. Magona, T. Galiwango, J. Walubengo and G. Mukiibi;Rift Valley fever in Uganda: Seroprevalence and risk factor surveillance vis-a-vis mosquito vectors, anti-RVF virus IgG and RVF virus neutralizing antibodies in goats;Increasing occurrence of outbreaks of Rift Valley fever (RVF) has been reported in Kenya, Somalia, Tanzania, Sudan, Madagascar and South Africa during heavy and prolonged, often unseasonal, rainfall from 1997 to 2009. Given Uganda's location in the endemic zone of RVF, surveys were conducted on goat farms with a view to establishing presence of RVF virus and existence of its mosquito vectors. A total of 1470 sera were tested using the IgG ELISA and subsequently 700 sera tested using the Virus Neutralization Test (VNT) and a species identification survey for mosquitoes undertaken. The findings revealed an overall seroprevalence of anti-RVF virus IgG of 9.8% (95% CI, 8.5-11.1%). VNT revealed a seroprevalence of 24.3% (95% CI, 21.1-27.5%). The following specific farms had a higher likelihood to have seropositive goats: Lubega (OR 3.5 (1.1-11.3)), Katabarwa (OR 6.4 (2.0-20.5)) and Maduwa (OR 5.3 (1.6-16.7)). Mubende goats were 4 times (OR 4.2 (1.3-13.5)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than Boer goats, and adult goats were 2 times (OR 2.2 (1.5-3.3)) more likely to be seropositive to RVF virus than young ones. Mosquito species found, included, Anopheles gambiae (71.2%), Culex sp. (21.5%), Anopheles funestus (6.5%), Aedes sp. (0.7%) and Mansonia sp. (0.2%). High prevalence of anti-RVFV IgG in goats in some locations together with presence of RVF virus neutralizing antibodies (up to 1:80) suggested that the RVF virus is endemic in goats in Uganda. Presence of RVF virus coupled with existence of Aedes sp. and Culex sp. mosquito vectors are likely to lead to RVF outbreaks once the mosquito population flares-up due to flooding and increased RVF virus amplification occurs.

M. Borland, M. Cranfield and A. M. Powers;PREVALENCE OF ANTIBODIES TO ALPHAVIRUSES AND FLAVIVIRUSES IN FREE-RANGING GAME ANIMALS AND NONHUMAN PRIMATES IN THE GREATER CONGO BASIN;Vector-borne and zoonotic pathogens have comprised a significant proportion of the emerging infectious diseases in humans in recent decades. The role of many wildlife species as reservoirs for arthropod-borne viral pathogens is poorly understood. We investigated the exposure history of various African wildlife species from the Congo basin to mosquito-borne flaviviruses and alphaviruses by testing archived serum samples. Sera from 24 African forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), 34 African elephants (Loxodonta africana), 40 duikers (Cephalophus and Philantomba spp.), 25 mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), 32 mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), five Grauer's gorillas (Gorilla beringei graueri), two L'Hoest's monkeys (Cercopithecus lhoesti), two golden monkeys (Cercopithecus kandti), and three chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) sampled between 1991 and 2009 were tested for antibodies against chikungunya virus (CHIKV), o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV), West Nile virus (WNV), dengue 2 virus (DENV-2), and yellow fever virus (YFV) by plaque reduction neutralization test. Specific neutralizing antibodies against ONNV were found in African forest buffalo in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Gabon, duikers in the DRC, and mandrills in Gabon, providing novel evidence of enzootic circulation of ONNV in these countries. African forest buffalo in the DRC and Gabon also demonstrated evidence of exposure to CHIKV, WNV, and DENV-2, while mandrills in Gabon were antibody positive for CHIKV, DENV-2, WNV, and YFV. All of the elephants tested had a strong neutralizing antibody response to WNV. We also document results from a survey of gorillas for arboviruses, of which 4/32 (13%) had antibody to an alphavirus or flavivirus. Overall, our results demonstrate a high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies against multiple arboviruses in wildlife in equatorial Africa.;WOS:000321798500014;;;;;;;;Jul;;;10.7589/2012-08-212;;;;;;;;;;0090-3558;3;Journal of Wildlife Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 6; 0

Wilson;Rift Valley Fever Risk Map Model and Seroprevalence in Selected Wild Ungulates and Camels from Kenya;Since the first isolation of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in the 1930s, there have been multiple epizootics and epidemics in animals and humans in sub-Saharan Africa. Prospective climate-based models have recently been developed that flag areas at risk of RVFV transmission in endemic regions based on key environmental indicators that precede Rift Valley fever (RVF) epizootics and epidemics. Although the timing and locations of human case data from the 2006-2007 RVF outbreak in Kenya have been compared to risk zones flagged by the model, seroprevalence of RVF antibodies in wildlife has not yet been analyzed in light of temporal and spatial predictions of RVF activity. Primarily wild ungulate serum samples from periods before, during, and after the 2006-2007 RVF epizootic were analyzed for the presence of RVFV IgM and/or IgG antibody. Results show an increase in RVF seropositivity from samples collected in 2007 (31.8%), compared to antibody prevalence observed from 2000-2006 (3.3%). After the epizootic, average RVF seropositivity diminished to 5% in samples collected from 2008-2009. Overlaying maps of modeled RVF risk assessments with sampling locations indicated positive RVF serology in several species of wild ungulate in or near areas flagged as being at risk for RVF. Our results establish the need to continue and expand sero-surveillance of wildlife species Kenya and elsewhere in the Horn of Africa to further calibrate and improve the RVF risk model, and better understand the dynamics of RVFV transmission.;ZOOREC:ZOOR15003009059;;;;;;;;04-Jun;;;;;;;;;;;;;1932-6203;6;PLoS ONE;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;14-Jan;;;Journal Article;;;;Rift Valley Fever Risk Map Model and Seroprevalence in Selected Wild Ungulates and Camels from Kenya;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://ZOOREC:ZOOR15003009059;8;2013;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;Rift Valley fever virus

A. Al Azraqi, A. A. El Mekki and A. A. Mahfouz;Rift Valley fever among children and adolescents in southwestern Saudi Arabia;Purpose: Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus has expanded its geographical range, reaching Asia in 2000. This work investigated RVF seroprevalence among children born after the 2000-2001 outbreak in Saudi Arabia and compared it with the seroprevalence of adolescents born before the outbreak. Design: In a seroepidemiological study in southwestern Saudi Arabia (Jazan, Aseer, and Al-Qunfuda), a random sample of 389 children and adolescents was investigated. Data were collected regarding the subjects' sociodemographic status, housing conditions, and animal contact. Blood samples were collected and tested for RVF-specific IgG and IgM. Results: None of the study samples were found to be seropositive for anti-RVF virus IgM. None of the study subjects aged 1-8 years (born after the outbreak) were positive for RVF-specific IgG. In contrast, 14 subjects (4.8%) aged 9-19 years (born before the outbreak) were positive for RVF-specific IgG. Among adolescents in our study, 4.9% were positive for anti-RVF IgG. This study showed that among adolescents, a history of contact with aborted animals (aOR = 13.361, 95% CI = 5.091-35.072) and transporting aborted animals (aOR = 18.861, 95% CI = 11.125-31.622) were significant risk factors. Conclusions: Despite the low virus activity recently reported among animals, neither clinically apparent RVF infections nor outbreaks among humans have been documented, indicating that the control measures taken by the Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Health are effective.

Berkvens;Inter-epidemic Transmission of Rift Valley Fever in Livestock in the Kilombero River Valley, Tanzania: A Cross-Sectional Survey;"BackgroundIn recent years, evidence of Rift Valley fever (RVF) transmission during inter-epidemic periods in parts of Africa has increasingly been reported. The inter-epidemic transmissions generally pass undetected where there is no surveillance in the livestock or human populations. We studied the presence of and the determinants for inter-epidemic RVF transmission in an area experiencing annual flooding in southern Tanzania.MethodologyA cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted in randomly selected cattle, sheep and goats in the Kilombero river valley from May to August 2011, approximately four years after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak in Tanzania. The exposure status to RVF virus (RVFV) was determined using two commercial ELISA kits, detecting IgM and IgG antibodies in serum. Information about determinants was obtained through structured interviews with herd owners.FindingsAn overall seroprevalence of 11.3% (nâ€Š=â€Š1680) was recorded; 5.5% in animals born after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak and 22.7% in animals present during the outbreak. There was a linear increase in prevalence in the post-epidemic annual cohorts. Nine inhibition-ELISA positive samples were also positive for RVFV IgM antibodies indicating a recent infection. The spatial distribution of seroprevalence exhibited a few hotspots. The sex difference in seroprevalence in animals born after the previous epidemic was not significant (6.1% vs. 4.6% for females and males respectively, pâ€Š=â€Š0.158) whereas it was significant in animals present during the outbreak (26.0% vs. 7.8% for females and males respectively, p<0.001). Animals living >15 km from the flood plain were more likely to have antibodies than those living <5 km (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.04-3.56). Species, breed, herd composition, grazing practices and altitude were not associated with seropositivity.ConclusionThese findings indicate post-epidemic transmission of RVFV in the study area. The linear increase in seroprevalence in the post-epidemic annual cohorts implies a constant exposure and presence of active foci transmission preceding the survey.";DRCI:DATA2015149007157462;;;;;;;;2015-06-04;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0002356.s001;;;;;;;;;;;;Figshare;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;;;;Journal Article;;;;Inter-epidemic Transmission of Rift Valley Fever in Livestock in the Kilombero River Valley, Tanzania: A Cross-Sectional Survey;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://DRCI:DATA2015149007157462;1;2013;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;Rift Valley fever virus

To investigate Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in these animals, serological examinations including Virus neutralization Test (VNT) were performed on 270 camel serum samples. Positive results were obtained in 140 (51.85%) camels thus tested. Seventy five percent of seropositive camels were adult â‰¥ than 4 years old and the remaining 25% were young ranging from 8 months to 4 years. The results of the questionnaires administrated during the sampling to the shepherds and owners showed that association of abortion and mortalities in young animals were often observed. The survey revealed that high prevalence of RVFV is observed in camels in the sahelian desert zone of Burkina Faso which is not routinely diagnosed. Recommendations for systematic RVF investigation in camels and others domestic ruminants were made in order to improve the animal productivity. Habitual consumption of raw milk and close contact with infected animals signify possible zoonotic importance of RVF in the studied area. A risk assessment of the disease should be also undertaken in order to understanding the epidemiology and knowledge of the disease in the country and the sahelian region.;CABI:20143259647;;;;;;;;2013;;;;;;;;;;;;;0378-9721;4;Bulletin of Animal Health and Production in Africa;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;643-649;;;Journal Article;;;;Rift Valley Fever in camels in Northern Burkina Faso;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://CABI:20143259647;61;2013;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;Rift Valley fever virus

In 2 eastern coast towns, IgG seroprevalence against CHIKV was 45% and 23%; IgM seroprevalence was 28% and 5%. IgG seroprevalence against DENV was 17% and 11%. No anti-DENV IgM was detected. At 4 locations, 450-1,300 m high, IgG seroprevalence against CHIKV was 0%-3%, suggesting CHIKV had not spread to higher inland-altitudes. Four women had IgG against RVFV, probably antibodies from a 2008 epidemic. Most (78%) women from coastal locations with CHIKV-specific IgG reported joint pain and stiffness; 21% reported no symptoms. CHIKV infection was significantly associated with high bodyweight. The outbreak was an isolated CHIKV epidemic without relevant DENV co-transmission.";WOS:000328172600009;;;;;;;;Nov;;;10.3201/eid1811.111036;;;;;;;;;;1080-6040;11;Emerging Infectious Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 5; Schmidt-Chanasit, Jonas/0000-0003-4433-0231

The study excludes the southwestern region where a major outbreak of RVF occurred in 2000 and where annual vaccination of ruminants is practiced. Sheep and goat IgG-sandwich ELISA were used to test serum samples from sheep and goats, and bovine IgG-sandwich ELISA was used to test cattle sera. A nonspecies-specific, nonantibody isotype-specific ELISA was used to test camel sera. A total of 3,480 sheep, goats, cattle and camels with no previous history of vaccination against RVFV were randomly tested. All tested animals were negative for IgG class antibodies against the virus except four out of 1,508 sheep and three out of 913 goats, which tested positive. All animals were clinically normal and no evidence was found of virus activity in the studied areas. It is, therefore, most likely that those rare positive cases, which constituted 0.002% of the total animals tested, were either false positives or vaccinates smuggled from the outbreak zone. The need for regular monitoring of animals both within the outbreak zone of 2000 and other parts of the kingdom is strongly emphasized.;WOS:000308359100031;;;;;;;;Oct;;;10.1007/s11250-012-0100-x;;;;;;;;;;0049-4747;7;Tropical Animal Health and Production;;;"Times Cited: 3; 0

Mahfouz;Rift Valley Fever in Southwestern Saudi Arabia: A sero-epidemiological study seven years after the outbreak of 2000-2001;The objective of the present study was to measure seroepidemiology of Rift Valley Fever virus infection in the Southwestern regions of Saudi Arabia and to determine the potential risk factors leading to Rift Valley Fever virus infection. Through a series of field trips to the study area (Jizan, Aseer and Al-Qunfuda), a random sample of the general population (patients and their relatives) attending the outpatients' clinics for any reasons were included. Through questionnaire interviews, data were collected regarding their sociodemographic status, housing conditions, animal contact and other relevant information. Blood samples were taken and tested for RVF-specific IgG and IgM utilizing commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Out of 2322 persons included in the study, only 139 were positive for RVF-specific IgG thus giving an overall prevalence of 6.0%. On the other hand, none of the study samples were found to be sero-positive to RVF-specific IgM. The study revealed zero prevalence of specific IgM and IgG among pre-school children born after the 2000-2001 outbreaks. Using multivariate binary logistic regression analysis to identify potential risk factors associated with sero-positive RVF IgG, the following significant risk factors were identified: lack of electricity, having animals in the house, history of slaughtering animals, contact with or transporting aborted animals. The study documented the lack of recent RVF activity among humans in the study areas since the outbreak of 2000 and therefore, the rigorous control measures undertaken together with fostering public health messages in the region should be maintained to reduce the risk of animal-to-human transmission as a result of unsafe animal husbandry and slaughtering practices.

Hoelscher;High Seroprevalence of Rift Valley Fever and Evidence for Endemic Circulation in Mbeya Region, Tanzania, in a Cross-Sectional Study;Background: The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne phlebovirus. RVFV mostly causes outbreaks among domestic ruminants with a major economic impact. Human infections are associated with these events, with a fatality rate of 0.5-2%. Since the virus is able to use many mosquito species of temperate climates as vectors, it has a high potential to spread to outside Africa. Methodology/Principal Findings: We conducted a stratified, cross-sectional sero-prevalence survey in 1228 participants from Mbeya region, southwestern Tanzania. Samples were selected from 17,872 persons who took part in a cohort study in 2007 and 2008. RVFV IgG status was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. Possible risk factors were analyzed using uni-and multi-variable Poisson regression models. We found a unique local maximum of RVFV IgG prevalence of 29.3% in a study site close to Lake Malawi (N = 150). The overall seroprevalence was 5.2%. Seropositivity was significantly associated with higher age, lower socio-economic status, ownership of cattle and decreased with distance to Lake Malawi. A high vegetation density, higher minimum and lower maximum temperatures were found to be associated with RVFV IgG positivity. Altitude of residence, especially on a small scale in the high-prevalence area was strongly correlated (PR 0.87 per meter, 95% CI = 0.80-0.94). Abundant surface water collections are present in the lower areas of the high-prevalence site. RVF has not been diagnosed clinically, nor an outbreak detected in the high-prevalence area. Conclusions: RVFV is probably circulating endemically in the region. The presence of cattle, dense vegetation and temperate conditions favour mosquito propagation and virus replication in the vector and seem to play major roles in virus transmission and circulation. The environmental risk-factors that we identified could serve to more exactly determine areas at risk for RVFV endemicity.;WOS:000302132100014;;;;;;;;Mar;;;10.1371/journal.pntd.0001557;;;;;;;;;;1935-2727;3;Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 18; Hoelscher, Michael/D-3436-2012; Heinrich, Norbert/B-3750-2014

Rakotondravao;An Unexpected Recurrent Transmission of Rift Valley Fever Virus in Cattle in a Temperate and Mountainous Area of Madagascar;Rift Valley fever is an acute, zoonotic viral disease of domestic ruminants, caused by a phlebovirus (Bunyaviridae family). A large outbreak occurred in Madagascar in 2008-2009. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the point prevalence of antibodies against Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) in cattle in the Anjozorobe district, located in the wet and temperate highland region of Madagascar and yet heavily affected by the disease, and analyse environmental and trade factors potentially linked to RVFV transmission. A serological study was performed in 2009 in 894 bovines. For each bovine, the following variables were recorded: age, location of the night pen, minimum distance from the pen to the nearest water point and the forest, nearest water point type, and herd replacement practices. The serological data were analyzed using a generalized linear mixed model. The overall anti-RVFV IgG seroprevalence rate was 28% [CI95% 25-31]. Age was statistically linked to prevalence (p = 10(-4)), being consistent with a recurrent RVFV circulation. Distance from the night pen to the nearest water point was a protective factor (p = 5.10(-3)), which would be compatible with a substantial part of the virus transmission being carried out by nocturnal mosquito vectors. However, water point type did not influence the risk of infection: several mosquito species are probably involved. Cattle belonging to owners who purchase animals to renew the herd were significantly more likely to have seroconverted than others (p = 0.04): cattle trade may contribute to the introduction of the virus in this area. The minimum distance of the night pen to the forest was not linked to the prevalence. This is the first evidence of a recurrent transmission of RVFV in such an ecosystem that associates a wet, temperate climate, high altitude, paddy fields, and vicinity to a dense rain forest. Persistence mechanisms need to be further investigated.;WOS:000298667700028;;;;;;;;Dec;;;10.1371/journal.pntd.0001423;;;;;;;;;;1935-2727;12;Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 13; HERAUD, Jean-Michel/O-1464-2013; Durand, Benoit/

Sutherland, S. Dahir, G. Gildengorin, J. Morrill, E. M. Muchiri, C. J. Peters and C. H. King;Postepidemic Analysis of Rift Valley Fever Virus Transmission in Northeastern Kenya: A Village Cohort Study;Background: In endemic areas, Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a significant threat to both human and animal health. Goals of this study were to measure human anti-RVFV seroprevalence in a high-risk area following the 2006-2007 Kenyan Rift Valley Fever (RVF) epidemic, to identify risk factors for interval seroconversion, and to monitor individuals previously exposed to RVFV in order to document the persistence of their anti-RVFV antibodies. Methodology/Findings: We conducted a village cohort study in Ijara District, Northeastern Province, Kenya. One hundred two individuals tested for RVFV exposure before the 2006-2007 RVF outbreak were restudied to determine interval anti-RVFV seroconversion and persistence of humoral immunity since 2006. Ninety-two additional subjects were enrolled from randomly selected households to help identify risk factors for current seropositivity. Overall, 44/194 or 23% (CI95%:17%-29%) of local residents were RVFV seropositive. 1/85 at-risk individuals restudied in the follow-up cohort had seroconverted since early 2006. 27/92 (29%, CI95%:20%-39%) of newly tested individuals were seropositive. All 13 individuals with positive titers (by plaque reduction neutralization testing (PRNT80)) in 2006 remained positive in 2009. After adjustment in multivariable logistic models, age, village, and drinking raw milk were significantly associated with RVFV seropositivity. Visual impairment (defined as <= 20/80) was much more likely in the RVFV-seropositive group (P<0.0001). Conclusions: Our results highlight significant variability in RVFV exposure in two neighboring villages having very similar climate, terrain, and insect density. Among those with previous exposure, RVFV titers remained at >1:40 for more than 3 years. In concordance with previous studies, residents of the more rural village were more likely to be seropositive and RVFV seropositivity was associated with poor visual acuity. Raw milk consumption was strongly associated with RVFV exposure, which may represent an important new focus for public health education during future RVF outbreaks.;WOS:000294479800020;;;;;;;;Aug;;;10.1371/journal.pntd.0001265;;;;;;;;;;1935-2735;8;Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 18; King, Charles/0000-0001-8349-9270

Earhart;Virus isolations and high population density implicate Culex antennatus (Becker) (Diptera: Culicidae) as a vector of Rift Valley Fever virus during an outbreak in the Nile Delta of Egypt;In June, 2003, Egypt's hospital-based electronic disease surveillance system began to record increased cases of acute febrile illness from governorates in the Nile Delta. In response to a request for assistance from the Egyptian Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) provided assistance in identifying the cause and extent of this outbreak. Testing of human clinical samples (n=375) from nine governorates in Egypt identified 29 cases of RVF viremia that spanned the period of June to October, and a particular focus of disease in Kafr el Sheikh governorate (7.7% RVF infection rate). Veterinary samples (n=101) collected during this time in Kafr el Sheikh and screened by immunoassay for RVFV-specific IgM identified probable recent infections in cattle (10.4%) and sheep (5%). Entomologic investigations that focused in rural, rice growing villages in the Sidi Salim District of Kafr el Sheikh during August-September, 2003, collected, identified, and tested host-seeking female mosquitoes for the presence of pathogenic viruses. Three isolates of RVF virus (RVFV) were obtained from 297 tested pools of female mosquitoes and all three RVFV isolates came from Cx. antennatus (Becker). While Cx. pipiens has been considered the primary vector of RVF virus in Egypt and is often the most common man-biting species found, Cx. antennatus was the dominant species captured at the 2003 outbreak location in Kafr el Sheikh governorate. This is the first time that Cx. antennatus has been found naturally infected with RVFV in Egypt.

However, limited surveillance takes place during interepidemic periods. Using serum samples obtained from asymptomatic persons across Kenya in 2000-2004, we assessed (by indirect immunofluorescent assay) prevalence of IgG against yellow fever virus (YFV), West Nile virus (WNV), tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), dengue virus serotypes 1-4 (DENV1-4), and chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Older persons on the Indian Ocean coast were more likely to be seropositive than children inland: YFV = 42% versus 6%,WNV = 29% versus 6%, TBEV = 16% versus 6%, DENV-1 = 63% versus 9%, DENV-2 = 67% versus 7%, DENV-3 = 55% versus 6%, DENV-4 = 44% versus 8%, and CHIKV = 37% versus 20%. Among inland samples, children in lowlands were more likely to be seropositive for CHIKV (42% versus 0%) than children in highlands. In Kenya, transmission of arboviral infection continues between known epidemics and remains common across the country.;WOS:000292433200028;;;;;;;;Jul;;;10.4269/ajtmh.2011.10-0203;;;;;;;;;;0002-9637;1;American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene;;;"Times Cited: 12; Weaver, Scott/D-6490-2011; Huang, Yan-Jang/D-9999-2015

D. LaBeaud, P. C. Cross, W. M. Getz, A. Glinka and C. H. King;Rift Valley Fever Virus Infection in African Buffalo (Syncerus caffer) Herds in Rural South Africa: Evidence of Interepidemic Transmission;Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging biodefense pathogen that poses significant threats to human and livestock health. To date, the interepidemic reservoirs of RVFV are not well defined. In a longitudinal survey of infectious diseases among African buffalo during 2000-2006, 550 buffalo were tested for antibodies against RVFV in 820 capture events in 302 georeferenced locations in Kruger National Park, South Africa. Overall, 115 buffalo (21%) were seropositive. Seroprevalence of RVFV was highest (32%) in the first study year, and decreased progressively in subsequent years, but had no detectable impact on survival. Nine (7%) of 126 resampled, initially seronegative animals sero-converted during periods outside any reported regional RVFV outbreaks. Seroconversions for RVFV were detected in significant temporal clusters during 2001-2003 and in 2004. These findings highlight the potential importance of wildlife as reservoirs for RVFV and interepidemic RVFV transmission in perpetuating regional RVFV transmission risk.;WOS:000289023600024;;;;;;;;Apr;;;10.4269/ajtmh.2011.10-0187;;;;;;;;;;0002-9637;4;American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene;;;"Times Cited: 24; Cross, Paul/K-6987-2012; King, Charles/; Getz, Wayne/I-4521-2013

Reynes;Prevalence of Rift Valley Fever Infection in Ruminants in Madagascar After the 2008 Outbreak;A Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak occurred in Madagascar from January to May 2008. The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the current and past circulation of RVF virus (RVFV) in livestock in Madagascar and (2) to evaluate the extent and magnitude of the 2008 RVF outbreak in livestock. The results of a country-wide serosurvey conducted in August 2008 on small and large ruminants are reported here. The study included 3437 cattle and 989 small ruminants (227 sheep and 762 goats) sampled in 30 of the 111 Malagasy districts, selected to be representative of the different ecozones and livestock density areas. Sera of animals were tested for the detection of immunoglobulins M (IgM) and G (IgG) against RVFV using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays kits. Recent infections (presence of IgM against RVFV) were detected in only 9 cattle (0.3% [0.1-0.4]) and 33 small ruminant (3.3% [2.2-4.5]) samples. Past infections (presence of IgG and absence of IgM against RVFV) were detected in 887 cattle (25.8% [24.3-27.3]) and 244 small ruminant (24.7% [22.0-27.4]) samples. Past infections were detected in all sampled sites. All ecozones were affected. In the southern and northwestern areas, the prevalence of cattle showing evidence of past infection with RVFV increased with the age of the animals. Our results suggest that there has been country-wide circulation of RVFV in 2008 in Madagascar, including in parts of the country where no clinical illness, either in animals or in humans, was reported. The data also suggest that the southern and northwestern areas may be endemic for RVFV, and that the virus may spread when ecological conditions are favorable for its amplification.;WOS:000289461600010;;;;;;;;Apr;;;10.1089/vbz.2009.0249;;;;;;;;;;1530-3667;4;Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 21; Reynes, Jean-Marc/M-6108-2014

The objective was to assess the potential need to develop a dual, recombinant PPR-RVF vaccine and how such a vaccine might be utilised in Tunisia. An overall PPR seroprevalence of 7.45% was determined, a finding supported by the high specificity (99.4%) and sensitivity (94.5%) of the ELISA used. On assessment of the diversity and density of mosquitoes in the sampling area, four species of RVF-vectors of the genus Aedes and Culex were identified. However, no serological evidence of RVF was found despite the use of a highly sensitive ELISA (99-100%). Larger scale investigations are underway to confirm these findings and the continuation of the emergency vaccination program against these two diseases remains valid. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Azhar;Serological survey of Rift Valley Fever among sacrifice animals in holy Mecca during pilgrimage season;The current research aimed to evaluate prevalence of RVF exposure among sacrifice animals during pilgrimage season in Saudi Arabia and to determine the vulnerability of the sacrifice herds based on its immune status. A total of 580 sacrifice animals including 120 local and 460 imported animals were randomly selected from the sacrifice herds at Al-Kaakiah slaughter houses, Mecca during the 2009 pilgrimage season. Blood samples were collected from all investigated animals for serum separation and conduction of capture and sandwich ELISA techniques for detection of anti-RVF virus IgM and IgG immunoglobulins, respectively. The study revealed an overall rate of recent RVF exposure, manifested by positive IgM sera, of 2.59% among investigated sacrifice animals (0.83% among local animals and 3.04% among imported ones). On the other hand, the overall herd rate of immunized animals based on the positive IgG cases were 47.06% (55% among local animals and 45% among imported ones). In spite of the low prevalence of recent RVF exposure among sacrifice animals, the low level of immunity among those animals increase the potential risk of eruption of another outbreak among sacrifice animals during pilgrimage with the subsequent socio-economic and public health consequences. The study clearly denotes the importance of applying an effective and controlled vaccination program for local animals and verification of the immune status of imported herds.;CABI:20113334740;;;;;;;;2011;;;;;;;;;;;;;1816-3319;4;International Journal of Tropical Medicine;;;"Times Cited: 2; 0

Methods: This is a descriptive cohort study summarizing the epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of ALKV infected patients diagnosed in Najran from 1 August 2003 through 31 December 2009. Results: A total of 148 suspected cases were reported, of which 78 (52.7%) cases were laboratory confirmed; 2 cases in 2003, 1 case in 2004, 4 cases in 2005, 1 case in 2007, 12 cases in 2008, and 58 cases in 2009. The cases were reported year round but 64.1% (50/78) of them occurred in the summer time. Twenty-five (32.1%) cases occurred as clusters in 5 families. The virus seemed to be transmitted from livestock animals to humans by direct contact with these animals and likely by mosquito bites.

In each study zone, horses were randomly selected and blood samples taken. A land-cover map of the five study areas was built using two satellite ETM+ images. Blood samples were screened by ELISA for anti-WNV IgM and IgG and positive samples were confirmed by seroneutralization. Environmental data were analysed using a principal components analysis. The overall IgG seroprevalence rate was 85% (n=367; 95% CI 0.81-0.89). The proximity to sea water, flooded banks and salted mudflats were identified as protective factors. These environmental components are unfavourable to the presence of Culex mosquitoes suggesting that in Senegal, the distribution of the vector species is more limiting for WNV transmission than for the hosts' distribution.";WOS:000282196000010;;;;;;;;Nov;;;10.1017/s095026881000035x;;;;;;;;;;0950-2688;11;Epidemiology and Infection;;;"Times Cited: 6; Gaidet, Niccolas/H-8122-2013

Male cases were more likely to die than females, Case Fatality Rate Ratio 1.8 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.3-3.8). Serosurveys suggested an attack rate up to 13% of residents in heavily affected areas. Genetic sequencing showed high homology among viruses from this and earlier RVF outbreaks. Case areas were more likely than non-case areas to have soil types that retain surface moisture. The outbreak had a devastatingly high case-fatality rate for hospitalized patients. However, there were up to 180,000 infected mildly ill or asymptomatic people within highly affected areas.

Human and animal infections were confirmed on the northern and southern coasts and in the central highlands. Analysis of partial sequences from RVFV strains showed that all were similar to the strains circulating in Kenya during 2006-2007. A national cross-sectional serologic survey among slaughterhouse workers at high risk showed that RVFV circulation during the 2008 outbreaks included all of the Malagasy regions and that the virus has circulated in at least 92 of Madagascar's 111 districts. To better predict and respond to RVF outbreaks in Madagascar, further epidemiologic studies are needed, such as RVFV complete genome analysis, ruminant movement mapping, and surveillance implementation.;WOS:000278164000008;;;;;;;;Jun;;;10.3201/eid1606.091266;;;;;;;;;;1080-6040;6;Emerging Infectious Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 54; Reynes, Jean-Marc/M-6108-2014

Adam;Rift Valley fever among febrile patients at New Halfa hospital, eastern Sudan;"Background: Since the first isolation of the Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) in 1930s, there have been several epizootics outbreaks in the tropic mainly in Africa including Sudan. Recognition of cases and diagnosis of RVF are critical for management and control of the disease. Aims: To investigate the seroprevalence and risk factors for seropostive to RVFV IgG among febrile patients. Methods: All febrile patients presented to New Halfa hospital in eastern Sudan during September through November 2007 were investigated to identify the cause of their fever including malaria and RFV. Results: Out of 290 feverish patients presented to the hospital, malaria was diagnosis in 94 individuals. Fevers of unknown origin were diagnosed in 149 patients. Seropostive to RVFV IgG was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 122 (81.8%) of the sera from these 149 patients with fever of unknown origin. While socio-demographic characteristics (age, Job, education and residency) were not associated with seropostive to RVFV IgG, male (OR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.0-7.6; P = 0.04) were at three times higher risk for seropostive to RVFV IgG. Conclusion: There was a high seropostive to RVFV IgG in this setting, more research is needed perhaps using other methods like PCR and IGM.";WOS:000278337500001;;;;;;;;13-May;;;10.1186/1743-422x-7-97;;;;;;;;;;1743-422X;;Virology Journal;;;"Times Cited: 6; 0

Animals-208 sheep and 84 goats ranging in age from 4 months to 15 years, from 2 breeding herds. Procedures-Blood specimens were collected from the sheep and goats during the 19992006 IEP in Rift Valley Province, and serum was harvested. Serum specimens were tested for IgG and IgM antibodies against RVFV by use of an ELISA. In addition, 7134 mosquitoes were trapped in Naivasha, Nairobi, and Northeastern Province, and speciation was performed. Results-No animals were seropositive for IgM against RVFV. Of the animals born after the 1997-1998 epizootic, 18% (34/188) of sheep were seropositive for IgG against RVFV, compared with 3% (2/75) of goats. Seventy percent (8,144/11,678) of the mosquitoes collected were of the Culex subgenera; 18% (2,102/11,678) were Aedes spp. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Detection of IgG in the sera of sheep and goats born after the 1997-1998 epizootic and before the 2006 epizootic indicated that virus activity existed during the IEP. Detection of Aedes mosquitoes, which are competent vectors of RVFV, suggested that a cryptic vector-to-vertebrate cycle may exist during IEPs.

A total of 598 serum samples were collected from sheep, goats, cattle and camel during the year 2007. Enzyme Linked Immuno-Sorbent Assay (ELISA) was used to detect the presence of anti-RVF IgG and IgM antibodies in sheep, goats and cattle sera. Camel sera were tested by isotype-nonspecific inhibition ELISA. Two out of 225 sheep sera were IgG, but not IgM, seropositive, other sera were IgG and IgM seronegative. In a single sentinel herd of 40 sheep, which was established in the oasis, no seroconversion was detected during the period from July 2005 to May 2008. The low intra-herd prevalence, the scattered distribution of the two seropositives, the absence anti-RVF IgM antibody and the absence of RVF-incidence in the sentinel herd, all suggest that the seropositive animals were introduced from outside of the oasis rather than infected inside the oasis. The prospective study shows that readiness of the region to RVF outbreak is possible.;WOS:000275982600009;;;;;;;;2010;;;;;;;;;;;;;1680-5593;2;Journal of Animal and Veterinary Advances;;;"Times Cited: 3; 0

Lancelot;Endemic Transmission of Rift Valley Fever in Senegal;P>Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an expanding zoonotic disease transmitted from ruminant to ruminant by Culicidae mosquitoes. In 2004, a longitudinal serological survey was performed on small ruminants in the Ferlo are (Senegal) to study RVF transmission and compared the results with those obtained from the same study in 2003. The results confirm that the disease is endemic and that the spatial transmission of RVF is highly heterogeneous. The virus could be maintained during dry season by transovarian transmission in Aedes vexans. Further studies are needed to improve the understanding of the epidemiological cycle of RVF in this region to implement adapted surveillance measures.;WOS:000271642700005;;;;;;;;Dec;;;10.1111/j.1865-1682.2009.01083.x;;;;;;;;;;1865-1674;10-Sep;Transboundary and Emerging Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 11; 1

Sera were tested for the presence of antibodies to RVF virus by the inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG). All reactive sera were further tested by the capture ELISA test and specific RVF immunoglobulin M (IgM) assay. Eight (4.0%) tested positive for IgG and none of the samples tested positive for IgM. Among the occupational groups examined, the seroprevalence was 7.3%, 1.5%, and 9.5% in the abattoir workers, livestock keepers, and others categories, respectively. Seropositivity was higher in men (5.3%) than women (1.5%) and increased markedly in men aged between 20 to 40 years, with no significant differences among the age groups and sexes. The results indicate that a small proportion of people in Tanga municipality were exposed to RVF virus infection prior to 2007 disease outbreak in Tanzania.

Youssef;The potential role of pigs in the enzootic cycle of rift valley Fever at alexandria governorate, egyp;This study was carried out to clarify the possible role of pigs as intermediate host for Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus through detection of antibodies to RVF in the sera of pigs and human contacts. Two hundreds and forty five of pig blood samples and forty three blood samples of human contacts to the pigs (Veterinarian and their assistants, butchers and Abattoir workers) were collected from pigs' abattoir at Alexandria governorate, Egypt. Blood samples were subjected to the detection of RVF antibodies by both ELISA and HAI techniques. The detection rate of RVF antibodies in pig sera by ELISA was 37 positive (15.1%) out of 245 tested sera samples. The highest detection rate of positive samples was in winter season (12 out of 58, (20.69%) and the lowest detection rate was at summer season (7 out of 70, (10.0%), while it was 9 (15.79%) and 9 (15.0%) positive out of 57 and 60 tested sera samples in spring and autumn seasons respectively with no significant differences between them. When HAI technique was applied to detect the RVF antibodies in pig sera, it gave only 20 positive samples out of 245 (8.16%) with highest detection rate was also in winter 7 (12.07%) while it was only 1 (1.43%) in summer season with significant differences between the results obtained in the summer season and those of autumn and winter seasons. History was taken from all of human contacts to exclude the possibilities of taking neither vaccination nor infection from other sources. The detection rates of antibodies against RVF virus in human contacts were 6 (13.95%) and 3 (6.98%) by ELISA and HAI techniques respectively.

Nichol;Multiple Virus Lineages Sharing Recent Common Ancestry Were Associated with a Large Rift Valley Fever Outbreak among Livestock in Kenya during 2006-2007;Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus historically has caused widespread and extensive outbreaks of severe human and livestock disease throughout Africa, Madagascar, and the Arabian Peninsula. Following unusually heavy rainfall during the late autumn of 2006, reports of human and animal illness consistent with RVF virus infection emerged across semiarid regions of the Garissa District of northeastern Kenya and southern Somalia. Following initial RVF virus laboratory confirmation, a high-throughput RVF diagnostic facility was established at the Kenyan Central Veterinary Laboratories in Kabete, Kenya, to support the real-time identification of infected livestock and to facilitate outbreak response and control activities. A total of 3,250 specimens from a variety of animal species, including domesticated livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, and camels) and wildlife collected from a total of 55 of 71 Kenyan administrative districts, were tested by molecular and serologic assays. Evidence of RVF infection was found in 9.2% of animals tested and across 23 districts of Kenya, reflecting the large number of affected livestock and the geographic extent of the outbreak. The complete S, M, and/or L genome segment sequence was obtained from a total of 31 RVF virus specimens spanning the entire known outbreak period (December-May) and geographic areas affected by RVF virus activity. Extensive genomic analyses demonstrated the concurrent circulation of multiple virus lineages, gene segment reassortment, and the common ancestry of the 2006/2007 outbreak viruses with those from the 1997-1998 east African RVF outbreak. Evidence of recent increases in genomic diversity and effective population size 2 to 4 years prior to the 2006-2007 outbreak also was found, indicating ongoing RVF virus activity and evolution during the interepizootic/epidemic period. These findings have implications for further studies of basic RVF virus ecology and the design of future surveillance/diagnostic activities, and they highlight the critical need for safe and effective vaccines and antiviral compounds to combat this significant veterinary and public health threat.;WOS:000260368000018;;;;;;;;15-Nov;;;10.1128/jvi.01519-08;;;;;;;;;;0022-538X;22;Journal of Virology;;;"Times Cited: 57; 1

The estimated incidence rate in chickens was 14% (95%, CI 7-29), with it very low level of transmission between July and September, and a transmission peak occurring between September and October. Comparing these results with the estimate obtained from a previous transversal serological study performed on horses the same year in the same area, the relevance of sentinel chickens in estimating the WNV transmission rate is highlighted. Conventionally adult mosquito populations disappear during the dry season but WN disease was shown to be endemic in the study area.

Davari and S. Chinikar;Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in Northeast of Iran;Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an arboviral zoonotic disease that is asymptomatic in infected animals, but a serious threat to humans. Humans become infected with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) either through bites of infected ticks, or by direct contact with virus contaminated tissues or blood of animals. CCHF now occurs sporadically throughout much of Africa, Asia, Europe and recent outbreaks of CCHF have occurred in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Since 1999, human clinical cases of CCHF have been reported from different parts of Iran. Although, most of human reports came from the Southeast of Iran, we analyzed samples from the Northeast provinces to check the geographical extension of CCHF. From October 2001 to the end of 2007, 10(15.9%) of 63 probable human patients confirmed to be infected with CCHFV using ELISA and RT-PCR tests in Khorasan region, Northeast of Iran, close to Afghanistan and Pakistan. No specific antibodies against other viral fevers such as Yellow fever, Rift Valley fever, Dengue 2 and Chikungunya were detected in the sera of these probable cases. During the years 2003 to 2005, of 448 livestock sera collected form different townships of this region, IgG antibodies were noted in 77.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 72.5-82%) of 298 sheep samples and 46% (95% CI: 38.1-54.0%) of 150 goat samples. The frequency of infection was more or less equal in both sexes and was age dependent. Regardless whether CCHF is newly enzootic or has long established enzooticity, the potential exists for sporadic or clustered outbreaks of CCHF in humans, so persons in close contact with animals and also health care workers should be alarmed.;WOS:000262560400025;;;;;;;;Mar;;;;;;;;;;;;;1680-5593;3;Journal of Animal and Veterinary Advances;;;"Times Cited: 1; ad, m/K-3654-2012

Genetic comparison of virion segments indicated little variation among the strains isolated. However, phylogenetic studies clearly demonstrated that these strains belonged to the East-Central African lineage for all segments. To our knowledge, this is the first time viruses of this lineage have been observed in an outbreak in West Africa.

Peters, E. M. Muchiri and C. H. King;Spectrum of rift valley fever virus transmission in Kenya: Insights from three distinct regions;Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an emerging pathogen that maintains high biodefense priority based on its threat to livestock, its ability to cause human hemorrhagic fever, and its potential for aerosol spread. To define the range of human transmission during inter-epidemic and epidemic periods in Kenya, we tested archived sera from defined populations (N = 1,263) for anti-RVFV IgG by ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization testing. RVFV seroprevalence was 10.8% overall and varied significantly by location, sex, and age. In NW Kenya, high seroprevalence among those born before 1980 indicates that an undetected epidemic may have occurred then. Seroconversion documented in highland areas suggests previously unsuspected inter-epidemic transmission. RVFV seroprevalence is strikingly high in certain Kenyan areas, suggesting endemic transmission patterns that may preclude accurate estimation of regional acute outbreak incidence. The extent of both epidemic and inter-epidemic RVFV transmission in Kenya is greater than previously documented.;WOS:000246326300003;;;;;;;;May;;;;;;;;;;;;;0002-9637;5;American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene;;;"Times Cited: 34; 0

Cagnolati, A. Mohamoud, G. Van Huylenbroeck and D. Berkvens;Screening for Rift Valley fever infection in northern Somalia: A GIS based survey method to overcome the lack of sampling frame;Following repeated import bans imposed by Saudi Arabia on livestock originated from Somalia due to suspicion of Rift Valley fever (RVF) presence and the severe socio-economic consequences of this, it was imperative for the Somaliland government to carry out surveillance activities in order to determine the status of transboundary diseases in its territory. A GIS computer software (Arcview((R))) was used to overcome the lack of lists of sampling sites due to the high mobility of pastoral nomadic herds in the study area. This method proved very convenient and flexible for the random selection of sampling sites and thus the compliance with the requirements by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) for statistically valid methods if the surveillance outcome is to meet international recognition and acceptance. Screening in Somaliland in 2001 and in Puntland in 2003 which targeted mainly sheep and goats aged 1-2 years (97% of surveyed animals) revealed no signs compatible with the disease but an overall sero-prevalence of 2 +/- 0.02% (90/4570) and 5 +/- 0.3% (206/4050), respectively. The spatial distribution showed clusters of high sero-prevalence located mostly in the Nugal Valley. This trend was confirmed by the follow-up survey implemented in Somaliland in 2004 with a herd prevalence of 80 +/- 6% and a within-herd prevalence up to 50% located again in the Nugal Valley. This result suggests the maintenance and increase of RVF virus activity in the valley. In addition conditions favourable to the breeding and survival of the vector population and the high density of livestock make the Nugal Valley an area of high risk for a RVF outbreak where sentinel herds will be placed.

The level of herd immunity was identified by detecting immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Rift Valley fever was diagnosed in, six out of eight districts included in the survey. Twenty-two animals from 17 herds tested positive for the presence of IgM antibodies against RVF in these districts. The infection rate ranged from 0.12% in the Sabya districtto 1.04% in the Jizan district. The level of herd immunity ranged from 22.2% in Jizan to 39.3% in the Alarda district. It can be concluded that the presence of IgM antibodies in clinically suspected herds suggests persistent RVF infection in the Jazan region. Thus, RVF control programmes should be continued to prevent the recurrence of outbreaks in the region and the possible further spread of infection to other regions of Saudi Arabia.;WOS:000244304200020;;;;;;;;Dec;;;;;;;;;;;;;0253-1933;3;Revue Scientifique Et Technique-Office International Des Epizooties;;;"Times Cited: 13; 0

Chevalier, R. Lancelot, Y. Thiongane, B. Sall, A. Diaite and B. Mondet;Rift valley fever in small ruminants, Senegal, 2003;During the 2003 rainy season, the clinical and serologic incidence of Rift Valley fever was assessed in small ruminant herds living around temporary ponds located in the semi-arid region of the Ferlo, Senegal. No outbreak was detected by the surveillance system. Serologic incidence was estimated at 2.9% (95% confidence interval 1.0-8.7) and occurred in 5 of 7 ponds with large variations in the observed incidence rate (0%-20.3%). The location of ponds in the Ferlo Valley and small ponds were correlated with higher serologic incidence (p = 0.0005 and p = 0.005, respectively). Rift Valley fever surveillance should be improved to allow early detection of virus activity. Ruminant vaccination programs should be prepared to confront the foreseeable higher risks for future epidemics of this disease.;WOS:000233076300006;;;;;;;;Nov;;;;;;;;;;;;;1080-6040;11;Emerging Infectious Diseases;;;"Times Cited: 9; 0

Gonzalez;Domestic transmission of Rift Valley Fever virus in Diawara (Senegal) in 1998;In 1998, circulation of the Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus was revealed in Diawara by detection of IgM antibodies in sheep and isolation of the virus from mosquitoes caught outside a village. A seroprevalence study was carried out. Finger-prick blood samples, individual and collective details were obtained. One thousand five hundred twenty people (6 months - 83 years) were included. Overall prevalence in this group was approximately 5.2%. The prevalence in infants (6 months-2 years) was 8.5%. Age, gender, contact with a pond, presence of sheep, and abortion among sheep, and individual or collective travel history were not statistically associated with prevalence. Prevalence increased significantly when the distance to a small ravine, located in the middle of the village, decreased. The results suggest a low, recent, not endemic circulation of the virus. Culex quinquefasciatus was captured near the ravine. This mosquito, similar to Culex pipiens, can play a similar role in human-to-human transmission of the RVF virus.;BCI:BCI200600350902;;;;;;;;Nov;;;;;;;;;;;;;0125-1562;6;Southeast Asian Journal of Tropical Medicine and Public Health;;;"Times Cited: 8; Gonzalez, Jean-Paul/0000-0003-3063-1770

Madani;Alkhumra virus infection, a new viral hemorrhagic fever in Saudi Arabia;Objectives. Four patients with typical acute viral hemorrhagic fever were identified in the holy city of Makkah, Saudi Arabia, between 8 and 23 February 2001, the Hajj (pilgrimage) period of that year. Tests for Rift Valley fever (RVF), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and dengue were negative. Blood specimens were sent to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta for viral culture and testing for other hemorrhagic fever viruses. A new flavivirus closely related to the tick-borne Kyasanur forest disease virus was isolated. This new flavivirus was originally isolated in 1995 from 6 patients with dengue-like hemorrhagic fever from Alkhumra district, south of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Methods. A case definition was formulated for surveillance of this new disease in Saudi Arabia. Blood specimens were collected from all patients with suspect 'Alkhumra' virus (ALKV) infection and tested for ALKV, RVF, CCHF, dengue, and West Nile encephalitis. Patients data were prospectively collected on standardized data collection forms. Results. From 8 February 2001 through 9 February 2003, a total of 37 cases were identified in Makkah, 20 of them were laboratory confirmed. Acute febrile flu-like illness with hepatitis (100%), hemorrhagic manifestations (55%), and encephalitis (20%) were the main clinical features. The case fatality was 25%. The disease seemed to be transmitted from sheep or goat to humans by the mosquito bites or direct contact with these animals. Conclusions. ALKV infection is a novel serious zoonotic hemorrhagic fever virus discovered in Saudi Arabia. The role of arthropods such as ticks and mosquitoes, and animals such as sheep, goat, and rodents in the transmission and maintenance of the virus remains to be elucidated.

The prevalence of RVF positive cases in Al-Zuhrah district, Hodiedah Governorate, at the time of RVF epidemic was 0.05% with a mean age of 37.8 years. Nearly 79.2% of the cases were working in close contact with animals. 60% of the cases had the onset of disease during 16-23 September. All the positive cases suffered fever and headache, and a high percentage of them suffered joint pain. Severe presentation appeared with higher percentages (41.6% for eye syndrome, 20.8% for haemorrahgic fever, and 18.75% for neurological manifestations). Most of the cases were completely cured (81.35%), only 12.4% had complications, and 6.25% died. RVF affected a few number of people, mainly those who were in close contact with infected animals and the clinical presentations were usually mild. But in Al-Zuhrah district, most cases appeared with severe presentation of the disease and this is may be attributed to several factors.;CABI:20063133424;;;;;;;;2005;;;;;;;;;;;;;1606-8947;3;University of Aden Journal of Natural and Applied Sciences;;;"Times Cited: 0; 0";;;597-607;;;Journal Article;;;;Pattern of positive Rift Valley Fever (RVF) cases during the epidemic period Sep.-Dec. 2000 in Al-Zuhrah District-Hodiedah Governorate- Yemen;;;;;;;<Go to ISI>://CABI:20063133424;9;2005;Paul.Gale;3;Rift Valley fever virus

Rijn;Vertical transmission of bluetongue virus serotype 8 virus in Dutch dairy herds in 2007;"In February 2008, evidence was found for transplacental infection of bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) in PCR negative, seropositive heifers in Northern Ireland originating from the Netherlands. The relevance of this route of transmission was studied in Dutch cow-calf combinations in the Netherlands of which the calves were born in the same time period of the year as the calves from the exported heifers, the first quarter of 2008. Blood samples were tested from 385 cows and their calves, housed in 43 dairy farms that became naturally infected with BTV-8 for the first time in 2007. All calves were at least 10 days old at the moment of first testing. In total 229 cows tested seropositive for BTV-8. Eight of these cows were still PCR positive. Out of the 229 seropositive cows, 37 calves (16.2%; 95% CI: 11.4-21.0) were tested PCR positive in the first sample taken in April 2008. In the first week of June, 34 out of the 37 PCR positive calves were still available for resampling. Three calves were still PCR positive; one was 5 months old, the other two were 3 months old. One month later, in the first week of July, all initially PCR positive calves, including the three still tested positive I month earlier, were PCR negative. We showed that BTV-8 can be vertically transmitted from cow to calf and can result in healthy looking viraemic calves remaining PCR positive for up to 5 months. These PCR positive calves could play a role in the epidemiology, and in particular in overwintering of BT. However, further investigations are needed to evaluate the importance of this route of transmission. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.";ISI:000275610200005;;"[Santman-Berends, I. M. G.

Vandenbussche;Transplacental infection and apparently immunotolerance induced by a wild-type bluetongue virus serotype 8 natural infection;Until recently, bluetongue (BT) virus (BTV) serotypes reportedly causing transplacental infections were all ascribed to the use of modified live virus strains. During the 2007 BT epidemic in Belgium, a significant increase in the incidence of abortions was reported. A study including 1348 foetuses, newborns and young animals with or without suspicion of BTV infection, was conducted to investigate the occurrence of natural transplacental infection caused by wild-type BTV-8 and to check the immunocompetence of newborns. BTV RNA was present in 41% and 18.5% of aborted foetuses from dams with or without suspected BTV involvement during pregnancy, respectively. The results of dam/calf pairs sampled before colostrum uptake provide evidence of almost 10% transplacental BTV infection in newborns. Apparently immunotolerant calves were found at a level of 2.4%. The current study concludes that the combined serological and real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) result of pregnant dams gives no indication of the infection status of the offspring except in the case of a double negative result. In a group of 109 calves with clinical suspicion of BT, born during the vector-free period, 11% were found to be RT-qPCR positive. The true prevalence was estimated to be 2.3%, indicating the extent of transplacental infection in a group of 733 calves of one to 4 months of age without BT suspicion. Moreover, virus isolation was successful for two newborn calves, emphasizing the need for restricting trade to BT-free regions of pregnant dams possibly infected during gestation, even if they are BTV RT-qPCR negative.;CABI:20083304490;;"Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre, Department of Virology, Brussels, Belgium.; kris.de.clercq@var.fgov.be";;;;;"Cab;";;;;10.1111/j.1865-1682.2008.01044.x;;;;;;;;;;1865-1674;8;Transboundary and Emerging Diseases;"LL821Prion, Viral, Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens of Animals (NEW March; 2000)

The spatial scan statistic and Moran's I statistic were used to determine clustering of surveillance data. The results show a high level of surveillance intensity for BT in Switzerland in 2007. In the region encompassing the Cantons of Aargau, Basel-Landschaft, Basel-Stadt and Solothurn, where cases were detected in 2007, the surveillance was significantly higher than in the rest of Switzerland. Six cases of Bluetongue were detected within the surveillance system. The prevalence estimates 9.62% (95% CI=3.25%-18.85%) versus 0.98% (95% CI=0.2%-2.22%) were also significantly higher in the area with higher surveillance intensity.

Blood samples from cattle submitted to the laboratory of the Dutch Animal Health Service for other voluntary and obligatory health programmes were tested serologically for BTV-8. in total, 37,073 samples were tested and 659 (1.78 per cent) were seropositive. The samples came from 5436 herds, of which 45 per cent of herds had only one sample submitted from them. The prevalence was highest in the south of the country, where the outbreak had started, and decreased towards the north. in 340 herds more than 50 per cent of cattle were tested, of which 156 herds were located in infected compartments, and in 37 of these herds (10.9 per cent) at least one positive cow was detected. The average within-herd prevalence in the 37 herds was 39.3 per cent: 2.2 per cent in I I dairy herds, 68.4 per cent in 20 small-scale herds and 14 per cent in four suckler cow herds.

Objective: To investigate the South American camelids' (SAC) susceptibility to BTV-8 infection, their role in the epidemiology of the disease, and the use of currently available serological screening tests in SAC in an endemic region. Animals: Three hundred and fifty-four unvaccinated and 27 vaccinated SAC (170 llamas, 201 alpacas), ranging in age from 1 month to 17 years between June and August 2008. The SAC originated from 44 herds throughout the country, representing 10% of the Swiss SAC population. Methods: Prospective, observational study of a convenience sample of SAC. Serum samples were analyzed with 2 serological screening tests. When results diverged, a 3rd ELISA was carried out for confirmation (ID Screen Bluetongue Competition ELISA kit). Results: All sera from the 354 unvaccinated animals were negative in the endemic region. Reliable seroconversion was observed after administration of 2 doses of vaccine. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: This study suggests a low susceptibility of SAC to BTV-8 despite the presence of the virus in the cattle and small ruminant population, indicating that SAC do not play a major role in the epidemiology of BTV-8. Furthermore, these results indicate that commercially available serological tests for BTV-8 can be used in SAC.;CABI:20103116426;;"Clinic for Ruminants, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Berne, P.O.

These systems made possible the detection of bluetongue reoccurrence.

Batten, M. Hofmann and B. Thur;Occurrence and spatial distribution of Toggenburg Orbivirus in Switzerland;Recently, a new member of the Bluetongue virus (BTV) serogroup named Toggenburg Orbivirus (TOV) in goats from Switzerland has been described. The epidemiology and host range of TOV are currently unknown. Since TOV causes cross-reactions in laboratory tests used for BTV diagnosis, this study was carried out in order to determine the spatial and temporal spread of TOV. Therefore, serum samples from a national survey in goats, collected during winter and spring 2008 in Switzerland, were serologically examined. Additionally, cattle and sheep from holdings with seropositive goats were tested for the presence of viral RNA and antibodies against BTV and TOV. All goat samples analysed within routine diagnostics at the Institute of Virology and Immunoprophylaxis from 2008 to 2009 were also tested for the presence of TOV. Finally, goat sera collected 1998 in the Canton of Ticino (TI) were analysed. Although the TOV index cases had been identified in flocks north of the Alps, no additional TOV-positive herds were found by serological testing in this region. In contrast, south of the Alps, i.e. in the Canton of Ticino (TI), an apparent seroprevalence of 49% in goats was found at animal and 60% at herd level. In the eastern and western part of the Swiss Alps 15.2% and 10% of tested goats were serologically positive, respectively. A within-herd prevalence of up to 100% was found in some of the positive flocks. The positive flocks in TI were mainly found in three of the five districts, but seropositive animals were identified in each district. Certain selected seropositive flocks were investigated virologically. By RT-qPCR and genome sequencing, the presence of TOV could be confirmed in all investigated seropositive flocks. By testing the goats within routine diagnostics, TOV genome was detected in one goat showing BT-like clinical symptoms from the central Alps and in three healthy animals imported from Germany. Although 3.8% of the sheep from flocks with TOV-positive goats or in contact with these animals showed a positive antibody reaction, TOV-specific RNA was not found in any of the tested sheep and also not in cattle from flocks with TOV-positive goats. Serological and virological test results from archived Swiss goat samples collected in 1998 indicated the presence of TOV already at that time, prior to any Bluetongue disease outbreak in this part of Europe. The results of this study demonstrate that TOV is widespread in certain parts of Switzerland and suggests that this virus has been present in the goat population for at least a decade, albeit without causing any disease signs.;CABI:20103320469;;"Institute of Virology and Immunoprophylaxis, Sensemattstrasse 293, CH-3147 Mittelhausern, Switzerland.; barbara.thuer@ivi.admin.ch";;;;;"CAB; WoS;";;;;10.1016/j.smallrumres.2010.05.016;;;;;;;;;;0921-4488;03-Feb;Small Ruminant Research;"LL821Prion, Viral, Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens of Animals (NEW March; 2000)

Intensified active surveillance in cattle and vector surveillance, prompted by the situation in northern Europe, preceded the detection. A vaccination campaign and intensive surveillance activities were initiated nationally, but with a focus on the southern part of the country. Measures included both active and passive surveillance by serology and PCR in ruminants, along with vector surveillance. The investigations revealed that the infection occurred over a large area of southern Sweden during September and October 2008, despite comparatively low vector activity, an apparently low viral load and no clinical disease. Transplacental infection was detected in one case.;CABI:20103235870;;"Department of Disease Control and Epidemiology, National Veterinary Institute, 75 189 Uppsala, Sweden.; susanna.lewerin@sva.se";;;;;"CAB; WoS;";;;;;;;;;;;;;;0042-4900;5;Veterinary Record;"HH600Host Resistance and Immunity; LL821Prion, Viral, Bacterial and

Santman-Berends, C. J. M. Bartels, G. v. Schaik, J. A. Stegeman and P. Vellema;The increase in seroprevalence of bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 8 infections and associated risk factors in Dutch dairy herds, in 2007;Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8) emerged in the Netherlands in August 2006 for the first time. In the winter of 2006/2007, during the transmission free period, the government decided to establish a sentinel network to monitor the re-emergence of BTV-8 in 2007. Between June and December 2007, a sentinel network of 275 dairy herds with 8901 seronegative cows at start, was in place for BTV-8 testing in milk samples. Besides estimates of the monthly BTV-8 within-herd prevalence per region (south, central and north), this sentinel was used to determine BTV-8 associated risk factors. Information on management and housing practices that were hypothesized to be related to the increase in BTV-8 prevalence (risk factors) were used. Complete information on BTV-8 testing and management was obtained for 234 herds. At herd level, the increase in seroprevalence was defined as the total increase in seroprevalence amongst sentinel cows per herd during the sampling period (in months) divided by the number of sampling months in which the spread of BTV-8 occurred within the particular compartment in which the herd was located. This parameter was used as dependent variable in the linear regression analysis. The final model revealed four risk factors remained in the final model. Herds in the central and southern region of the Netherlands had a higher monthly increase in seroprevalence 6.4% (95% CI: 3.1-9.9) and 10.1% (95% CI: 6.2-14.3), respectively compared to herds in the northern region. Furthermore, there was a strong association with grazing. The monthly increase in seroprevalence in cattle pastured a few hours per day or throughout the day was 5.6% (95% CI: 1.4-10.2) to 11.4% (95% CI: 6.0-17.3) higher, relative to that for cattle kept indoors. For cattle that grazed outdoors throughout the day and the night, the monthly increase in seroprevalence was 13.6% (95% CI: 7.2-20.8). In addition, an association was found between the monthly increase in seroprevalence and some factors relating to stable design. Keeping the stable doors closed during the day was linked to a higher seroprevalence rate compared to that in stables with the door left open (3.6% (95% CI: 0.3-7.1)). Furthermore, a horizontal ventilation opening (>30 cm) along the walls of the stable, and with a windbreak curtain, appeared to offer some protection (-3.0% per month (95% CI: -6.0 to 0.2)) as compared to stables that had no or, only a small, ventilation opening (<30 cm). By the second half of 2007, bluetongue had spread over throughout the Netherlands. Our study indicated that there were some management factors that may help limit exposure to BTV-8 and its consequences.;CABI:20103187552;;"Animal Health Service, P.O.

Cafiero, G. Ferrari, U. Santucci and V. Caporale;Health management of large transhumant animal populations and risk of bluetongue spread to disease-free areas;Transhumance, or seasonal grazing, in central Italy is a husbandry practice that is over two thousand years old. It involves the seasonal movement of sheep, goats and cattle from the southern lowlands of mainly the Puglia and Lazio regions, to summer pastures in the mountains of Abruzzo and Molise. Bluetongue (BT) made its appearance in Italy in 2000. In the early summer of 2001, disease was present in three regions: Sardinia, Sicily and Calabria. Neither an effective surveillance system nor a vaccination campaign had been implemented. Movement of ruminants to the disease-free regions of Abruzzo and Molise was therefore banned. The Italian Veterinary Services had to meet the challenge of the movement of ruminants from surveillance to disease-free zones, given the impossibility of stopping transhumance. The General Directorate of Veterinary Public Health, Food and Nutrition of the Ministry of Health developed a plan for both the Puglia and Abruzzo regions based on serological, virological and entomological surveillance. The plan was implemented between May and June 2001 when 7,000 animals moved from the Puglia surveillance zone to the infection-free summer pastures. In the early summer of 2002, eight regions were infected (Sardinia, Sicily, Calabria, Basilicata, Puglia, Campania, Lazio and Tuscany). Simultaneously, a nationwide surveillance system and a vaccination campaign, were implemented in infected regions. In the provinces where vaccination was compulsory, deviation from the animal movement ban was allowed if at least 80% of susceptible stock had been vaccinated. However, this objective was not achieved in the provinces of Rome and Viterbo (Lazio) where a large transhumant population was present and where sporadic virus circulation had been detected. A specific control plan to allow transhumance from Lazio to Abruzzo, Marche and Umbria was designed and implemented to increase the number of animals that could be moved. Between May and June 2002, authorisation was granted to move 28,000 head, whereas prohibition of movement was ordered for 12,000 sheep (belonging to 21 flocks). Regional authorities financed feeding, watering and housing for these animals. Transhumance did not spread infection to disease-free areas either in 2001 or in 2002.;20422619;;Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale dell'Abruzzo e del Molise G.

Clercq;Evaluation of antibody-ELISA and real-time RT-PCR for the diagnosis and profiling of bluetongue virus serotype 8 during the epidemic in Belgium in 2006;"In 2006 bluetongue (BT) emerged for the first time in North-Western Europe. Reliable diagnostic tools are essential in controlling BT but data on the diagnostic sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) are often missing. This paper aims to describe and analyse the results obtained with the diagnostics used in Belgium during the 2006 BT crisis. The diagnosis was based on a combination of antibody detection (competitive ELISA, cELISA) and viral RNA detection by real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). The performance of the cELISA as a diagnostic tool was assessed on field results obtained during the epidemic and previous surveillance campaigns. As the infectious status of the animals is unknown during an epidemic, a Bayesian analysis was performed. Both assays were found to be equally specific (RT-qPCR: 98.5%; cELISA: 98.2%) while the diagnostic sensitivity of the RT-qPCR (99.5%) was superior to that of the cELISA (87.8%). The assumption of RT-qPCR as standard of comparison during the bluetongue virus (BTV) epidemic proved valid based on the results of the Bayesian analysis. A ROC analysis of the cELISA, using RT-qPCR as standard of comparison, showed that the cut-off point with the highest accuracy occurred at a percentage negativity of 66, which is markedly higher than the cut-off proposed by the manufacturer. The analysis of the results was further extended to serological and molecular profiling and the possible use of profiling as a rapid epidemiological marker of the BTV in-field situation was assessed. A comparison of the serological profiles obtained before, during and at the end of the Belgian epidemic clearly showed the existence of an intermediate zone which appears soon after BTV (re)enters the population. The appearance or disappearance of this intermediate zone is correlated with virus circulation and provides valuable information, which would be entirely overlooked if only positive and negative results were considered.";CABI:20083136244;;"Veterinary and Agrochemical Research Centre, Department of Virology, Groeselenberg 99, B-1180 Brussels, Belgium.; frank.vandenbussche@var.fgov.be";;;;;"Cab;";;;;;;;;;;;;;;0378-1135;02-Jan;Veterinary Microbiology;"LL821Prion, Viral, Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens of Animals (NEW March; 2000)

Vanbinst, F. Vandenbussche, J. Hooyberghs, A. Aerts, K. D. Clercq and K. Mintiens;Establishing the spread of bluetongue virus at the end of the 2006 epidemic in Belgium;Bluetongue (BT) was notified for the first time in several Northern European countries in August 2006. The first reported outbreaks of BT were confirmed in herds located near the place where Belgium, The Netherlands and Germany share borders. The disease was rapidly and widely disseminated throughout Belgium in both sheep and cattle herds. During the epidemic, case reporting by the Veterinary Authorities relied almost exclusively on the identification of herds with confirmed clinical infected ruminants. A cross-sectional serological survey targeting all Belgian ruminants was then undertaken during the vector-free season. The first objective of this study was to provide unbiased estimates of BT-seroprevalence for different regions of Belgium. Since under-reporting was suspected during the epidemic, a second goal was to compare the final dispersion of the virus based on the seroprevalence estimates to the dispersion of the confirmed clinical cases which were notified in Belgium, in order to estimate the accuracy of the case detection based on clinical suspicion. True within-herd seroprevalence was estimated based on a logistic-normal regression model with prior specification on the diagnostic test's sensitivity and specificity. The model was fitted in a Bayesian framework. Herd seroprevalence was estimated using a logistic regression model. To study the linear correlation between the BT winter screening data and the case-herds data, the linear predicted values for the herd prevalence were compared and the Pearson correlation coefficient was estimated. The overall herd and true within-herd seroprevalences were estimated at 83.3 (79.2-87.0) and 23.8 (20.1-28.1)%, respectively. BT seropositivity was shown to be widely but unevenly distributed throughout Belgium, with a gradient decreasing towards the south and the west of the country. The analysis has shown there was a strong correlation between the outbreak data and the data from the survey (r = 0.73, p, < 0.0001). The case detection system based on clinical suspicion underestimated the real impact of the epidemic, but indicated an accurate spatial distribution of the virus at the end of the epidemic.

Zientara;The epidemiology and diagnosis of bluetongue with particular reference to Corsica;Bluetongue (BT) and/or BT viruses (BTV) have been identified in the Mediterranean basin and the Balkans each year from 1998 to 2002 and in particular BTV serotype 2 in the French Island of Corsica (2000 and 2001). In response to these virus incursions, the French Veterinary Authorities carried out epidemiological studies that included virological, serological and entomological analysis, and two vaccination campaigns performed in the winter of 2000/2001 and the winter and spring of 2001 and 2002. Rapid and reliable serotype differentiation is essential at the start of an outbreak to allow an early selection of vaccine to control the spread of the virus. Thus, molecular tools, that complement conventional methods, have been developed for early detection of infection, determination of the serotype, and differentiation between natural infection and vaccination. Serological results showed that the first vaccination campaign during the winter of 2000/2001 did not provide full protection for all sheep and during the summer of 2001, 335 sheep flocks in Corsica were again infected by BTV 2 (7-fold more that in 2000). Entomological studies have demonstrated that the only proven vector of the disease, Culicoides imicola, was present in the island in 2000 and that it has successfully established itself in Corsica. The safety and immunogenicity of the commercial South African vaccine were studied. Fourteen sheep were vaccinated and then observed for clinical signs. Blood, sera, spleen and lymph nodes were collected and analysed, and the results confirmed the safety and potency of using this vaccine to protect sheep from clinical disease. As a result, an intensive vaccination campaign was performed during winter and spring 2001/2002. No cases of BT had been observed by the end of summer 2002, indicating that the vaccination campaign has been successful in protecting sheep from infection.;CABI:20043106179;;"Agence Francaise de Securite Sanitaire des Aliments - U.M.R - APSSA - INRA - ENVA 1161 Alfort, 22, rue Pierre Curie, 94703 Maisons-Alfort, France.; e.breard@alfort.afssa.fr";;;;;"Cab;";;;;10.1016/j.rvsc.2003.08.004;;;;;;;;;;0034-5288;1;Research in Veterinary Science;"HH600Host Resistance and Immunity; LL821Prion, Viral, Bacterial and

While the origin of the virus remains unknown, the prevalence of infections in cattle was investigated in a virological (N=28,658) and serological (N=2075) field survey in Lower Saxony, where 45 cases confined to the district Grafschaft Bentheim were found. Blood from affected animals was used for the experimental infection of three cattle with different BTV antibody status, leading to sustained viraemia in one animal naive for BTV. Of two animals that had detectable antibodies against BTV serotype 8, one became transiently infected and seroconverted for BTV-6 while the other did not react. In conclusion, while only a very limited spread of BTV-6 could be observed in the field, experimental infection of cattle did not show substantial differences of the course of infection in comparison to other BTV serotypes.;CABI:20103214733;;"Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Sudufer 10, 17493 Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.; martin.beer@fli.bund.de";;;;;"CAB; WoS;";;;;;;;;;;;;;;0378-1135;04-Feb;Veterinary Microbiology;"LL821Prion, Viral, Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens of Animals (NEW March; 2000)

In-house serotype-specific RT-qPCR assays for bluetongue virus serotype 1 (BTV-1), -6 and -8 all gave negative results. Subsequent assays were carried out using conventional (gel-based) RT-PCR primers for all 25 BTV serotypes and only two primer sets, both specific for BTV-11, gave bands of the expected size. The cDNAs generated were sequenced and comparisons of the genome segment 2 sequence with that of the modified 'live' vaccine strain of BTV-11 from South Africa showed 100% identity. A survey of all ruminants in a 1-km area around the first positive farm using a BTV-11 serotype-specific RT-qPCR revealed five other holdings with in total nine BTV-11 positive animals. A cross-sectional monitoring of dairy cattle in Belgium showed an overall prevalence of 3.8% on herd level and 0.2% on animal level.

In 2000 there were no surveillance systems for bluetongue, but in 2003, active surveillance of the circulation of BTV and its vector Culicoides species, aided by a raised level of awareness in farmers and veterinarians, made it possible to study the introduction of BTV-4. The monitoring and analysis of the seroconversions of sentinel herds of goats, clinical signs and meteorological variables showed that the serotype had been present in the island since May that year, but clinical signs were first observed only in October. Moreover, the weather conditions and wind patterns were suitable for the transport of Culicoides species from Sardinia in May. These observations suggest that BTV had been transported on air currents from a southern infected area, and that it could have spread without causing clinical signs of disease for a few months.;CABI:20083036708;;CIRAD, TA A-16, Campus International de Baillarguet, F-34398 Montpellier Cedex 5, France.;;;;;"CAB; WoS;";;;;;;;;;;;;;;0042-4900;6;Veterinary Record;"LL821Prion, Viral, Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens of Animals (NEW March; 2000)

Rooij;A cross-sectional study to determine the seroprevalence of bluetongue virus serotype 8 in sheep and goats in 2006 and 2007 in the Netherlands;Background - In August 2006 a major epidemic of bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV8) started off in North-West Europe. In the course of 2007 it became evident that BTV8 had survived the winter in North-West Europe, re-emerged and spread exponentially. Recently, the European Union decided to start vaccination against BTV8. In order to improve the understanding of the epidemiological situation, it was necessary to execute a cross-sectional serological study at the end of the BT vector season. Cattle were the target species for cross-sectional serological studies in Europe at the end of 2006 and 2007. However, there was no information on the BTV8-seroprevalence in sheep and goats. Results - On the basis of our cross-sectional study, the estimated seroprevalence of BTV8-exposed locations in the Netherlands in 2006 was 0% for goats (95% confidence interval: 0-5.6%) and 7.0% for sheep (95% confidence interval: 3.5-12.9%). The estimated seroprevalence of BTV-8 exposed locations in 2007 was 47% for goats (95% confidence interval: 36-58%) and 70% for sheep (95% confidence interval: 63-76%). There was a wide range in within-location seroprevalence in locations with goats and sheep (1-100%). A gradient in seroprevalence was seen, with the highest level of seroprevalence in the southern Netherlands, the area where the epidemic started in 2006, and a decreasing seroprevalence when going in a northern direction. Conclusion - There is a much higher estimated seroprevalence of locations with goats exposed to BTV8 than can be inferred from the rather low number of reported clinical outbreaks in goats. This is probably due to the fact that clinical signs in infected goats are far less obvious than in sheep. The wide range in within-location seroprevalence observed means that the proportion of animals protected in 2008 by a natural infection in 2006 and/or 2007 can differ highly between flocks. This should be taken into account when vaccinating animals.;CABI:20083251686;;"Department of Virology, Central Veterinary Institute (CVI) of Wageningen UR, PO Box 65, 8200 AB, Lelystad, Netherlands.; armin.elbers@wur.nl; johan.popma@wur.nl; sandra.oosterwolde@wur.nl; piet.vanrijn@wur.nl; p.vellema@gddeventer.com; eugene.vanrooij@wur.nl";;;;;"Cab;";;;;;;;;;;;;;;1746-6148;33;BMC Veterinary Research;"LL821Prion, Viral, Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens of Animals (NEW March; 2000)

In total, 15 separate outbreaks of infection were identified, mostly as a result of clinical suspicions but also because of surveillance of bulk milk samples. These outbreaks led to extensions of the original vaccination zone planned for 2008. Blood samples from clinical suspects were analysed using ELISA and real-time RT-PCR assays for the presence of anti-BTV antibodies and viral RNA, respectively. A newly infected calf from the primary outbreak in 2008 was studied for a period of three months, during which time it seroconverted to BTV, but the presence of viral RNA in its blood was maintained throughout this time. Each outbreak was caused by BTV-8, as determined by a serotype-specific real-time RT-PCR assay. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of a portion of segment 2 of the viral RNA (encoding the outer capsid protein VP2) from the samples analysed was identical to the BTV-8 segment 2 that circulated in the Netherlands during 2006.;CABI:20103178042;;"Division of Virology, National Veterinary Institute, Technical University of Denmark, Lindholm, 4771 Kalvehave, Denmark.; aneb@vet.dtu.dk";;;;;"Cab;";;;;;;;;;;;;;;0042-4900;23;Veterinary Record;"HH600Host Resistance and Immunity; LL821Prion, Viral, Bacterial and

Baldet and E. Albina;Bluetongue control using vaccines: experience of the Mediterranean islands;Following the emergence of bluetongue (BT) virus serotype 2 on the island of Corsica in 2000, annual monovalent vaccination campaigns of the ovine population were conducted between 2001 and 2003. Despite vaccination, outbreaks were reported from several areas in 2001, but since November 2001, the absence of clinical cases in Corsica proves that vaccination is effective. This experience in Corsica is examined and, using available data, compared to the situation and the vaccination strategies on other Mediterranean islands. In light of the expansion of a new serotype of BTV onto these islands, a Mediterranean information network for BT and other emerging diseases is proposed.;CABI:20053118634;;;;;;;"Cab;";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"disease control; disease vectors

Bonilauri, P. Massi, P. Cordioli, C. Fallacara and A. Bovo;Autonomous circulation of serotype 2 of Bluetongue virus originating from vaccine in the province of Forli-Cesena;The presence of bluetongue virus is detected in Italy in 2000 and four serotypes (BTV2, BTV4, BTV9 and BTV16) are identified. In 2001, compulsary vaccination using live vaccines on cattle, sheep and goats was used to eradicate the disease. The animals are then free to move inside the country after vaccination. Epidemiological survey conducted in 2004 revealed 15 BTV2 seropositive cattle herds from the Forli-Cesena province due to vaccine strain BTVV-2. The serological survey carried out between 2004 and 2005 within the same area showed increase prevalence in cattle from 15-75% herd level and 2-21% at the individual animal level. The BTVV-2 strain circulation is confirmed in 2005 and the presence of the vaccine strain is due to the movement of vaccinated cattle in the mountainous area of Forli-Ceseno province. It is suggested that control programmes must be revised and a new surveillance programme for BTVV-2 active circulation should be made.;CABI:20073059727;;Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Lombardia e Emilia-Romagna, Brescia, Italy.;;;;;"Cab;";;;;;;;;;;;;;;1124-4593;3;Large Animal Review;"LL821Prion, Viral, Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens of Animals (NEW March; 2000)

Guis;Anatomy of bluetongue virus serotype 8 epizootic wave, France, 2007-2008;The introduction of bluetongue virus serotype 8 into northern Europe at the end of summer 2006 initiated one of the most widespread epizootics of bluetongue infection ever to occur. In winter 2007-2008, a cross-sectional serologic study was conducted in France along a transect perpendicular to the epizootic wave. Cattle herd-level seroprevalence varied from 4% to 100%, and animal-level seroprevalence from <1% to 40%. Only a low proportion of seropositive herds reported clinical cases in 2007. Sheep flocks were less frequently affected than cattle herds. The local occurrence of clinical cases and environmental indicators linked to forests were seropositivity risk factors, whereas the local density of cows had a protective effect. Overall results suggest that amplification of virus circulation in affected herds played a limited role in the epizootic wave diffusion and that bluetongue virus serotype 8 circulation in natural ecosystems could have played a substantial role in this progression.;CABI:20103366457;;"Agence Francaise de Securite Sanitaire des Aliment, Maisons-Alfort, France.; benoit.durand@anses.fr";;;;;"Cab;";;;;;;;;;;;;;;1080-6040;12;Emerging Infectious Diseases;"LL821Prion, Viral, Bacterial and Fungal Pathogens of Animals (NEW March; 2000)

Insights into the dynamics and scale of virus transmission can be obtained from estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0). We estimate R0 for ASF virus in small holder, free-range pig production system in Gulu, Uganda. The estimation was based on data collected from outbreaks that affected 43 villages (out of the 289 villages with an overall pig population of 26,570) between April 2010 and November 2011. A total of 211 outbreaks met the criteria for inclusion in the study. Three methods were used, specifically; (i) GIS- based identification of the nearest infectious neighbour based on the Euclidean distance between outbreaks, (ii) epidemic doubling time, and (iii) a compartmental susceptible-infectious (SI) model. For implementation of the SI model, three approaches were used namely; curve fitting (CF), a linear regression model (LRM) and the SI/N proportion. The R0 estimates from the nearest infectious neighbour and epidemic doubling time methods were 3.24 and 1.63 respectively. Estimates from the SI-based method were 1.58 for the CF approach, 1.90 for the LRM, and 1.77 for the SI/N proportion. Since all these values were above one, they predict the observed persistence of the virus in the population. We hypothesize that the observed variation in the estimates is a consequence of the data used. Higher resolution and temporally better defined data would likely reduce this variation.

RESULTS: To facilitate the serological investigation, sera were collected from 104 sheep in 2013 and 2014 and assayed by plaque reduction neutralization test using all six BUN serogroup viruses known to occur in the United States: Cache Valley virus (CVV), Lokern virus (LOKV), Main Drain virus (MDV), Northway virus, Potosi virus and Tensaw virus. BUN serogroup virus-specific antibodies were detected in 41 (39%) sheep. Of these, three were seropositive for MDV, one was seropositive for CVV, one was seropositive for LOKV and 36 had antibodies to an undetermined BUN serogroup virus. Additionally, 30,606 Culicoides sonorensis were collected in 2013 using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) light traps and assayed for cytopathic virus by virus isolation in African Green Monkey kidney (Vero) cells. All midges were negative. Almost one-third of the midges were further tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using BUN serogroup virus-reactive primers and all were negative.  CONCLUSIONS: We provide evidence of BUN serogroup virus infection in sheep but not C. sonorensis in Montana in 2013-2014. This study also provides the first evidence of CVV, MDV and LOKV activity in Montana.  ;;;;;;;pubmed;;2014;;;;;;;;;;;;;2052-6113;1;Veterinary record open;;;;;;;26392881;;;;;;;;;;Journal Article;;;;1;2014;sofie.dhollander;3;Main drain virus

Al-Majali;West Nile Virus Infection in Horses in Jordan: Clinical Cases, Seroprevalence and Risk Factors;"The objectives of this study are to report clinical WNV infection in horses and to determine the seroprevalence of and risk factors for WNV infection in horses in Jordan. In late summer and early fall of 2012, two mares were presented for evaluation of neurological signs. The first mare had hind-limb ataxia. The second mare was slightly depressed and lethargic. She had ataxia in her four limbs and cranial nerves deficits. Both horses were found positive for WNV IgM antibodies using commercial IgM-capture ELISA test. Both horses were treated symptomatically and recovered uneventfully. The occurrence of clinical cases initiated the need for a seroprevalence and risk factors study. Two hundred and fifty-three normal horses were randomly enrolled in the study. Enrolled horses were grouped into five major regions according to the geographical proximity and climatic similarities. From each region, around 50 horses were sampled. The serum collected from each horse was screened by a competitive ELISA, and those that reacted positive using the previous ELISA test were further tested using commercial IgM-capture ELISA test. Sixty-three horses (24.9%) of the 253 surveyed were seropositive to WNV. Of the 63 horses, none had IgM antibodies for WNV. The region with the highest prevalence was Jordan Valley and Balqa. Horses used for polo (OR = 9.77; 95% CI = 1.32-25.44) and horses located in Jordan Valley and Balqa region (OR = 13.31; 95% CI = 2.33-32.54) were identified as risk factors for seropositivity to WNV in Jordan. These risk factors were attributed to the hot and humid weather, which enhance vector availability. West Nile virus appears to be endemic in Jordan. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the virus situation in the country during the next few years in an attempt to control it.";WOS:000340537900001;;;;;;;;Aug;;;10.1111/tbed.12191;;;;;;;;;;1865-1674;;Transboundary and Emerging Diseases;;;Abutarbush, S.

A seroepidemiological survey of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever among cattle in North Kordufan state, Sudan Virology Journal, 10(#issue#),  (5 June 2013)-(5 June 2013); I. A. Adam, M. A. M. Mahmoud, I. E. Aradaib;A seroepidemiological survey of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever among cattle in North Kordufan state, Sudan;Background: Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), caused by CCHF virus (CCFV), may cause a fatal hemorrhagic illness in humans with mortality rate of approximately 30%. However, in animals the disease is typically asymptomatic and no clinical hemorrhagic infections appears to be associated with CCHFV. Recently, CCHF activity has been detected in western and southern Kordufan region, Sudan. Currently, no information is available in regard to previous exposure of livestock to CCHFV infection in the region. Aims: In the present study, a seroepidemiological survey was conducted to determine the prevalence of CCHF and to identify the potential risk factors associated with the disease among cattle in North Kordufan State, Sudan. Methods: In this survey, 299 blood samples were collected randomly from six localities in North Kordufan State and were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of CCHFV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Results: The result of the study indicated that the prevalence rate of CCHF was relatively high among cattle, where serological evidence of the infection was observed in 21 (7.0%) of 299 animals. Older cattle were eight times more likely to be infected with the virus (OR=8.0824, CI=1.174-66.317, p-value=0.034). Cross breeds were at 37 time higher at risk compared to endogenous breed (OR=37.06, CI=1.455-944, p-value=0.029). Highly tick-infested cattle are 6 times higher at risk for CCHF when compared to tick-free animals (OR=6.532, CI=1.042-10.852, p-value=0.030). Conclusion: It is recommended that surveillance of CCHF should be extended to include other ruminant animals and to study the distribution of ticks in the region to better predict and respond to CCHF outbreak in the State of North Kordufan, Sudan.;CABI:20133234582;;;;;;;;2013;;;;;;;;;;;;;1743-422x;;Virology Journal;;;Times Cited: 0;178;;(5 June 2013)-(5 June 2013);;;;;;;A seroepidemiological survey of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever among cattle in North Kordufan state, Sudan;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://CABI:20133234582;10;2013;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;Bluetongue virus

Estrada-Franco;Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus activity in the Gulf Coast region of Mexico, 2003-2010;Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) has been the causative agent for sporadic epidemics and equine epizootics throughout the Americas since the 1930s. In 1969, an outbreak of Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) spread rapidly from Guatemala and through the Gulf Coast region of Mexico, reaching Texas in 1971. Since this outbreak, there have been very few studies to determine the northward extent of endemic VEEV in this region. This study reports the findings of serologic surveillance in the Gulf Coast region of Mexico from 2003-2010. Phylogenetic analysis was also performed on viral isolates from this region to determine whether there have been substantial genetic changes in VEEV since the 1960s. Based on the findings of this study, the Gulf Coast lineage of subtype IE VEEV continues to actively circulate in this region of Mexico and appears to be responsible for infection of humans and animals throughout this region, including the northern State of Tamaulipas, which borders Texas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1935-2735 (Electronic) 1935-2727 (Linking);;PLoS Negl Trop Dis;;;Using Smart Source Parsing e1875. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0001875.

Four hundred and sixty-two dogs were involved in this study and divided in four groups according to their functional type: stray dogs, farm dogs, national guard dogs and pet dogs. The stray dog group showed the highest prevalence of leishmaniasis (11.7%), followed by the national guard dogs (9.7%) and the farm dogs (5.9%). IFAT was shown to be the most sensitive test in all groups. However. IFAT specificity was considerably lowered in the farm dog group: 65.2% versus 94.5% for the stray dogs. A considerable drop in PaGIA specificity was noted in the stray dogs group. The results of the current study demonstrate the variability of test characteristics in different situations and underline the danger of using standard values, without verifying their appropriateness for the specific purposes.

Bargaoui, S. Lecollinet, R. Lancelot;Mapping the Serological Prevalence Rate of West Nile fever in Equids, Tunisia;"West Nile fever (WNF) is a viral disease of wild birds transmitted by mosquitoes. Humans and equids can also be affected and suffer from meningoencephalitis. In Tunisia, two outbreaks of WNF occurred in humans in 1997 and 2003; sporadic cases were reported on several other years. Small-scale serological surveys revealed the presence of antibodies against WN virus (WNV) in equid sera. However, clinical cases were never reported in equids, although their population is abundant in Tunisia. This study was achieved to characterize the nationwide serological status of WNV in Tunisian equids. In total, 1189 sera were collected in 2009 during a cross-sectional survey. Sera were tested for IgG antibodies, using ELISA and microneutralization tests. The estimated overall seroprevalence rate was 28%, 95% confidence interval [22; 34]. The highest rates were observed (i) in the north-eastern governorates (Jendouba, 74%), (ii) on the eastern coast (Monastir, 64%) and (iii) in the lowlands of Chott El Jerid and Chott el Gharsa (Kebili, 58%; Tozeur, 52%). Environmental risk factors were assessed, including various indicators of wetlands, wild avifauna, night temperature and chlorophyllous activity (normalized difference vegetation index: NDVI). Multimodel inference showed that lower distance to ornithological sites and wetlands, lower night-time temperature, and higher NDVI in late spring and late fall were associated with higher serological prevalence rate. The model-predicted nationwide map of WNF seroprevalence rate in Tunisian equids highlighted different areas with high seroprevalence probability. These findings are discussed in the perspective of implementing a better WNF surveillance system in Tunisia. This system might rely on (i) a longitudinal survey of sentinel birds in high-risk areas and time periods for WNV transmission, (ii) investigations of bird die-offs and (iii) syndromic surveillance of equine meningoencephalitis.";WOS:000347332000007;;;;;;;;Feb;;;10.1111/tbed.12077;;;;;;;;;;1865-1674;;Transboundary and Emerging Diseases;;;Bargaoui, R.

Shapouri, M. Zeinvand;Aserological survey on antibodies against West Nile virus in horses of Khuzestan province;BACKGROUND: West Nile virus (WNV) is a vector-borne agent that is maintained within a bird-mosquito cycle. In humans and equids, infection by this agent is usually asymptomatic, or characterized by a mild febrile illness. However, fatal meningoencephalitis or encephalitis may occur. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of WNV infection and correlation of this organism with host and environmental determinants in horses in Khuzestan province. METHODS: In 2011-2012, serum samples of 155 horses were randomly collected from 7 zones of Khuzestan province and were examined by ELISA assay. RESULTS: Seroprevalence of WNV infection was 70.3% (95% CI: 63.1-77.5%). Statistical analysis showed that age, zone, presence of lake, type of bed, time of sampling, staying out of the stable after sunset and the method of insect control are significantly associated with infection (p<0.05) but sex, presence of river, wall condition, presence of rubbish dump and history of disease are not significantly associated with infection (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study confirm that the WNV infection exists in Khuzestan province. Considering the local weather conditions and the facility of vector-borne transmission, the health authorities should take measures to prevent and control the infection.;CABI:20143130187;;;;;;;;2013;;;;;;;;;;;;;2251-8894;;Iranian Journal of Veterinary Medicine;;;Times Cited: 0;3;;185-238;;;;;;;Aserological survey on antibodies against West Nile virus in horses of Khuzestan province;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://CABI:20143130187;7;2013;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;West Nile virus

BTV went undetected in Reunion Island between its first documented emergence in 1979 and two other serious outbreaks with both BTV-3 and EHDV-6 in 2003, and both EHDV-6 and BTV-2 in 2009. In these outbreaks, infected animals developed symptoms including hyperthermia, anorexia, congestion, prostration and nasal discharge. Samples were collected in 2011 to assess the prevalence of Bland EHD in ruminants native to Reunion Island by serological analysis. A cross-sectional study was undertaken on 67 farms, including a total of 276 cattle, 142 sheep and 71 goats. The prevalence rates of BT and EHD were 58% (95% CI [54.03-62.94]) and 38% (95% CI [33.85-42.63], respectively. Two further suspected outbreaks were confirmed to involve EHDV and BTV/EHDV. A new circulating EHDV serotype 1 of unknown origin was isolated. Our results confirm that the prevalence of both BT and EHD is high and that both are likely currently circulating. A high risk of BTV and EHDV infections was associated with the introdution of ruminants from neighbouring farms without quarantine, the presence of organic and other waste on the farm, and treatment against ectoparasites and insects.

BTV went undetected in Reunion Island between its first documented emergence in 1979 and two other serious outbreaks with both BTV-3 and EHDV-6 in 2003, and both EHDV-6 and BTV-2 in 2009. In these outbreaks, infected animals developed symptoms including hyperthermia, anorexia, congestion, prostration and nasal discharge. Samples were collected in 2011 to assess the prevalence of Bland EHD in ruminants native to Reunion Island by serological analysis.

The apparent prevalence of AHSV was found to be 46% in horses, 61.1% in mules and 36.4% in donkeys. The overall apparent seroprevalence of AHSV in three species of equine was found to be 46.2%. Statistically significant (p<0.05) difference in seroprevalence was observed at the different study areas confirming the existence of agro-ecology based variation in the occurrence of AHS. The highest seroprevalence of AHSV was documented at the mid highland followed by highland areas. There were no significant variations (P>0.05) among age groups and sexes for seroprevalence of AHSV. In this study, all age groups as well as male and female populations were equally affected by African horse sickness disease.

Coetzer;Serological Evidence of Rift Valley Fever Virus Circulation in Sheep and Goats in Zambezia Province, Mozambique;"Rift Valley fever (RVF) is endemic in most parts of Africa and has also been reported to occur in the Arabian Peninsula. It is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in livestock, but also in humans. During the last two decades several outbreaks of RVF have been reported in countries in Southern Africa. In contrast to other countries, no clinical disease has been reported in Mozambique during this period. In a serological study conducted in 2007 in five districts of Zambezia Province, Mozambique, of a total of 654 small ruminants sampled (277 sheep and 377 goats), 35.8% of sheep sera and 21.2% of goat sera were positive for RVF virus (RVFV) antibodies in a virus neutralization test (VN) and in an IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In 2010, a cross-sectional survey was conducted in 313 sheep and 449 goats in two districts of the same province. This study revealed an overall seropositivity rate of 9.2% in sheep and 11.6% in goat and an increased likelihood of being seropositive in older animals (OR=7.3; p<0.001) using an IgG ELISA. 29 out of 240 animals assessed for RVF specific IgM by ELISA were positive, suggesting recent exposure to RVFV. However, a longitudinal study carried out between September 2010 and April 2011 in a cohort of 125 of these animals (74 sheep and 51 goats) failed to demonstrate seroconversion. The results of the study indicate that RVFV circulates sub-clinically in domestic small ruminants in Zambezia Province.";WOS:000315644900029;e2065;;;;;;;Feb;;;10.1371/journal.pntd.0002065;;;;;;;;;;1935-2735;;Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases;;;Times Cited: 2;2;;;;;;;;;Serological Evidence of Rift Valley Fever Virus Circulation in Sheep and Goats in Zambezia Province, Mozambique;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000315644900029;7;2013;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;Rift Valley fever virus

Korva, Isuf Dedushaj, Tatjana Avsic-Zupanc;Prevalence of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Healthy Population, Livestock and Ticks in Kosovo;Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an acute, tick borne disease often associated with hemorrhagic presentations and high case fatality rate. Kosovo is a highly endemic area for CCHF, with a significant case fatality rate. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of CCHF in Kosovo. We tested 1105 serum samples from healthy population in both endemic and non-endemic areas in the country. Our results revealed a seroprevalence of 4.0% (range 0-9.3%) which is comparable to the seroprevalence in other countries. We show that seroprevalence is correlated to the disease incidence in each studied municipality. We also tested 401 animal sera (353 cow, 30 sheep, 10 goat and 8 chicken) in four endemic municipalities in Kosovo. We detected specific antibodies in all animals except in chicken. Seroprevalence in cows is comparable to other endemic areas and correlates to the seroprevalence in humans. No CCHF RNA could be detected in 105 tick samples obtained in 2012 and 2013. Sequencing of CCHFV positive ticks from 2001 revealed that the virus is most closely related to viral strains that were detected in CCHF patients from Kosovo. Results suggest that mild CCHF cases are most probably underdiagnosed and consequently that the burden of disease is higher than reported. Our study provides key information for CCHF surveillance and raises awareness for possible imported cases in CCHF non-endemic countries.;WOS:000347709300007;e110982;;;;;;;13-Nov;;;10.1371/journal.pone.0110982;;;;;;;;;;1932-6203;;PLoS ONE;;;Times Cited: 0;11;;;;;;;;;Prevalence of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus in Healthy Population, Livestock and Ticks in Kosovo;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000347709300007;9;2014;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus

Gallardo;Surveillance for African Swine Fever in Nigeria, 2006-2009;P>African swine fever (ASF) has had significant economic and social impact in Nigeria since 1997. However, there has been no effective national response to bring it under control. In this report, we confirm that ASF is still prevalent and widespread in Nigeria. Results from both serosurveillance and virological analyses indicated that ASF is present in most of the agro-ecological zones of the country. Nine per cent (9%) of serum samples and 48% of tissue samples were positive for ASF virus antibody and genome, respectively. Areas with high pig-related activities (marketing, consumption and farming) have higher prevalences compared with areas with less pig activities. Farm-gate buyers, marketing systems and transport of untested pigs within the country assist with the circulation of the virus. Only by putting in place a comprehensive routine surveillance and testing system, reorganizing the market and transportation systems for pigs, implementing on-farm bio-security protocols and considering the option of compensation will it be possible to achieve a significant reduction in ASF prevalence in Nigeria.;WOS:000279620600005;;;;;;;;Aug;;;10.1111/j.1865-1682.2010.01142.x;;;;;;;;;;1865-1674;;Transboundary and Emerging Diseases;;;Times Cited: 6;4;;244-253;;;;;;;Surveillance for African Swine Fever in Nigeria, 2006-2009;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000279620600005;57;2010;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;African swine fever virus

Napp, J. A. Jaen-Tellez, M. Fernandez-Morente, V. Fernandez-Molera, A. Arenas;Seroprevalence and risk factors associated to West Nile virus in horses from Andalusia, Southern Spain;"West Nile virus (WNV) is recognized as an emerging zoonotic pathogen, whose incidence in horses, humans and birds has increased significantly in different European countries in the last decade. A serosurvey study was carried out in non vaccinated horses to determine the geographical distribution of WNV in Andalusia (Southern Spain), and to assess the factors that influence the risk of WNV infection in horses. Antibodies to WNV were detected in 54 out of 510 horses analyzed by a blocking ELISA, of which 36 were confirmed by micro virus neutralization test (7.1%; CI95%: 4.9-9.3). A total of 28 out of the 348 equine herds (8.3%; CI95%: 5.4-11.2) had at least one seropositive animal. A generalized estimating equations model showed that the main risk factors associated to WNV seroprevalence were: number of horses within the holding (low), transport of the horse within the last six months (Yes) and presence of mosquitoes in the holding (Yes). The results demonstrated that WNV circulation in Andalusia was more widespread than previously reported. Besides, the distribution of WNV infections was not homogeneous as significant differences among provinces were observed. The results show the need to improve the active surveillance in Spain, so that the early detection of WNV circulation allows the establishment control measures such as vaccination and implementation of vector control programs during the risk period.

Ganter;Survey of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) infection in German goat flocks;Animal losses due to abortion and malformed offspring during the lambing period 2011/2012 amounted to 50% in ruminants in Europe. A new arthropod-borne virus, called Schmallenberg virus (SBV), was identified as the cause of these losses. Blood samples were obtained from 40 goat flocks and tested for antibodies against SBV by ELISA, with 95% being seropositive. The calculated intra-herd seroprevalence (median 36.7%, min-max 0-93.3%) was smaller than in cattle or sheep flocks. Only 25% of the farmers reported malformations in kids. Statistical analysis revealed a significantly lower risk of goats housed indoors all year-round to be infected by SBV than for goats kept outside day and night. The low intra-herd seroprevalence demonstrates that German goat flocks are still at risk of SBV infection. Therefore, they must be protected during the next lambing seasons by rescheduling the mating period, implementing indoor housing, and continuous treatment with repellents or vaccination.;WOS:000325222100011;;;;;;;;Nov;;;10.1017/s0950268813000290;;;;;;;;;;0950-2688;;Epidemiology and Infection;;;Times Cited: 2;11;;2335-2345;;;;;;;Survey of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) infection in German goat flocks;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000325222100011;141;2013;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;Schmallenberg virus

The Incidence of Japanese Encephalitis in Taiwan-A Population-Based Study Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases, 8(#issue#),  #Pages#; Li-Ching Hsu, Yu-Ju Chen, Feng-Kuang Hsu, Jyh-Hsiung Huang, Chi-Ming Chang, Pesus Chou, I. Feng Lin, Feng-Yee Chang;The Incidence of Japanese Encephalitis in Taiwan-A Population-Based Study;Background: A mass Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccination program targeting children was launched in Taiwan in 1968, and the number of pediatric JE cases substantially decreased thereafter. The aim of this study was to elucidate the long-term trend of JE incidence, and to investigate the age-specific seroprevalence of JE-neutralizing antibodies. Methodology/Principal Findings: A total of 2,948 laboratory-confirmed JE cases that occurred between 1966 and 2012 were analyzed using a mandatory notification system managed by the Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan. A total of 6,594 randomly-sampled serum specimens obtained in a nationwide population-based survey in 2002 were analyzed to estimate the seroprevalence of JE-neutralizing antibodies in the general population. The average annual JE incidence rate of the group aged 30 years and older was 0.167 cases per 100,000 people between 2001 and 2012, which was higher than the 0.052 cases per 100,000 people among those aged under 30 years. These seroepidemiological findings indicate that the cohort born between 1963 and 1975, who generally received two or three doses of the vaccine and were administered the last booster dose more than 20 years ago, exhibited the lowest positive rate of JE-neutralizing antibodies (54%). The highest and second highest antibody rates were observed, respectively, in the oldest unvaccinated cohort (86%) and in the youngest cohort born between 1981 and 1986, who received four doses 10-15 years ago (74%). Conclusion/Significance: Over the past decade, the main age group of the confirmed JE cases in Taiwan shifted from young children to adults over 30 years of age. People who were born between 1963 and 1975 exhibited the lowest seroprevalence of JE-neutralizing antibodies. Thus, the key issue for JE control in Taiwan is to reduce adult JE cases through a cost-effective analysis of various immunization strategies.;WOS:000340551500059;e3030;;;;;;;Jul;;;10.1371/journal.pntd.0003030;;;;;;;;;;1935-2735;;Plos Neglected Tropical Diseases;;;Times Cited: 0;7;;;;;;;;;The Incidence of Japanese Encephalitis in Taiwan-A Population-Based Study;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000340551500059;8;2014;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;Japanese encephalitis virus

METHODS: We investigated Akabane disease using serum neutralization tests in 446 blood samples collected from 187 cattle and 259 sheep of Xinjiang province, northwest China. RESULTS: (1) The overall prevalence rate of neutralizing antibody was 19.06 % (85/446), (2) the prevalence rates of Akabane disease in cattle and sheep were 20.32 % (38/187) and 18.15 % (47/259), respectively, (3) the disease prevalence rates were not significantly different between cattle and sheep, but significantly different among samples collected from different sampling months, (4) the disease was most prevalent in July when mosquitoes and culicoides were most active, and (5) the disease prevalence rates were significantly different between individuals with abortion experience and without abortion experience (P < 0.05), suggesting that Akabane virus infection may significantly increase abortion risk in cattle and sheep.

Aradaib;Prevalence of bluetongue virus antibodies and associated risk factors among cattle in East Darfur State, Western Sudan;Background: Bluetongue virus (BTV) is an insect-transmitted virus, which causes bluetongue disease (BT) in sheep and a fatal hemorrhagic infection in North American white-tailed deer. However, in cattle the disease is typically asymptomatic and no overt clinical signs of disease appear to be associated with BTV infection. Serological evidence and isolation of different BTV serotypes have been reported in Sudan, however, no information is currently available in regard to previous exposure of Sudanese livestock to BTV infection in East Darfur State, Sudan. Aims: To determine the prevalence of BTV antibodies and to identify the potential risk factors associated with BTV infection among cattle in East Darfur State, Sudan. Methods: A total of 224 blood samples were collected randomly from five localities in East Darfur State, Sudan. The serum samples were screened for detection of BTV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (c-ELISA). Results: Serological evidence of BTV infection was observed in 150 out of 224 animals accounting for a 67% prevalence rate among cattle in East Darfur State. Older cattle (>2 years of age) were six times more likely to be infected with BTV (OR=6.62, CI=2.87-15.26, p-value=0.01). Regarding animal source (contact with other herds) as a risk factor, it was shown that cattle purchased from market or introduced from other herds were 3 times at higher risk of being infected with BTV (OR=3.87, CI=1.07-13.87, p value=0.03). Exposure of cattle to the insect vector increased the risk of contracting BTV infection by six times compared to non-exposed cattle (OR=6.44, CI=1.53-27.08, p value=0.01). Conclusion: The present study indicated that age, animal source and the intensity of the insect vector are influential risk factors for BTV infection in cattle in the Darfur region. Surveillance for BTV infection should be extended to include other susceptible ruminants and to study the distribution of the insect vectors to better predict and respond to a possible BTV outbreak in the State of East Darfur, Sudan.;CABI:20143064454;;;;;;;;2014;;;;;;;;;;;;;2046-0481;;Irish Veterinary Journal;;;Times Cited: 0;4;;(7 February 2014)-(7 February 2014);;;;;;;Prevalence of bluetongue virus antibodies and associated risk factors among cattle in East Darfur State, Western Sudan;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://CABI:20143064454;67;2014;Edoardo.CARNESECCHI;3;Bluetongue virus

The survey revealed the presence of heartwater-exposed ruminants throughout the country, with local seroprevalence up to 100%. Seronegative, and therefore presumably susceptible, animals were also present in all regions, in some areas in numbers high enough to indicate local endemic instability. Overall seroprevalences in cattle, sheep and goats were 61, 51 and 28% respectively, and were generally higher in the northern part of the country and lower in the forest zone. Amongst animals over 1 year old, two thirds of cattle and sheep, and around one third of goats throughout the country had been exposed to E. ruminantium. In the north, seroprevalence in sheep sampled with and without cattle was similar, whereas in the south seroconversion rates in sheep were significantly higher in areas where cattle were present.

Evidence from mosquitoes, birds and blood donors demonstrated that the epidemic was caused by WNV lineage 2, which until recently was considered of low virulence. We conducted a household seroprevalence study to estimate the spread of infection in the population during the epidemic, ascertain the relationship of infection to clinical disease, and identify risk factors for infection. Methods: We used a two-stage cluster design to select a random sample of residents aged >= 18 years in the outbreak epicentre. We collected demographic, medical, and risk factor data using standard questionnaires and environmental checklists, and tested serum samples for presence of WNV IgG and IgM antibodies using ELISA. Results: Overall, 723 individuals participated in the study, and 644 blood samples were available. Weighted seropositivity for IgG antibodies was 5.8% (95% CI: 3.8-8.6; n=41). We estimated that about 1 in 130 (1: 141 to 1: 124) infected individuals developed WNV neuroinvasive disease, and approximately 18% had clinical manifestations attributable to their infection. Risk factors for infection reflected high exposure to mosquitoes; rural residents were particularly at risk (prevalence ratio: 8.2, 95% CI: 1.1-58.7). Discussion: This study adds to the evidence that WNV lineage 2 strains can cause significant illness, demonstrating ratios of infection to clinical disease similar to those found previously for WNV lineage 1.";WOS:000327308500138;e80432;;;;;;;Nov;;;10.1371/journal.pone.0080432;;;;;;;;;;1932-6203;;PLoS ONE;;;Ladbury, Georgia A.

We determined the prevalence of asymptomatic human infection with Leishmania infantum chagasi and associated environmental risks around Natal. Infection was detected by Leishmania skin test (LST) and anti-leishmanial antibodies in humans and anti-leishmanial antibodies in dogs. Amongst 345 humans, 24.6% were seropositive, and 38.6% were LST-positive. Prevalence of positive serology was similar in both sexes and across all ages. However, positive LST responses increased with age, suggesting that LST is long-lasting and cumulative.

Khafagi;Seroprevalence of bluetongue in sheep and goats in Egypt;Aim: The study was undertaken to understand the epidemiological status of bluetongue infection in Egypt. Materials and Methods: Serum samples were collected from clinically healthy as well as suspected sheep and goats. Samples were collected during the vector breeding season from September to November 2010, from 14 Egyptian governorates which represent different geographical regions of Egypt, and were tested by Agar Gel Immuno-precipitation Test (AGPT). Results: Out of total 1293 animal serum samples (sheep-1028 and goats-265), 17.5% of sheep and 14.7% of goats serum samples were found positive. The overall prevalence of anti-BT antibodies in different governorates was 16.9%. The highest prevalence of bluetongue group specific antibodies was detected in Beni-Suef, Giza, and Al Sharqia governorates (13.2%). The results indicate that there is a necessity to run further studies to identify the negative governorates. In addition, there is a lack in information regarding the BTV serotypes in Egypt. Conclusion: This study reflected high seroprevalence of bluetongue infection in sheep than goats. The results indicated that further studies are needed to identify the vectors from different agro-climatic zones, in addition, the BTV serotypes that are circulating in Egypt.;CABI:20143178214;;;;;;;;2014;;;10.14202/vetworld.2014.205-208;;;;;;;;;;0972-8988;;Veterinary World;;;Times Cited: 0;4;;205-208;;;;;;;Seroprevalence of bluetongue in sheep and goats in Egypt;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://CABI:20143178214;7;2014;Eliana.LIMA;3;Bluetongue virus

The present work evaluated the occurrence of seropositive equids for eastern encephalomyelitis virus (EEE), western encephalomyelitis virus (WEE), Venezuelan encephalomyelitis virus (VEE) and infectious anemia virus (IAV) in the Pantanal, Savannah and Amazon biomes of Mato Grosso State, Brazil. The detection of antibodies against IAV was carried out in 886 sera of equids by the immunodiffusion test, and antibodies against EEE, WEE and VEE were evaluated in 473 sera by the seroneutralization test performed in VERO cells. The results showed 46 IAV seropositive equids (5.1%). No sera was positive in the Amazon region, and the Pantanal biome showed a higher occurrence with 36.6% of seropositives (P < 0.05). No sera was positive for WEE virus and 168 (35.5%) and 31 (6.5%) equids were positive for EEE and VEE respectively. Higher frequencies (P < 0.05) were observed for EEE in the Pantanal and Amazon regions with 45.8% and 62.0% respectively. Regarding EEV, no differences were observed between the Pantanal, Savannah and Amazon regions, presenting 4.1%, 6.4% and 10.3% respectively (P > 0.05). Despite that IAV was not observed in equids from the Amazon, the occurrence of seropositive equids agree with the Brazilian prevalence. The differences of EEE and VEE behavior between biomes reinforce the presence of animal reservoirs, along with environmental and weather characteristics that support vector maintenance, which favor the presence of the viral infection in Mato Grosso State.;BCI:BCI201200661259;;;;;;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;0020-3653;;Arquivos do Instituto Biologico Sao Paulo;;;Times Cited: 0;2;;169-175;;;;;;;THE OCCURRENCE OF EQUIDS SEROPOSITIVE FOR ENCEPHALOMYELITIS AND INFECTIOUS ANEMIA VIRUS IN MATO GROSSO STATE, BRAZIL;;;Ocorrencia de equideos soropositivos para os virus das encefalomielites e anemia infecciosa no estado de mato grosso;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://BCI:BCI201200661259;79;2012;Eliana.LIMA;3;Eastern equine encephalitis virus

Caij, T. van den Berg, Y. van der Stede;Distribution of Schmallenberg Virus and Seroprevalence in Belgian Sheep and Goats;A serological survey to detect Schmallenberg virus (SBV)-specific antibodies by ELISA was organized in the Belgian sheep population to study the seroprevalence at the end of the epidemic. One thousand eighty-two sheep samples which were collected from 83 herds all over Belgium between November 2011 and April 2012 were tested. The overall within-herd seroprevalence and the intraclass correlation coefficient were estimated at 84.31% (95% CI: 84.19-84.43) and 0.34, respectively. The overall between-herd seroprevalence was 98.03% (95% CI: 97.86-98.18). A spatial cluster analysis identified a cluster of six farms with significantly lower within-herd seroprevalence in the south of Belgium compared with the rest of the population (P = 0.04). It was shown that seroprevalence was associated to flock density and that the latter explained the presence of the spatial cluster. Additionally, 142 goat samples from eight different herds were tested for SBV-specific antibodies. The within-herd seroprevalence in goats was estimated at 40.68% (95% CI: 23.57-60.4%). The results of the current study provided evidence that almost every Belgian sheep herd has been in contact with SBV during 2011 and should be taken into consideration as part of comprehensive SBV surveillance and control strategies.;WOS:000341101600005;;;;;;;;Oct;;;10.1111/tbed.12050;;;;;;;;;;1865-1674;;Transboundary and Emerging Diseases;;;Times Cited: 7;5;;425-431;;;;;;;Distribution of Schmallenberg Virus and Seroprevalence in Belgian Sheep and Goats;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000341101600005;61;2014;Eliana.LIMA;3;Schmallenberg virus

Two hundred seventy-four equids (189 horses, 43 mules, and 47 donkeys) with a history of non-vaccination for at least 2 years were selected randomly from the above areas. Sera samples were collected and assayed for the presence of specific antibody against African horse sickness virus using blocking ELISA. An overall seroprevalence of 89 (32.5%) was found and it was 24 (51.1%) for donkeys, 13 (30.2%) for mules, and 52(28.3%) for horses. Seroprevalence was significantly ( X2=11.05, P<0.05) different among the different species of equids.

Sera from pigs were assayed for African swine fever virus (ASFV) antibodies to determine the presence and prevalence of ASFV infection in 28 pig herds in Southwestern Nigeria from 2006 to 2007. A total of 374 pigs were screened in Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Osun and Oyo States, Nigeria using the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay method. Out of the 28 farms, 2 were negative (7.1%) for ASFV antibodies. Thirteen out of 15 small herds (86.7%) and 13 out of 13 (100%) medium and large farms were positive for ASFV antibodies. Seroprevalence ranged from 50% (Ondo), 52.5% (Oyo), 59.8% (Lagos), and 60.7% (Ogun) to 70% (Osun). Seroprevalence was higher within the older stocks - finishers, gilts, sows and boars (77.3%-96.8%) than in the younger stocks - piglets, weaners, and growers (13.8%-39.7%). Almost all breeder stocks became infected. The overall prevalence rate of 65.2% (244/374) and average prevalence rate of 56.8% per farm were indicative of widespread ASFV infection in pig population in Southwestern Nigeria. This study shows the persistence of ASFV since its re-introduction into Southwestern Nigeria in 1997. This highlights the need for improved hygiene and biosecurity measures on pig farms, and also calls for renewed collaboration between livestock and veterinary extension services providers to implement strategies for ASFV control in Southwestern Nigeria.;CABI:20103049500;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;978-80-7399-800-4;;Sustainable animal husbandry: prevention is better than cure, Volume 1.

Maan;Equine encephalosis virus: evidence for circulation beyond southern Africa;Prior to the recent outbreak of equine encephalosis in Israel in 2009, equine encephalosis virus (EEV) had only been isolated from equids in South Africa. In this study we show the first evidence for the circulation of EEV beyond South Africa in Ethiopia, Ghana and The Gambia, indicating that EEV is likely to be freely circulating and endemic in East and West Africa. Sequence analysis revealed that the EEV isolate circulating in The Gambia was closely related to an EEV isolate that was isolated from a horse from Israel during the EEV outbreak in 2009, indicating that the two viruses have a common ancestry. Interestingly horses in Morocco tested negative for EEV antibodies indicating that the Sahara desert may be acting as a geographical barrier to the spread to the virus to North African countries. This evidence for EEV circulation in countries in East and West Africa sheds light on how the virus may have reached Israel to cause the recent outbreak in 2009.;WOS:000309724500008;;;;;;;;Nov;;;10.1017/s0950268811002688;;;;;;;;;;0950-2688;;Epidemiology and Infection;;;Times Cited: 2;11;;1982-1986;;;;;;;Equine encephalosis virus: evidence for circulation beyond southern Africa;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000309724500008;140;2012;Eliana.LIMA;3;Equine encephalosis virus

Nkoghe, J. Paweska, E. Leroy;First serological evidence of West Nile virus in human rural populations of Gabon;To investigate West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in rural populations in Gabon, we undertook a large serological survey focusing on human rural populations, using two different ELISA assays. A sample was considered positive when it reacted in both tests. A total of 2320 villagers from 115 villages were interviewed and sampled. Surprisingly, the WNV-specific IgG prevalence was high overall (27.2%) and varied according to the ecosystem: 23.7% in forested regions, 21.8% in savanna, and 64.9% in the lakes region. The WNV-specific IgG prevalence rate was 30% in males and 24.6% in females, and increased with age. Although serological cross-reactions between flaviviruses are likely and may be frequent, these findings strongly suggest that WNV is widespread in Gabon. The difference in WNV prevalence among ecosystems suggests preferential circulation in the lakes region. The linear increase with age suggests continuous exposure of Gabonese populations to WNV. Further investigations are needed to determine the WNV cycle and transmission patterns in Gabon.;WOS:000279554900001;132;;;;;;;Jun;;;10.1186/1743-422x-7-132;;;;;;;;;;1743-422X;;Virology Journal;;;Pourrut, Xavier Nkoghe, Dieudonne Paweska, Janusz Leroy, Eric;;;;;;;;;;First serological evidence of West Nile virus in human rural populations of Gabon;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000279554900001;7;2010;Eliana.LIMA;3;West Nile virus

Robbin Lindsay, Antonia DiBernardo, Manisha A. Kulkarni, Nathalie Cote, Pascal Michel;Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus: High Seroprevalence in Horses from Southern Quebec, Canada, 2012;Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is a highly pathogenic arbovirus that infects humans, horses, and other animals. There has been a significant increase in EEEV activity in southeastern Canada since 2008. Few data are available regarding nonlethal EEEV infections in mammals, and consequently the distribution and pathogenicity spectrum of EEEV infections in these hosts is poorly understood. This cross-sectional study focuses on the evaluation of viral activity in southern Quebec's horses by seroprevalence estimation. A total of 196 horses, 18 months and older, which had never been vaccinated against EEEV and have never traveled outside Canada, were sampled from 92 barns distributed throughout three administrative regions of southern Quebec. Blood samples were taken from each horse and titrated for EEEV antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Equine population vaccination coverage was estimated by surveying horse owners and equine practitioners. PRNT results revealed an EEEV seroprevalence up to 8.7%, with 95% confidence limits ranging from 4.4% to 13.0%. Vaccination coverage was estimated to be at least 79%. Our study reveals for the first time in Canada a measure of EEEV seroprevalence in horses. High seroprevalence in unvaccinated animals challenges the perception that EEEV is a highly lethal pathogen in horses. Monitoring high-risk vector-borne infections such as EEEV in animal populations can be an important element of a public health surveillance strategy, population risk assessment and early detection of epidemics.;WOS:000325360300003;;;;;;;;01-Oct;;;10.1089/vbz.2012.1242;;;;;;;;;;1530-3667;;Vector-Borne and Zoonotic Diseases;;;;10;;712-718;;;;;;;Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus: High Seroprevalence in Horses from Southern Quebec, Canada, 2012;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000325360300003;13;2013;Eliana.LIMA;3;Eastern equine encephalitis virus

Microneutralization tests were performed using Vero cells. Ninety percent inhibition of the virus at a 1:10 serum dilution was considered positive for the presence of specific antibody. Sera having antibody to more than one virus were titrated from 1:10 to 1:640. The results indicated that 4-28% of the cattle per region had specific antibodies to CV virus. Neutralizing antibodies to NW, LK, and TS viruses were also detected, indicating possible exposure to these Bunyamwera serogroup viruses along with CV virus. Antibody titers measured against NW virus were very similar to those against CV virus. Antibodies to MD virus were present in low levels in bovine sera from Illinois, Maryland, and Ohio.

Infected dogs are the main reservoir for Leishmania infantum, and a potential sentinel for human VL in endemic areas. In the present study we investigated the prevalence of Leishmania DNA in dogs from Wenchuan, Heishui and Jiuzhaigou County in Sichuan Province, southwestern China, which are important endemic areas of zoonotic VL, detected by real time PCR. The results will help to design control strategies against visceral leishmaniasis in dogs and humans. Results: The overall prevalence of Leishmania DNA in dogs was 24.8% (78/314) in Sichuan Province, with the positive rate of 23.5% (23/98) in Wenchuan County, 28.2% (20/71) in Heishui County, and 24.1% (35/145) in Jiuzhaigou County, and no significant difference was observed among the three counties (P > 0.05). The dogs were further allocated to different groups based on sexes, ages and external clinical symptoms. The logistic regression analysis revealed that a higher prevalence was found in older and external symptomatic dogs, compared to that of younger and asymptomatic dogs (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The results revealed that L. infantum infection in dogs is widespread in Sichuan Province, southwestern China, which has a public health significance, due to its contribution to the transmission of the infection to humans by sandflies. It is necessary to take measures, including treatment or eradication of infected dogs, to control canine leishmaniasis, which could be helpful to reduce human VL in this area.;WOS:000295596300001;173;;;;;;;12-Sep;;;10.1186/1756-3305-4-173;;;;;;;;;;1756-3305;;Parasites & Vectors;;;Times Cited: 4;;;;;;;;;;The prevalence of canine Leishmania infantum infection in Sichuan Province, southwestern China detected by real time PCR;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000295596300001;4;2011;Eliana.LIMA;3;Leishmania infantum

The overall seroprevalence was 4.2%, with significant differences among prefectures, ranging from 0 to 27.5%. Multivariate analysis revealed that slaughtering and agricultural activities were significant risk factors for CCHFV seropositivity.

Since then, SBV has been continuously spreading over Europe, including Austria, where antibodies to SBV, as well as SBV genome, were first detected in autumn 2012. This study was performed to demonstrate the dynamics of SBV spread within Austria, after its probable first introduction in summer 2012. True seroprevalence estimates for cattle and small ruminates were calculated to demonstrate temporal and regional differences of infection. Furthermore, the probability of SBV genome detection in foetal tissues of aborted or stillborn cattle and small ruminants as well as in allantoic fluid samples from cows with early foetal losses was retrospectively assessed. SBV first reached Austria most likely in July-August 2012, as indicated by retrospective detection of SBV antibodies and SBV genome in archived samples. From August to October 2012, a rapid increase in seroprevalence to over 98% in cattle and a contemporaneous peak in the detection of SBV genome in foetal tissues and allantoic fluid samples was noted, indicating widespread acute infections. Notably, foetal malformations were absent in RT-qPCR positive foetuses at this time of the epidemic. SBV spread within Austrian cattle reached a plateau phase as early as October 2012, without significant regional differences in SBV seroprevalence (98.4-100%). Estimated true seroprevalences among small ruminates were comparatively lower than in cattle and regionally different (58.3-95.6% in October 2012), potentially indicating an eastward spread of the infection, as well as different infection dynamics between cattle and small ruminants. Additionally, the probability of SBV genome detection over time differed significantly between small ruminant and cattle samples subjected to RT-qPCR testing. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 480 serum samples were collected. Competitive ELISA test was employed to determine the presence of African Horse Sickness (AHS) antibodies. The seroprevalence of 28.63 and 14.23% were found in the Arsi and Bale zones, respectively. The apparent seroprevalence was found to be 24.60% in donkey, 20.34% in horses and 20% in mules. The overall seroprevalence of AHS virus was found to be 21.45%. There was no significant variation between the horse, donkey and mules in the seropositivity (p>0.05). Statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in the seroprevalence was observed in the different study area, confirming the existence of agro-ecology variation in the occurrence of AHS, thus higher seroprevalence of AHS was documented in midland (31.38%) followed by highland (15.06%). Significant variation was not observed in seroprevalence among age groups and sex of equine. All age groups as well as male and female of equine population were equally affected. Knowledge base of equine owner about AHS, Clucoides vector and mode of transmission of the disease in the study areas were assessed through structured questionnaire. The survey result indicated that almost all equine owners did not know about Clucoides vector and mode of transmission. Therefore, there should be awareness reaction about AHS and Clucoides vector among the people through an organized extension package to the present study areas.;CABI:20133045474;;;;;;;;2012;;;;;;;;;;;;;2041-2894;;International Journal of Animal and Veterinary Advances;;;Times Cited: 0;5;;326-332;;;;;;;Seroprevalence and associated risk factors of African Horse Sickness in Arsi and Bale zones, southeastern Ethiopia;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://CABI:20133045474;4;2012;Eliana.LIMA;3;African horse sickness virus

A total of 390 (191 mules and 199 donkeys) serum samples were collected from November, 2009 to February, 2010. Blocking ELISA was employed to determine the presence of African Horse Sickness Virus (AHSV) antibodies. The overall seroprevalence of AHS in this study was found to be 57.4% (95% CI = 52.35 to 62.39%). The prevalence of AHS was found to be lower in mules (55.5%) than donkeys (59.3%). Statistical analysis of the data showed that there were no significant variation (P>0.05) in the prevalence of AHS between the two species of animals examined in this study. The seroprevalence of the disease was higher in mules and donkeys >5 years old when compared to those <5 years old. But there was no significant variation (P>0.05). Males were found to be affected by AHS more than female animals do but there were no significant difference (P>0.05) between the two sexes of mules and donkeys examined. The result showed higher seroprevalence of AHS in lowland than the midland agro ecological zones of the study area. Analysis of the data showed statistically significant (P<0.05) variation of AHS between the two agro ecological zones. Of the 100 equine owners interviewed about AHS 25 (25%) were familiar and 75 individuals (75%) of the respondents know nothing regarding the disease AHS. Hence, the knowledge of equine owners about AHS was assessed to be at infancy. This suggests the need to implement strict awareness creation among equine owners on vaccination of their animals and methods of insect control in the study area in order to decrease the prevalence of AHS.;WOS:000307404900012;;;;;;;;23-May;;;10.5897/ajmr11.1475;;;;;;;;;;1996-0808;;African Journal of Microbiology Research;;;Times Cited: 0;19;;4146-4151;;;;;;;Seroprevalence and risk factors of African horse sickness in mules and donkeys in selected sites of West Amhara Region, Ethiopia;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000307404900012;6;2012;Eliana.LIMA;3;African horse sickness virus

We performed a cross-sectional study to estimate the seroprevalence of JEV in pigs and subsequently conducted a survey of farmers to identify risk factors associated with seropositivity. In July and August, 2010, 454 pig serum samples were collected and tested by competitive ELISA. Data from a 35-question survey of 109 pig owners were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. Seventy-six (16.7, 95% CI 13.620.4) pigs tested positive for anti-JEV antibodies, none of which had been vaccinated against JEV or sourced from JEV endemic areas. Risk factors associated with JEV seropositivity were summer abortion, wells as a water source, urban location, reported presence of mosquitoes and lower elevation. Our results suggest that JEV is likely circulating in the mountain districts of Nepal, and that locally acquired JEV should be considered a risk for residents and travellers in these areas.;WOS:000307727300004;;;;;;;;Sep;;;10.1111/j.1863-2378.2012.01456.x;;;;;;;;;;1863-1959;;Zoonoses and Public Health;;;Times Cited: 1;6;;393-400;;;;;;;Seroprevalence of Japanese Encephalitis Virus and Risk Factors Associated with Seropositivity in Pigs in Four Mountain Districts in Nepal;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://WOS:000307727300004;59;2012;Eliana.LIMA;3;Japanese encephalitis virus

Witteveen, G. van Schaik;Schmallenberg virus in Dutch dairy herds: Potential risk factors for high within-herd seroprevalence and malformations in calves, and its impact on productivity;"In November 2011, the new orthobunyavirus Schmallenberg virus (SBV) was identified in dairy cows that had induced fever, drop in milk production and diarrhoea in the Netherlands (Muskens et al., 2012. Tijdschrift voor Diergeneeskunde 137, 112-115) and a drop in milk production in cows in Northwestern Germany (Hoffmann et al., 2012. Emerging Infectious Diseases 18 (3), 469-472), in August/September 2011. This study aimed at quantifying risk factors for high within-herd prevalence of SBV and SBV-induced malformations in newborn calves in dairy herds in the Netherlands. Additionally, the within-herd impact of SBV infection on mortality rates and milk production was estimated. A case-control design was used, including 75 clinically affected case herds and 74 control herds. Control herds were selected based on absence of malformations in newborn calves and anomalies in reproductive performance. SBV-specific within-herd seroprevalences were estimated. Risk factors for high within-herd SBV seroprevalence (>50%) and the probability of malformed newborn calves in a herd were quantified. In addition, within-herd impact of SBV with regard to milk production and mortality was estimated. Animal-level seroprevalence was 84.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 70.8-92.3) in case herds and 75.8% (95% CI: 67.5-82.5) in control herds. Control herds that were completely free from SBV were not present in the study. Herds that were grazed in 2011 had an increased odds (OR 9.9; 95% CI: 2.4-41.2)) of a high seroprevalence (>50%) compared to herds that were kept indoors. Also, when grazing was applied in 2011, the odds of malformations in newborn calves tended to be 2.6 times higher compared to herds in which cattle were kept indoors. Incidence of malformations in newborn calves at herd level was associated with both within-herd seroprevalence and clinical expression of the disease in adult cattle. The rate of vertical transmission of SBV to the fetus once a dam gets infected seemed low. A total of 146 stillborn or malformed calves were submitted by 65 farmers during the study period, of which 19 were diagnosed as SBV-positive based on pathological investigation and/or RT-qPCR testing of brain tissue. Based on these results combined with calving data from these herds we roughly estimated that at least 0.5% of the calves born between February and September 2012 have been infected by SBV. A drop in milk production was observed between the end of August 2011 and the first half of September (week 35-36), indicating the acute phase of the epidemic. During a 4-week period in which SBV infection was expected to have occurred, the total loss in milk production in affected dairy herds was around 30-51 kg per cow. SBV had no or limited impact on mortality rates which was as expected given the relatively mild expression of SBV in adult cows and the low incidence of malformations in newborn calves.

No data are available regarding the prevalence of Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD). This study was conducted to assess the prevalence and to identify the circulating serotypes of these two Orbiviruses in this region (BTV and EHDV). Blood samples were collected in main livestock areas, from 122 young cattle between June and August 2011, to perform virological (PCR and viral isolation) and serological (ELISA) analyses. Moreover, samples from sheep and goat showing BTV-like clinical signs and from newly imported animals were analyzed using the same assays. Results confirmed an important viral circulation, with viro- and seroprevalence of 85% and 84% and 60% and 40% for BTV and EHDV, respectively. Ten Orbivirus serotypes were identified (BTV-1, 2, 6, 10, 12, 13, 17 and 24, EHDV-1 and 6). The circulation of many serotypes in intertropical America and in the Caribbean region underlines the need to establish measures to monitor and control animal movements. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

DNA was isolated from canine blood and screening PCR on the 666 bp fragment of 18S rRNA revealed that 108 (11.8%) of dogs were infected. Positive samples were confirmed by partial sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene. The consensus sequences, derived from various sequence data sets, were compared with sequences of 18S ssrRNA of Hepatozoon spp. available in GenBank. The alignments revealed 106 Hepatozoon canis and two Hepatozoon sp. sequences. Among H. canis isolates, we found a certain amount of heterogeneity, while both Hepatozoon sp. isolates were identical to the Spanish isolate (Accession No. AY600625) from Clethrionomys glareolus. On the basis of eight commonly mutated nucleotide positions in the partial 18S rRNA gene sequence, we divided the H. canis isolates into five groups. The results obtained indicate a higher prevalence and significance of hepatozoonosis in Croatia than previously believed and demonstrate that the organisms belonging to H. canis that infect European dogs are genetically very heterogeneous.;;;;;;;;;;;;http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2009.02.007;;;;;;;;;;0020-7519;;International Journal for Parasitology;Hepatozoon Dogs Molecular detection Sequence analysis Heterogeneity Isolate groups;;;10;;1129-1136;;;;;;;Molecular epizootiology of canine hepatozoonosis in Croatia;;;;JOUR;;;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020751909001015;39;2009;Eliana.LIMA;3;Hepatozoon canis

In this study, serological assay against AKAV and BEFV using virus neutralization assay was conducted using 1,743 bovine sera collected from Namwon, Miryang, Yeongju and Uljin which located in Southern part of Korea from March to May in 2012. The overall seropositive rates for AKAV and BEFV were found to be 49.8% and 1.2%, respectively. The regional distribution of seroprevalence for AKAV ranged from 18.1% to 63.7%. Seroprevalences of AKAV were 63.7% in Miryang, 62.3% in Uljin, 50.7% in Namwon, and 18.1% in Yeongju. The seropositive rates for AKAV in southern part of Korea were higher than the annual average at the national level. On the other hand, seropositive rates of BEFV in four regions were from 0.3 to 3.1%. In detail, regional seroprevalences were 3.1% in Miryang, 2.0% in Uljin, and 1.7% in Yeongju, and 0.3% in Namwon. Even only one year after massive outbreaks, overall seropositive rates were very low, similar to the annual average at the nation level. This result indicates that many number of cattle infected with BEFV may be replaced by new born calf or cattle in farm may not be immunized with vaccines. To prevent another epidemic, a national wide warning should be issued and more aggressive control measure must be implied. Recent global warming phenomenon could lead to more vigorous activity of haematophagous vectors and it is possible that arboviral diseases such as AKAV and BEFV are increased. Therefore, continuous sero-monitoring and extensive vaccination com-bined with control of haematophagous vectors are important to effectively prevent and control diseases caused by AKAV and BEFV.;KJD:ART001804077;;;;;;;;2013;;;;;;;;;;;;;1225-6552;;Korean Journal of Veterinary Service;;;Times Cited: 0;3;;151-155;;;;;;;The follow up study after massive outbreak of Akabane and bovine ephemeral fever viruses in Korea;;;;JOUR;;;<Go to ISI>://KJD:ART001804077;36;2013;Eliana.LIMA;3;Akabane virus

Al-Blowi;High seroprevalence of bluetongue virus antibodies in sheep, goats, cattle and camel in different districts of Saudi Arabia;Aim: To estimate the prevalence and distribution of serum antibodies to BTV in different domesticated animals in different localities of Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A total of 4845 field sera collected from different animal species within 10 districts in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were screened for the presence of group-specific BTV antibodies by competitive ELISA (c ELISA). Results: The overall BTV antibody prevalence was 54.1%, 53.3%, 44.8% and 25.7% in sheep, goat, cattle and camel respectively (at 95% confidence level). The Jizan and Eastern Province districts were the regions with the highest prevalence resulting 65.8% of sheep, 68.2% of goats, 49.3% of cattle, 44% of camel in Jizan and 65.8% of sheep, 62.5% of goats, 53.4% of cattle, 28.5% of camel in Eastern Province positive to c-ELISA. The second highest rate was in Najran district where the seropositivity for Bluetongue was found to be 60% of sheep, 57.9% of goats, 47.2% of cattle and 29.3% of camel. Our results recorded positive animals in all examined districts which indicate serological evidence of exposure to infection was widely distributed all over the country.

Campylobacteriosis was the most commonly reported zoonosis with an increase in confirmed human cases in the European Union (EU) since 2008. In food the occurrence of Campylobacter remained high in broiler meat. The decreasing EU trend for confirmed human salmonellosis cases since 2008 continued. More human Salmonella Enteritidis cases were reported whereas the S. Stanley cases remained, as in 2013, at a higher level compared with 2011â€“2012. Most MS met their Salmonella reduction targets for poultry but isolates of S. Infantis increased at EU level. In foodstuffs, the EU-level Salmonella non-compliance in fresh and processed poultry meat was rare and low, respectively. The numbers of human listeriosis cases further increased, since 2008. In ready-to-eat foods Listeria seldom exceeded the EU food safety limit. The decreasing EU trend for confirmed yersiniosis cases since 2008 continued. Positive findings for Yersinia were mainly reported in pig meat and products thereof. The number of confirmed verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) infections in humans slightly decreased compared with 2013. VTEC was reported from food and animals. A total of 5,251 food-borne outbreaks, including water-borne outbreaks, were reported. Most food-borne outbreaks were caused by viruses, followed by Salmonella, bacterial toxins and Campylobacter and with unknown causative agent in 29.1% of all outbreaks. Important food vehicles in strong-evidence food-borne outbreaks were â€˜eggs and egg productsâ€™, followed by â€˜mixed foodâ€™ and â€˜crustaceans, shellfish, molluscs and products thereofâ€™.

In the present study evaluation of blood samples collected from 225 dogs presented at Small Animal Clinics, GADVASU, Ludhiana, Punjab (India) was done for the presence of H. canis by PCR based assay targeting a portion of 18S rRNA gene. Of the total samples subjected to PCR, an amplicon of 666 bp was detected in 13.78% samples whereas, routine blood smear examination revealed gamonts in 5.78% samples. Furthermore, prevalence of H. canis infection was found to be significantly associated with season, being highest in summer and lowest in winter while other risk factors e.g. age, sex and breed showed non-significant association. In terms of various clinico-pathological parameters, significant drop in haemoglobin, total red blood cell count, packed cell volume and lymphocytes were recorded in positive cases whereas the total white blood cell count was non-significantly increased. The haematological alterations in the positive cases were lymphopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, relative neutrophilia, neutrophilic leucocytosis, eosinophilia, monocytosis and lymphocytosis while the biochemical profile revealed hypoproteinemia and increased levels of blood urea nitrogen and creatinine (in positive cases) pointing towards renal failure.

Aroch, R. Ofri, G. Baneth;Concurrent epistaxis, retinal bleeding and hypercoagulability in dog with visceral leishmaniosis;Canine visceral leishmaniosis (CVL) caused by Leishmania infantum is a common endemic zoonotic disease in the Middle East, including Israel. The common clinical signs, include, among others, ocular lesions and epistaxis. This report describes a case of CVL in a Boxer dog, which was presented to the hospital due to severe epistaxis, retinal hemorrhage, detachment and uveitis. The platelet count and platelet-crit were increased, and the clotting times were normal. Thromboelastometry demonstrated marked hypercoagulability. The bleeding tendency in this dog was therefore present concurrently with a hypercoagulable state and was likely a result of vasculitis secondary to circulating immune complex (CIC) deposition, which probably interfered with the platelet-vascular endothelium interactions. The dog improved with systemic prednisone and allopurinol therapy, as well as topical ophthalmic treatment. No bleeding episodes were noted from the time treatment was initiated. Nevertheless, the dog remained hypercoagulable during the follow-up period. Epistaxis and retinal hemorrhages in dogs with CVL may result from platelet dysfunction and thrombocytopenia, as previously reported. Nevertheless, based on the present findings, we suggest that in a subset of such cases, when thrombocytopenia is absent and hypercoagulability is demonstrated, bleeding may occur secondary to vasculitis. Thromboelastomety is therefore indicated in dogs with CVL, even in cases showing a bleeding tendency. Â© 2017, Israel Veterinary Medical Association.

Methods: This study was a prospective serological cross-sectional survey. Management data were obtained for 242 dogs by interview with their owners. Blood samples were collected from 237 dogs and screened for the canine vector-borne diseases using point-of-care qualitative ELISA assays. Anaplasma spp. positive samples were screened by PCR and sequenced for species identification. Rectal faecal samples were collected from 204 dogs for faecal flotation and immunofluorescent antibody tests were performed for Giardia and Cryptosporidium spp. on a subset of 93 faecal samples. The skin and coat of 221 dogs were examined for presence of ectoparasites. Results: The D. immitis antigen was detected in 46.8% (111/237) of dogs. Seroprevalence of Anaplasma spp. was 8.4% (20/237); A. platys was confirmed by PCR. Prevalence of hookworm was 92.6% (185/205) and Giardia was 29.0% (27/93). Ectoparasites were detected on 210/221 (95.0%) of dogs examined and 228/242 dogs (94.2%) had previously never received any preventative medication. Conclusions: There was a very high prevalence of D. immitis, hookworm and external parasites in Samoan dogs, and prophylactic medication is rarely administered. This is the first report confirming A. platys in Samoa and the South Pacific islands. The public health implications of poor management of the dogs should be considered and investigated further.

Scott, D. Mathur, A.J. Berens, C.A. Petersen;Leishmania incidence and prevalence in U.S. hunting hounds maintained via vertical transmission;Leishmania is the causative agent of leishmaniasis, a deadly protozoan disease which affects over 1 million people each year. Autochthonous cases of canine leishmaniasis are generally associated with tropical and subtropical climatic zones. However, in 1999, U.S. hunting dogs were found to have leishmaniasis with no history of travel outside the country. Transmission of this disease was found to be primarily vertical. In endemic areas, dogs are a dominant domestic reservoir host for Leishmania infantum. This study evaluated L. infantum infection prevalence and incidence within US dogs tested over a nine-year span (2007â€“2015). This investigation used both passive and active surveillance, following an initial outbreak investigation by the Centers for Disease Control. L. infantum infection incidence and prevalence over time and across regions were examined to evaluate whether transmission was sufficient to maintain ongoing infection within this population. These studies also established whether this disease is becoming more or less prominent within this reservoir host, dogs. There was no significant difference between prevalence and incidence rates via as measured by passive vs. active surveillance. Although due to fluctuations in sample submission there were significant changes in both incidence and prevalence of L. infantum in US hunting dogs over this nine year span, these differences were not outside of the interquartile range and therefore there is likely to be a steady-state of transmission within U.S. dogs. Based on these findings, if vertical transmission is the primary means of L. infantum spread in U.S. dogs, with appropriate husbandry and infection control procedures, elimination of L. infantum from US dogs could be possible.

In the context of a high fatality rate, identifying risk factors for in-hospital mortality in children treated for ZVL is of major epidemiological importance.

Forty-seven per cent (47%) were children under 18 months of age, and with a male / female ratio of 1.01:1. Results The overall case-fatality was 6% (n = 14). The risk factors for in-hospital death identified by a multivariate analysis were: bleeding at admission (OR = 25.5, 95% CI: 2.26â€“287.4; p = 0.009), white cell count less than 4000/mm3 (OR = 5.66, 95% CI: 1.16â€“27.6; p = 0.032), cytolysis (OR = 28.13, 95% CI: 4.55â€“173.6; p &lt; 0.001), and delay between onset of symptoms and admission 15 days (OR = 11, 95% CI: 1.68â€“72; p = 0.012). Conclusion The results strongly suggest that paediatric patients admitted 15 days after onset of symptoms, with bleeding, white cell counts below 4,000/mm3, and cytolysis at admission should be considered severe cases and subsequently, they are at high risk of mortality. A better understanding of factors associated with death of children from ZVL may contribute to decrease mortality. Â© 2017 Ben Helel et al.

Bisetto;More than the eyes can see: The worrying scenario of canine leishmaniasis in the Brazilian side of the triple border;A cross-sectional epidemiological study in the extreme-west of the state of ParanÃ¡ was carried out to access the prevalence, distribution, and risk variables of canine Visceral Leishmaniases (cVL). This study was conducted in three areas, two cities of far west of Parana state: Foz do IguaÃ§u (FI) and Santa Terezinha de Itaipu (STI), and along two transects between these two municipalities. To sample the entire urban area, the cities (FI and STI) were divided into a grid of squares of 400 m2 (patch). Among the 526 patches, 123 in FI, 40 in the transects and 33 in STI were selected according to the 'worst scenario' criterion. In the transect areas, in each 0.86 km five dogs from houses were surveyed to leishmaniasis. In each patch, blood of five dogs from houses (and from neighborhood when necessary) in the areas that seemed to be the most appropriate for the proliferation of vector were surveyed. The infection of the dogs by cVL were assessed using two serological tests were used (cELISA and TR-DPPÂ®), and, for those seropositive for both methods, the PCR method were used. Moreover, dogs presenting clinical signs or cutaneous lesions were sampled to PCR. The identification of Leishmania species was confirmed using PCR-RFLP followed by DNA sequencing. Micro, meso and macro scale environmental variables were also surveyed and statistically analyzed. The prevalence rate Leishmania infantum was 23.8% in FI, 4.7% in STI and 9.1% in the transects areas. Among the extrinsic variables analysed, the number of vectors and the presence of infected dogs in neighbouring were positively correlated with the occurrence of infected dogs. Dog size was positively correlated with cVL infection, while the quality of the dog's nutrition affected cVL negatively. As for cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), the first registry of dogs infected with L. braziliensis in the region shows that there is potential for transmission in peri-urban areas, since environmental conditions allow the proliferation of vectors capable of transmitting this species of parasite. cVL is widely spread in FI, with high prevalence. This supports the hypothesis that the parasite has been present in the region for longer than previously believed, despite the fact that the presence of leishmaniais in the region has only been recognized recently. It is important to control the population of dogs infected with L. infantum (parasite and non-antibodies) to prevent the spread of the disease to other dogs and also to people in the region.

Afonso;First molecular detection of Leishmania infantum in Sergentomyia minuta (Diptera, Psychodidae) in Alentejo, southern Portugal;Protozoan parasites, such as Leishmania spp., are the causative agents of many insect-borne infectious diseases with medical and veterinary importance. Leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania spp., is transmitted by female phlebotomine sand flies. In the Alentejo region of Portugal, located at the north of Algarve, cases of human and canine leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum have been notified. However, no recent studies regarding the sand fly fauna in the region are available. We therefore aimed to explore the phlebotomine sand fly species found in both, Ã‰vora and Beja Districts, to gain an insight about the leishmaniasis epidemiology in these areas. After the identification of the insect species, PCR molecular tests were used to assess L. infantum infection rate in the sand fly captured females, together with the analysis of blood meal sources of the insect vectors. One Sergentomyia minuta female was positive for L. infantum infection and another for human blood as a meal source. The occurrence of this phlebotomine species infected with L. infantum may suggest that, in the Mediterranean basin, leishmaniasis epidemiology is changing. Also, if the importance of S. minuta for the zoonotic and anthroponotic cycle of leishmaniasis is later proven, the strategies to control its vector will inevitably to be rethought.

Xuan;A PCR survey of vector-borne pathogens in different dog populations from Turkey;In the present study, a total of 192 blood samples were collected from pet dogs, kennel dogs and shepherd dogs in Konya district, Turkey, and tested by specific PCR for the presence of vector-borne pathogens. Several pathogens were identified, most of which can cause substantial morbidity in dogs. PCR results revealed that 54 (28.1%) dogs were infected with one or more pathogens. Positive results were obtained for Babesia spp. in 4 dogs (2.1%), Hepatozoon spp. in 8 dogs (4.2%) and Mycoplasma spp. in 46 dogs (24%). Three dogs (1.6%) were infected with two or three pathogens. The sequence analysis of the positive DNA samples revealed the presence of Babesia canis vogeli, Hepatozoon canis, Hepatozoon sp. MF, Mycoplasma haemocanis and Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum. Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma platys were not detected. Regardless of ownership status, vector-borne diseases were common in these dog populations. There was significant difference of pathogen prevalence among the different dog populations. Mycoplasma spp. was more frequent in the kennel dogs (31.9%) than in the pet (21.4%) and shepherd dogs (13.8%). Additionally, the frequency of Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp. was higher in the shepherd dogs which account for three quarters and half of the total number of Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp., respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Mycoplasma infection in dogs in Turkey. The results of the present study provide a foundation for understanding the epidemiology of canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs), and for strategies to control these diseases in Turkey. Â© 2017 W.

This study aimed to detect L. infantum spp. in asymptomatic stray dogs by molecular and serological methods in Mashhad, Iran, during 2011-12. In this study, 94 asymptomatic stray dogs were randomly selected and their blood samples were collected for indirect fluorescent antibody testing. Furthermore, tissue samples from all the L. infantum seropositive stray dogs were examined using semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Accordding to the results, 11.7 %(11/94) of the dogs were L. infantum seropositive. The PCR positivity rate of L. infantum was 63.6% (7/11) in at least one of the collected specimens of the seropositive dogs. The L. infantum kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) was detected in the liver of 36% (4/11), the spleen of 27% (3/11), and the skin of 54.5 %(6/11) of the stray dogs. In this study, based on the molecular and serological examinations, visceral leishmaniasis infection among the stray dogs in Mashhad was confirmed.

El Hamouchi, M. Riyad, K. Akarid, M. Lemrani;New epidemiological pattern of cutaneous leishmaniasis in two pre-Saharan arid provinces, southern Morocco;Three Leishmania species are responsible of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Morocco. Zoonotic CL due to Leishmania major and Leishmania infantum, the first is known as established in the eastern arid regions, whereas the latter evolves sporadically, especially in the North. While Leishmania tropica, classically considered anthroponotic, is endemic in the semi-arid regions and is largely distributed throughout the country. The aim of this study was to identify the Leishmania species causing CL in two Provinces in arid pre-Saharan region known as zoonotic CL foci, and to contribute an update to the national data concerning the distribution of Leishmania species in both regions. The recruitment of patients was done in six localities in Ouarzazate and Zagoura provinces in 2015 and 2016. Out of 81 samples collected, 66 were positive (81%) by ITS1-PCR amplification of Leishmania DNA extracted from stained smears. The highest rate of Leishmania infection was registered in children aged 9 years or less (71,2%). The ITS1-PCR- RFLP analysis revealed the predominance of L. major infecting 52 patients (79%), followed by L. tropica in 12 patients (18%) and L. infantum in 2 patients who had no history of travel outside the studied area (3%). The sequencing of the ITS1 of both L. infantum, showed 100% similarities with L. infantum strains isolated from dogs and visceral leishmaniasis patients from the south and north of Morocco. The coexistence of the 3 Leishmania species in the same focus, and the difficult distinction of infections associated to the different Leishmania species based only on clinical lesionsâ€™ aspects complicate the diagnosis and then the national control strategy, as well as the therapeutic management. The epidemiological pattern of CL in the studied areas appears to have changed during the last decades, from a predominant zoonotic CL caused by L. major to a polymorphic disease that can be due to any of the 3 Leishmania species. The expansion of L. infantum and L. tropica in southern parts of Morocco, calls for in depth epidemiological investigations for a better understanding of the CL situations in Southern parts of the country and for an assessment of the climate impact and environment changes on the leishmaniasis transmission system.

Five different apicomplexan parasite species were detected; among them three different species of Babesia: B. canis, B. microti, and B. ovis. Hepatozoon canis was the most frequently detected parasite, found predominately in Ixodes ricinus ticks collected from domestic dogs. It was also detected in I. ricinus collected from goat, fox, and cat. Furthermore, H. canis was found in Haemaphysalis punctata and Haemaphysalis concinna ticks. In addition, Theileria buffeli was detected in Rhipicephalus bursa ticks collected from cattle.

Georges, P. Pow-Brown;Novel incidental finding of Hepatozoon canis infection in two dogs of the same household in Trinidad, West Indies;A five-year old mixed breed bitch was presented to the veterinary clinic in lateral recumbency with a history of anorexia and muscle hyperaesthesia. Examination of the blood smear of this animal revealed the presence of Hepatozoon spp. gamonts in the neutrophils and monocytes with a parasitaemia level of approximately 2%. Complete blood count (CBC) revealed a neutrophilia, and a normocytic normochromic non-regenerative anaemia which were consistent with Hepatozoon spp. infections. Diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 18S rRNA gene followed by DNA sequencing of the amplicon. Although the other dog in the household appeared asymptomatic, Hepatozoon canis infection was confirmed by both microscopic examination of blood smear and PCR. Both dogs were infested with Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the H. canis sequences from these two dogs were similar to those from Venezuela and St Kitts but not Brazil. This is the first reported case of Hepatozoon canis infections in dogs in Trinidad that were confirmed by molecular techniques.

Although hepatozoonosis has been documented in a wide range of mammal species, data on cats are limited. To investigate the occurrence of these pathogens in cats, blood samples were collected from animals living in three provinces of southern Italy (Bari, Lecce, and Matera), and molecularly analysed by PCR amplification and sequencing of segments of the 18S rRNA gene. Out of 196 blood samples collected, Hepatozoon spp. DNA was amplified in ten cats (5.1%, CI: 3%-9%), with the majority of infected animals from Matera (8/34, 23.5%) and one each from the other two provinces. BLAST analysis revealed the highest nucleotide identity with sequences of H. canis, H. felis and H. silvestris deposited in GenBank. Results of this study indicate that these three species of Hepatozoon infect domestic cats in Italy. This is the first report of H. silvestris infection in a domestic cat.

Mohebali, A. Malmasi, M. Khodabakhsh, Z. Zarei, B. Akhoundi, H. Hajjaran, A. Azarm;Feline leishmaniosis due to Leishmania infantum in Northwest Iran: The role of cats in endemic areas of visceral leishmaniosis;Visceral leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) is an important zoonotic disease endemic in the Mediterranean region. Domestic dogs and other wild canines are the main reservoir hosts for the parasite, while domestic cats (Felis catus) may be carriers of L. infantum, and play a role as secondary reservoirs for the parasite. In the present study, serological (DAT), parasitological (microscopic smears and culture) and molecular methods (nested PCR) were used to evaluate infection with L. infantum in 103 stray cats collected from villages of Meshkin Shahr district, located in Ardabil province which is a well-known endemic region of human and canine visceral leishmaniosis in Iran. Overall, 25 out of 103 cats (24.27%) displayed anti-Leishmania antibodies with different titers. Amastigote forms of the parasite were detected in microscopic smears of the spleen of a cat with high anti-Leishmania antibodies using DAT. L. infantum was identified on microscopic slides by nested PCR, and the results were confirmed by sequence analysis. Based on the high rate of seropositive cats in this study, we conclude that cats may have an important role in the maintenance of L. infantum in the endemic areas of zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis in Iran.

Sandflies were captured in light traps located in the peridomiciliary environments of randomly selected houses in urban and rural settings between 1800 and 0600 hours on new moon days between March 2013 and February 2015. DNA extracts from 982 engorged female sandflies were submitted to fragment length polymorphism analysis to identify infecting species of Leishmania, and blood sources were identified for 778 of these specimens. Infection by Leishmania infantum was detected in Lutzomyia longipalpis, Lu. whitmani and Lu. termitophila; L. infantum/L. braziliensis in Lu. longipalpis, Lu. whitmani and Lu. trinidadensis; L. shawi in Lu. longipalpis; L. mexicana in Lu. longipalpis; L. braziliensis in Lu. longipalpis and Lu. whitmani; L. guyanensis in Lu. longipalpis and Lu. termitophila; L. amazonensis in Lu. longipalpis and L. lainsoni or L. naiffi in Lu. longipalpis, while Lu. longipalpis and Lu. trinidadensis were infected with unidentified Leishmania sp. Blood sources were identified in 573 individual phlebotomines and the preferred hosts were, in decreasing order, chicken, dog, rodent and human with lower preferences for pig, horse, opossum and cattle. Lu. longipalpis and Lu. whitmani performed mixed feeding on man, dog and rodent, while Lu. longipalpis was the most opportunistic species, feeding on the blood of all hosts surveyed, but preferably on dog/chicken, dog/rodent and rodent/chicken. Our findings reveal the concomitant circulation of Leishmania species that cause visceral leishmaniasis and tegumentary leishmaniasis in the study area, and explain the occurrence of autochthonous human cases of both clinical forms of leishmaniasis in Caxias, MaranhÃ£o. The results support our hypothesis that, in the municipality of Caxias, transmission of Leishmania occurs in close proximity to humans. Â© 2017 GuimarÃ£es-e-Silva et al.

Molina;Phlebotomine sand fly survey in the focus of leishmaniasis in Madrid, Spain (2012-2014): Seasonal dynamics, Leishmania infantum infection rates and blood meal preferences;Background: An unusual increase of human leishmaniasis cases due to Leishmania infantum is occurring in an urban area of southwestern Madrid, Spain, since 2010. Entomological surveys have shown that Phlebotomus perniciosus is the only potential vector. Direct xenodiagnosis in hares (Lepus granatensis) and rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) collected in the focus area proved that they can transmit parasites to colonized P. perniciosus. Isolates were characterized as L. infantum. The aim of the present work was to conduct a comprehensive study of sand flies in the outbreak area, with special emphasis on P. perniciosus. Methods: Entomological surveys were done from June to October 2012-2014 in 4 stations located close to the affected area. Twenty sticky traps (ST) and two CDC light traps (LT) were monthly placed during two consecutive days in every station. LT were replaced every morning. Sand fly infection rates were determined by dissecting females collected with LT. Molecular procedures applied to study blood meal preferences and to detect L. infantum were performed for a better understanding of the epidemiology of the outbreak. Results: A total of 45,127 specimens belonging to 4 sand fly species were collected: P. perniciosus (75.34%), Sergentomyia minuta (24.65%), Phlebotomus sergenti (0.005%) and Phlebotomus papatasi (0.005%). No Phlebotomus ariasi were captured. From 3203 P. perniciosus female dissected, 117 were infected with flagellates (3.7%). Furthermore, 13.31% and 7.78% of blood-fed and unfed female sand flies, respectively, were found infected with L. infantum by PCR. The highest rates of infected P. perniciosus were detected at the end of the transmission periods. Regarding to blood meal preferences, hares and rabbits were preferred, although human, cat and dog blood were also found. Conclusions: This entomological study highlights the exceptional nature of the Leishmania outbreak occurring in southwestern Madrid, Spain. It is confirmed that P. perniciosus is the only vector in the affected area, with high densities and infection rates. Rabbits and hares were the main blood meal sources of this species. These results reinforce the need for an extensive and permanent surveillance in this region, and others of similar characteristics, in order to control the vector and regulate the populations of wild reservoirs.

Tolezano;Visceral leishmaniasis in an environmentally protected area in southeastern Brazil: Epidemiological and laboratory cross-sectional investigation of phlebotomine fauna, wild hosts and canine cases;Background: Leishmaniasis is a rapidly expanding zoonosis that shows increasing urbanization. Concern exists regarding the role of wildlife in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) transmission, due to frequent natural or anthropogenic environmental changes that facilitate contact between wildlife, humans and their pets. The municipality of Campinas, in southeastern Brazil, initially recorded VL in 2009, when the first autochthonous case was confirmed in a dog living in an upscale residential condominium, located inside an environmentally protected area (EPA). Since then, disease transmission remains restricted to dogs inhabiting two geographically contiguous condominiums within the EPA. Methodology/Principal findings: We conducted a cross-sectional study of the VL focus to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals and sand flies using molecular tools and recommended serological techniques. Canine seroprevalences of 1.5% and 1.2% were observed in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six insect species, confirmed or suspected vectors or potential transmitters of Leishmania, were identified. Two specimens of the main L. (L.) infantum vector in Brazil, Lutzomyia longipalpis, were captured in the EPA. Natural infection by L. (L.) infantum was recorded in one Expapillata firmatoi specimen and two Pintomyia monticola. Natural infection by L. (L.) infantum and Leishmania subgenus Viannia was also detected in two white-eared opossums (Didelphis albiventris), a known reservoir of VL. Geographical coordinates of each sampling of infected animals were plotted on a map of the EPA, demonstrating proximity between these animals, human residences, including the dogs positive for VL, and forest areas. Conclusions/Significance: The EPA, which is inhabited by humans, has an active VL focus. The risk of establishing and maintaining disease transmission foci in similar scenarios, i.e. wild areas that undergo environmental modifications, is evident. Moreover, different epidemiological profiles of VL must be included to elaborate prevention and control measures that consider the particularities of each transmission area.

Leonard;Recurrence of visceral and muco-cutaneous leishmaniasis in a patient under immunosuppressive therapy;Background: Leishmaniasis is a protozoan disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania, transmitted to humans by sandflies. The diagnosis of leishmaniasis is often challenging as it mimics many other infectious or malignant diseases. The disease can present in three ways: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, or visceral leishmaniasis, which rarely occur together or consecutively. Case presentation: The patient was a 52 years old immunosuppressed Belgian woman with a long history of severe rheumatoid arthritis. She underwent bone marrow biopsy to explore thrombocytopenia. Diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis was made by identification of Leishman Donovan (LD) bodies in macrophages. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B was successful. She later developed cutaneous leishmaniasis treated with amphotericin B lipid complex. She next presented with relapsing cutaneous lesions followed by rapidly progressing lymphadenopathies. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. Treatments by miltefosine, amphotericin B, N-methyl-glucamine antimoniate were subsequently initiated. She later presented a recurrent bone marrow involvement treated with intramuscular paromomycin and miltefosine. She died two years later from leukemia. At the time of death, she presented with a mucosal destruction of the nose. A Leishmania-specific PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) identified L. infantum as etiological agent. Conclusions: Clinicians should be aware of the potential concomitant or sequential involvement of multiple anatomic localizations of Leishmania in immunosuppressed patients.

Beugnet, E. Papadopoulos, D. Otranto;Ticks and associated pathogens in dogs from Greece;Background: With the aim to assess the occurrence of hard ticks and the pathogens they may carry in dogs from Greece, ixodid specimens (n = 757) were collected from 310 animals living in six provinces across the Greek peninsula. All ticks were morphologically identified, and genomic DNA was extracted from 344 (45.5%) representative specimens, according to their species, engorgement status and sampling area. The occurrence of Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Rickettsia spp., Babesia spp., Theileria spp. and Cercopithifilaria spp. was assessed by conventional and quantitative real-time PCR. Results: Overall, 150 dogs (48.4%) were infested by ticks, with Rhipicephalus sanguineus (sensu lato) being the most prevalent (70.1%), followed by Haemaphysalis parva (14.7%), Rhipicephalus turanicus (11.4%), and Haemaphysalis concinna (2.4%). Out of 344 specimens molecularly examined, 41 (11.1%) were positive for at least one microorganism (i.e. 5.5% for Cercopithifilaria bainae, 2.9% for Hepatozoon canis, 1.7% for Rickettsia hoogstraalii, 1.2% for Hepatozoon felis, 0.6% for Rickettsia massiliae, 0.6% for Theileria ovis, 0.3% for Anaplasma platys and 0.3% for Coxiella like-endosymbiont). Conclusions: The results of this study show that different tick species parasitize dogs in Greece, carrying a range of microorganisms potentially pathogenic for dogs and humans. Consequently, control strategies against ticks are of great importance to prevent the risk of tick-borne diseases. The relationship between ticks infesting dogs and associated microorganisms is described according to collection site and dog lifestyle.

Madeira De Carvalho, L. Cardoso, D. Otranto;Molecular detection of vector-borne pathogens in dogs and cats from Qatar;"Background: Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) have been increasingly reported in dogs and cats worldwide. However, no data are currently available regarding canine and feline VBDs in Qatar and limited information is available from other Persian Gulf countries. Methods: Blood samples from 98 client-owned animals (i.e. 64 dogs and 34 cats) living in Doha (Qatar) were collected and the presence of genomic DNA of Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Dirofilaria spp., Ehrlichia spp., Hepatozoon spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Rickettsia spp. was assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), real time-PCR (rt-PCR) and sequence analysis. Results: Of the 64 dogs, 12 (18.8%) were infected with at least one pathogen (i.e. 7.8% with Mycoplasma spp., 4.7% with Babesia vogeli, 3.1% with Ehrlichia canis, and 1.6% with Anaplasma platys, Babesia gibsoni and Hepatozoon canis, each). One of the 12 dogs was co-infected with B. vogeli and E. canis. Of the 34 cats, seven (20.6%) animals were infected with at least one pathogen (i.e. 5.9% were positive for Mycoplasma spp., and 2.9% for Babesia felis, B. vogeli, E. canis, ""Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum"" and Mycoplasma haemofelis, each). No dogs or cats were positive for Dirofilaria spp. or Rickettsia spp. Conclusions: Although the sample sizes of dogs and cats herein analysed was moderately small, data from this study report the occurrence of A. platys, B. vogeli, B. gibsoni, E. canis, H. canis and Mycoplasma spp. in domestic dogs and of B. felis, B. vogeli, ""Candidatus M. haemominutum"", E. canis and M. haemofelis in domestic cats from Qatar. Further investigations along with prophylactic measures are strongly recommended in order to reduce the risk of dogs and cats acquiring VBDs in Qatar.

Aktas, S. Ozubek;A survey of canine haemoprotozoan parasites from Turkey, including molecular evidence of an unnamed Babesia;"Canine tick-borne apicomplexan parasites have emerged in recent years, showing a wider geographic distribution and increased global prevalence. A reverse line blot assay was performed on 219 blood samples collected from domestic dogs for simultaneous detection of all named canine piroplasm species as well as Hepatozoon canis. Ten samples hybridized to the Theileria/Babesia and Babesia catch all probes but did not hybridize to any species-specific probe tested, suggesting the presence of an unrecognized Babesia species or genotype. Sequencing results showed 91.5%, 91.9%, 92.4%, 92.4%, and 89.2% similarity to B. canis, B. vogeli, B. rossi, B. gibsoni, and B. conradae, respectively. The highest homology (98.1â€“98.5%) observed was with unnamed Babesia sp. isolates (Ludhiana and Malbazar) described in dogs, Babesia sp. of buffalo origin, Babesia sp. Kashi 2, and Babesia orientalis, along with Babesia occultans of cattle origin. The partial cox1 sequence indicated that this isolate was most similar to Babesia sp. 1 HG-2012, with an identity of 86.5%. The survey revealed high prevalence of haemoprotozoans in domestic dogs (57.5%, CI 50.7â€“64.2), with Hepatozoon canis the most prevalent (54.3%, CI 47.5â€“61.117%), followed by Babesia sp. (4.6%, CI 2.2â€“8.2), B. vogeli (1.4%; CI 0.3â€“3.9), and B. canis (0.4%, CI 0â€“2.5). Combined infection of Hepatozoon canis and Babesia sp. was detected in five (2.3%, CI 0.7â€“5.2) samples and of H. canis and B. vogeli in two (0.9%, CI 0.1â€“3.2) dogs. The study contributes insight into the distribution and phylogenetic diversity of canine piroplasms in Turkey.

Genomic DNA of this blood parasite was detected in 51 (17.1%) foxes from all sampling regions in Slovakia, whereas the overall prevalence in examined dogs was significantly lower, only 1.0%. Identity between nucleotide sequences from Slovak foxes and dogs ranged from 97.3 to 100%. Phylogenetic analysis showed that H. canis isolates from Slovakia are divided into two clusters, suggesting the coexistence of strain variants with unknown pathogenicity which needs to be further explored.

In 2006, a country-wide collection of sand flies performed in 14 sites selected based on recent occurrence of VL cases showed that Phlebotomus neglectus was by far the most prevalent species (95.6%). Furthermore, 15% of pools made from 422 P. neglectus females tested positive for Leishmania sp. genomic DNA. In the same year, Culicoides trapping was performed for bluetongue disease surveillance in 91 sites of southern Albania, targeting livestock farms regardless recent occurrence of VL in the surveyed areas. In 35 sites where sand flies were collected along with midges, Phlebotomus perfiliewi was the most prevalent among the Phlebotomus species identified, however search for leishmanial DNA in females of this species was unsuccessful. In 2011, sand flies were trapped in 4 sites of north Albania characterized by high VL incidence, and females were dissected to search for Leishmania infections. Both P. neglectus and P. tobbi were collected at high densities. Two positive specimens were detected from a sample of 64 P. neglectus trapped in one site (3.1%). Parasites were successfully cultured from one specimen and characterized as belonging to Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON-1, the only zymodeme so far identified as the agent of human and canine leishmaniasis in the country. Altogether our studies indicate that P. neglectus is the main leishmaniasis vector in Albania. Â© 2017 Velo et al.

Merialdi;Distinct leishmania infantum strains circulate in humans and dogs in the Emilia-Romagna region, northeastern Italy;Human leishmaniasis is an emerging problem in Italy and is on the increase in the Emilia-Romagna region, northeastern part of the country. Nevertheless, studies dealing with the molecular characterization of Leishmania spp. circulating in these areas are limited. In the present work, we explored the genetic polymorphism of Leishmania isolates from 28 cases of canine leishmaniasis and three cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which occurred in 2013-2014 in the Emilia-Romagna region. The characterization was carried out in comparison with nine human isolates of Leishmania from other VL endemic Italian regions and two reference strains. Nucleic acid from 31 Leishmania-positive phlebotomine sandfly pools, sampled in 2012-2013 in the Emilia-Romagna region, were also evaluated. DNA amplification and sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer-1 and of a repetitive nuclear region on chromosome 31 were carried out for genotyping. Two size polymorphic targets were also analyzed by PCR, the cpb E/F-gene and the k26-gene. Altogether, the analysis showed the circulation of different Leishmania infantum genotypes in the Emilia-Romagna region: two genotypes found in dogs from public kennels were similar to VL isolates from other Italian regions, whereas a third genotype was detected in VL cases of the Emilia-Romagna region and in all but one of the sandfly pools. The combined molecular tools applied in this study can constitute a helpful support for parasite tracking (e.g., in outbreak investigations) and for a better understanding of the epidemiological evolution of leishmaniasis in northeastern Italy.

Recent epidemiological evidences indicate that blood donor may be harbor of Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) infection in Iran. Methods The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Leishmania infection among blood donors in a main endemic focus of VL in Iran using DAT and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based methods Between Julyâ€“September 2016, blood samples were collected from 600 apparently healthy blood donors from six blood donation centers and blood donation mobile unit in Ardabil Province, where VL cases had been recorded. Each of these samples was tested for anti-Leishmania antibodies, in direct agglutination test (DAT), and for L. infantum kDNA, the PCR-based assay. Results Of 600 blood donors, which were examined, 23 (3.8%) blood donors were seropositive by DAT and of 23 seropositive subjects, 82.6% (19/23) were positive by PCR. All the seropositive cases were males except one of them was female. Conclusions Our findings showed that many asymptomatic human carriers of L. infantum live in the endemic regions of northwestern Iran and potentially act as reservoirs of infection; those must be considered carefully by arrangement VL control strategies in the country.

These PCR products have individual sequences of Babesia spp. (from 8 ticks), Theileria spp. (from 9 ticks: one tick sample including at least two Theileria spp. sequences), and Hepatozoon spp. (from 3 ticks). Phylogenetic analyses revealed that these sequences were close to those of undescribed Babesia spp. detected in feral raccoons in Japan (5 sequences; 3 sequences being identical), Babesia gibsoni-like parasites detected in pigs in China (3 sequences; all sequences being identical), Theileria spp. detected in sika deer in Japan and China (10 sequences; 2 sequences being identical), Hepatozoon canis (one sequence), and Hepatozoon spp. detected in Japanese martens in Japan (two sequences). In summary, we showed that various tick-borne parasites exist in Kagoshima, the southern region in Japan by using the novel nested PCR system. These including undescribed species such as Babesia gibsoni-like parasites previously detected in pigs in China. Importantly, our results revealed new combinations of ticks and protozoan parasites in southern Japan. The results of this study will aid in the recognition of potential parasitic animal diseases caused by tick-borne parasites.

Solano-Gallego;Species of ticks and carried pathogens in owned dogs in Spain: Results of a one-year national survey;"This study presents the results of a national survey in Spain on the distribution of ticks on owned dogs, their phenology and the associated pathogens over one year. In the study, 1628 adult ticks were collected on 660 dogs presented to 26 veterinary practices, of which 507 dogs (76.8%) carried at least one adult tick. The primary species of ticks were Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l. (53%), Dermacentor reticulatus (9%), Ixodes ricinus (9%), and I. hexagonus (4%). Parasitism by two species of these ticks was rare. The four species showed a clear association with the biogeographical features of the country, with I. ricinus associated with the wettest northern regions, I. hexagonus and D. reticulatus associated with the north of the territory, and R. sanguineus s.l. prevalent throughout the entire country. Dogs living in rural areas had a higher prevalence of all species, but R. sanguineus s.l. was the most prevalent; however, this tick was also more common on dogs living indoors. R. sanguineus s.l. adults were active throughout the year, with a maximum peak from March to July. The other tick species were collected throughout the year, with an autumn-winter peak of D. reticulatus, but without clear seasonality for either I. ricinus or I. hexagonus. Combined real-time PCR and conventional PCR of the feeding ticks recorded Piroplasmida (Hepatozoon canis, Babesia canis, B. gibsoni, and several sequences compatible with Theileria spp.), Rickettsia spp. (R. massiliae, R. sibirica mongolitimonae, R. monacensis), Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys, A. phagocytophilum and Borrelia spp. (B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. valaisiana). Hepatozoon canis and B. canis were the most frequently detected pathogens, with variable rates of infection according to the region. Other than a close association of Borrelia spp. with I. ricinus (and therefore to the wet northern areas of the territory), the other tick-borne pathogens were recorded throughout the country. Although a potential transmission role for ticks carrying unusual pathogens cannot be attributed to these results, these findings introduce a change of paradigm on the tick-borne pathogen distribution in Spain and emphasize the importance of performing active surveys to understand the complex patterns of tick-borne pathogen distributions and their vectors.

Ã¶zbel;Molecular screening of Leishmania spp. infection and bloodmeals in sandflies from a leishmaniasis focus in southwestern Turkey;Leishmaniasis is an arthropod-borne disease that affects approximately 2 million people worldwide annually. The aims of this study were to detect the presence of Leishmania (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) DNA and the feeding preferences of probable vector species in an endemic focus of Leishmania infantum in Turkey. Entomological sampling was performed in August and October 2015 in AydÄ±n province, where cases of human and canine leishmaniasis have been reported previously. A total of 1059 sandfly specimens comprising nine species belonging to two genera, Phlebotomus and Sergentomyia (both: Diptera: Psychodidae), and five subgenera of the Phlebotomus genus (Phlebotomus, Paraphlebotomus, Larroussius, Adlerius and Transphlebotomus) were collected in five villages. Among all Phlebotomus specimens, Phlebotomus neglectus (39%) was noted as the most abundant species, followed by Phlebotomus tobbi (18%). Leishmania DNA was detected in pools from P. neglectus, P. tobbi and Sergentomyia dentata by kDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Leishmania DNA from Phlebotomus specimens was identified as L. infantum, but Leishmania DNA from Sergentomyia spp. could not be identified to species level by ITS-1 real-time PCR. The detection of Leishmania DNA in wild-caught P. neglectus and the high percentage (24.2%) of human DNA in engorged specimens suggests that P. neglectus is probably an important vector species for L. infantum in AydÄ±n province.

BariÄ‡ Rafaj;Prevalence and geographic distribution of vector-borne pathogens in apparently healthy dogs in Croatia;Vector-borne pathogens (VBPs) are a group of globally extended and quickly spreading pathogens that are transmitted by various arthropod vectors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the seroprevalence against Babesia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis, and Ehrlichia canis in dogs in Croatia. We investigated 435 randomly selected apparently healthy dogs in 13 different locations of Croatia for antibodies to B. canis by indirect immunofluorescence using a commercial IFA IgG Antibody Kit. All samples were also tested for qualitative detection of D. immitis antigen and for antibodies to A. phagocytophilum, B. burgdorferi sensu lato, L. infantum, and E. canis with two point-of-care assays. Overall, 112 dogs (25.74%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 21.70-30.12) were serologically positive for one or more of the pathogens. B. canis was the most prevalent pathogen (20.00%, 95% CI 16.34-24.07), followed by A. phagocytophilum (6.21%, 95% CI 4.12-8.90), L. infantum, (1.38%, 95% CI 0.51-2.97), and B. burgdorferi sensu lato (0.69%, 95% CI 0.01-2.00). The lowest seroprevalence was for D. immitis and E. canis (0.46%, 95% CI 0.01-1.65). Coinfection was determined in 12 dogs (2.76%, 95% CI 1.43-4.77), of which 10 were positive to two pathogens (7 with B. canis and A. phagocytophilum and 1 B. canis with B. burgdorferi sensu lato or L. infantum or E. canis). One dog was positive to three pathogens and another dog to four pathogens. Seroprevalence for babesia was age, breed, and lifestyle/use dependent. Purebred dogs had almost half the chance of developing disease than crossbred (OR = 0.58, p < 0.026, 95% CI 0.37-0.94). Seropositivity to B. canis was 3.41 times higher for dogs that lived outdoors/shelter (p < 0.006) or 4.57 times higher in mixed/hunting (p < 0.001) compared to indoor/companion dogs. This is the first comprehensive survey of VBP seropositivity conducted in Croatia. Some of these VBPs are zoonotic and represent a potential risk to public health.

Palop-Larrea;Community outbreak of cutaneous leishmaniasis in La Ribera region of Valencia, Spain: Public Health measures;Introduction Outbreaks of human leishmaniasis are not very common in Spain, despite being considered an endemic disease. In this study, a new outbreak in the Valencian Community is presented. Its principal objective is to describe the clinical-epidemiological characteristics and to present the main Public Health measures established to contain the outbreak. Methods A case was defined as anyone residing in the village of Tous (in Valencian Community), diagnosed with leishmaniasis according to clinical and laboratory criteria, defined by the Epidemiological Surveillance Network, and date of symptoms onset between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2013. A descriptive analysis was performed on the epidemiological variables collected. Results A total of 19 cases were reported from the 28th week of 2012 to the 30th week of 2013. Adults were most affected by the disease (73%). The most common clinical form was cutaneous leishmaniasis (89%). More than three-quarters (79%) of cases were confirmed by PCR. Species typing was performed on seven samples, with the parasite Leishmania infantum being identified. Patient outcome was favourable after physical (31%), or pharmacological (69%) treatment. Some kind of residual damage was observed in 37% of cases. Different measures were applied, aimed at health professionals, and vector and reservoir control, as well as general recommendations to the population for the containment of the outbreak. Conclusions This cutaneous leishmaniasis outbreak confirms the endemic nature and the high prevalence of the disease in the Mediterranean area. The most commonly used treatment was intralesional meglumine antimoniate. A comprehensive plan of action had to be developed in order to control the outbreak.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a notifiable parasitic disease that increased in incidence in Morocco over the past few years and has recently emerged in several new foci, causing a public health problem in Morocco. The aim of this study is to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of VL in Morocco between 1990 and 2014 period in order to highlight important features and trends of VL and its epidemiology and to assess whether the activity of the unit reflects the situation of the disease at the national level and whether it could constitute an indicator of public health relevance. Two thousand four hundred and twenty one cases were reported in Morocco between 1990 and 2014 with an average annual reported incidence rate of 0.4 cases per 100.000 inhabitants. Before 1996 the average annual incidence of VL was 50 cases on average. After this date the number of cases increased and then remained stable with around 100â€“150 cases per year. Children whose age varies between 1 and 4 years old are the most affected with 1327 (74%) of total cases; nevertheless the adult starts to be affected by the disease. In 2000, 65% of positive cases of VL are concentrated at both northern regions: Taza-Al Hoceima- Taounate with 45% of cases, Tanger- Tetouan mainly represented by Chefchaoun with 20% of cases. The Fez-Boulemane region located in the center recorded 12% of cases. Throughout the years the map VL distribution has been progressively changed and spatial spread of the disease to the center is noted in 2007. 2014 has been marked by an even greater extension of the disease to the center and south of Morocco. Nationally in 2014, 34 of 75 provinces and prefectures are affected compared to 2000, when 22 out of 82 provinces and prefectures were affected. Leishmania infantum was identified the causative agent based on species- specific PCR-Lei70 assay. VL remains a sporadically endemic parasitic disease in Morocco with a progressive extension of its range of distribution. Such a situation would relate to the geographical succession of Phlebotomine sand fly vectors, the difficulty of actions against the canine population reservoirs of L. infantum and unfavorable socio-economic factors.

Galati;Ecological parameters of the (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B population of the Lutzomyia longipalpis complex in a visceral leishmaniasis area in SÃ£o Paulo state, Brazil;"Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important public health challenge in Brazil because of the high number of human and canine cases reported annually. Leishmania infantum is the etiological agent of VL and Lutzomyia longipalpis is its main vector. However, evidence suggests that this taxon constitutes a species complex. In Sao Paulo state, there are two populations of Lu. longipalpis, each secreting distinct pheromones, (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B and Cembrene 1; both have been associated with different patterns of VL transmission. The aim of the present study was to investigate the temporal distribution and natural infection of the (S)-9-methylgermacrene-B population of the Lu. longipalpis complex in a highly VL endemic area of Sao Paulo state to obtain information that may contribute to the surveillance of this zoonosis and to the planning of preventive and control measures. Methods: The study was carried out in Panorama municipality, Sao Paulo State. Captures were made during 24 months in seven domiciles. The relation between sand fly abundance and climatic variables, temperature and humidity, was analyzed and natural infection by Leishmania spp. in sand fly females was investigated by nested PCR. Results: A total of 4120 sand flies, with predominance of Lu. longipalpis (97.2%) were captured. The highest averages of sand flies/night/trap occurred in the rainy season (November-March) and a positive, significant correlation between sand fly abundance and the temperature and humidity 20 days before the capture days was found. Leishmania infantum DNA was detected in three out of 250 pools of females analyzed, giving an estimated minimum infection rate of 1.2%. Conclusion: The identification of the climatic association between the high abundance of the vector in this highly endemic VL focus constitutes a fundamental point for evaluating future vector and dog control measures and this information increases the data of VL foci in Sao Paulo state that could contribute to the public health authorities in planning prevention and control measures. The identification of natural infection by Le. infantum in Lu. longipalpis specimens reinforces the importance of entomological surveillance activities in this municipality.

Vezzani, C.F. Scodellaro, D.F. Eiras;Hematological and epidemiological characterization of Hepatozoon canis infection in dogs from Buenos Aires, Argentina;Canine hepatozoonosis caused by Hepatozoon canis is widespread in America. In Argentina, since the first finding of the disease in Buenos Aires in 1999, several isolated cases were reported in other six provinces. However, there is no information regarding hematological and epidemiological characterization of the disease in the country. A total of 100,123 canine blood samples obtained during the period 2002â€“2013 from Southern Greater Buenos Aires were examined by light microscopy. Overall prevalence was 2.3%, with high parasitemia levels (Â 800Â gamonts/Î¼l) in 680 samples, mild (100â€“800) in 1088, and low (Â 100) in 433 patients. Among parasitemic dogs, anemia (mostly non-regenerative) was present in 56.9%. Inflammatory leukogram, defined as neutrophilia with or without leukocytosis, with or without left shift and left shift with or without neutrophilia, was the main hematological abnormality and was present in 74.1% of positively tested dogs. A clear seasonal tendency was observed, with maximum values in summer and minimal in winter, and an increasing prevalence was recorded during the study decade. Young, male and mixed breed dogs showed higher prevalence values. Our findings strongly suggest that canine hepatozoonosis is endemic and expanding in the region.

GÃ¡lvez;Epidemiological role of dogs since the human leishmaniosis outbreak in Madrid;"Background: Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) has been in the spotlight since the 2009 outbreak of human leishmaniosis in Madrid. In the framework of the Leishmaniosis Surveillance Programme set up in Madrid, this study examines Leishmania-specific seroprevalences in stray dogs for the outbreak area and rest of the Madrid region over the period spanning from the outbreak to the present (2009-2016). These data are of interest because stray dogs could be sentinels for disease surveillance in endemic areas. Since 2011, we have also been monitoring owned dogs in the outbreak area. Methods: Over the study period, Leishmania infantum seroprevalence was determined in 2,123 stray dogs from the outbreak and non-outbreak areas. A serological study was also performed for owned dogs in the outbreak area: high-risk dogs such as hunting or farm dogs (n = 1,722) and pets (n = 1372). All dogs were examined and blood was collected. The variables recorded for each animal were: breed, age, sex, and clinical history indicating if the animal was healthy or clinically suspected of having any disease, and if they showed a clinical picture compatible with CanL. Results: Seroprevalences of L. infantum in stray dogs were similar in the two areas examined: 4.7% (20 out of 346) in the outbreak area and 5.4% (96 out of 1,777) in the remaining Madrid region (Ï‡ 2 = 0.080, P = 0.777). A significant association was found between seroprevalence and age (z = -6.319; P &lt; 0.001). Seroprevalence in owned dogs in the outbreak area was 2.1% in high-risk dogs (37 out of 1,722) and 1.2% in pets (17 out of 1,372) (Ï‡ 2 = 3.561, P = 0.0591). Conclusions: Both stray and owned dogs do not seem to play an important role in maintaining the transmission cycle of L. infantum in the Madrid outbreak area. The stable seroprevalence of infection observed in sentinel dogs suggests the good clinical management and prevention of CanL by local practitioners in owned dogs.

Infection of the first generation female likely occurred during a breeding visit to Italy and the dog died with typical clinical signs of the disease but without definitive laboratory diagnosis. The second and third generation offsprings never left the Czech Republic, suffered from clinical CanL confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and serology, and were apparently infected by transplacental transmission. Persistence of CanL in the Czech Republic over 7 years with a suspected origin in an endemic region and progression of infection through subsequent generations in a non-endemic country exemplifies that this disease may establish itself also in areas where no obvious vectors are present.

This study aimed to observe tick borne pathogens in dogs from Palestine including Hepatozoon canis and Babesia species. The prevalence of both H. canis and Babesia species infections in apparently healthy dogs, from ten districts of the West Bank was surveyed. DNA was extracted from blood samples obtained from dogs (n = 362) and ticks (n = 213) collected from dogs (n = 77). A primer set that amplifies a partial sequence of the Babesia and Hepatozoon 18S rRNA gene was used for PCR and the DNA sequences of the PCR products of all samples were determined. Twenty-nine (8Â·0%) of the dogs were found infected including 20 with H. canis (5Â·5%), seven with Babesia vogeli (1Â·9%) and two with undefined Babesia spp. (0Â·6%). Twelve Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l ticks were pathogen-positive, including ten with H. canis (4Â·7%), one with B. vogeli (0Â·5%), and one with Hepatozoon felis (0Â·5%). The results indicated that a wide range of tick borne pathogens is circulating in the canine population in the surveyed region. This study is the first report on the prevalence of H. canis, B. vogeli and Babesia spp. in dogs in Palestine and its results will assist in the management of diseases associated with these blood parasites.

The areas were categorized and selected according to disease incidence: low (area-1), medium (area-2) and high (area-3). Cross-sectional study enrolling 935 children was used to estimate the prevalence of infection by L. infantum. Volunteers from these three areas were tested for L. infantum infection by ELISA (rK39 and soluble antigens). Infection prevalence rates were estimated and compared with the RR of disease. Multilevel logistic regression model evaluated the relationship between infection and the analysed variables. The RR of HVL was distributed heterogeneously in the municipality. The infection prevalence rates were: 34Â·9% in area-1; 29Â·3% in area-2; and 33Â·6% in area-3, with no significant differences between these areas. The variables 'Presence of backyards in the neighbourhood' and 'Younger children' were associated with L. infantum infection. We conclude that infection by L. infantum affects a significant proportion of the infant population regardless of the RR of disease.

Observations The patient was a septuagenarian male whose presentation and clinical course were thought to be most consistent with viral meningoencephalitis. ELISA suggested recent infection with EEE virus. Microscopic analysis of the brain demonstrated perivascular lymphohistiocytic cuffing which was consistent with viral type encephalitis. Similarly, both eyes manifested a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in the retina and optic nerve and a reduced number of ganglion cells. Conclusions and importance To our knowledge, this is the first report of ophthalmological and ocular pathology observations in an EEE patient. Interestingly, the inflammatory findings in the retina are reminiscent of the central nervous system effects of EEE virus. These findings are relevant given the recent epidemic of microcephaly and ophthalmic complications secondary to another arboviral virus, the Zika virus.

Andrade Filho;Seasonality of sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) and Leishmania DNA detection in vector species in an area with endemic visceral leishmaniasis;BACKGROUND Leishmaniases are a serious health problem in southeast Brazil, including the city of Belo Horizonte (BH), Minas Gerais state (MG), where there are high rates of incidence and mortality due to visceral leishmaniases. BH is divided into nine sanitary districts (SD) of which one, the Venda Nova SD, was selected for this study because it has high rates of positivity for canine leishmaniasis and high incidence of human leishmaniasis. OBJECTIVES This study aimed to survey the sand fly fauna in Venda Nova SD from August 2011 to July 2013 and perform a descriptive analysis of the vector population. METHODS The sampling was carried out using automatic HP light traps at all covered areas of the Venda Nova SD, in a total of eighteen light traps. Sampled specimens were identified following Galati (2003), and females were submitted to molecular techniques for the detection and identification of Leishmania DNA. A simple environmental description was done for it area and Kernel estimation was used to infer vector density for each study site. FINDINGS A total of 2,427 sand fly specimens belonging to eight species and five genera were collected of which 95.3% were Lutzomyia longipalpis. The seasonal variation curve was delineated by this species. Lu. longipalpis was the most abundant at all collection points and in all months of the study, and exhibited a natural infection rate of 1.01% for Leishmania infantum and 1.77% for Leishmania braziliensis. MAIN CONCLUSIONS The results show the presence and adaptation of Lu. longipalpis to the anthropic environment of BH and reinforces its role as the main vector of L. infantum in the region.

Canine tick-borne diseases in pet dogs from Romania Parasites and Vectors, 10(1),  #Pages#; M.O. Andersson, C. Tolf, P. Tamba, M. Stefanache, J. WaldenstrÃ¶m, G. Dobler, L. Chitimia-Dobler;Canine tick-borne diseases in pet dogs from Romania;"Background: Tick-borne diseases are of substantial concern worldwide for animals as well as humans. Dogs have been a human companion for millennia, and their significant impact on human life renders disease in dogs to be of great concern. Tick-borne diseases in dogs represent a substantial diagnostic challenge for veterinarians in that clinical signs are often diffuse and overlapping. In addition, co-infections with two or more pathogens enhance this problem further. Molecular methods are useful to disentangle co-infections and to accurately describe prevalence and geographical distribution of tick-borne diseases. At this point, this information is lacking in many areas worldwide. Romania is one such area, where prevalence and distribution of several important pathogens need to be further investigated. To address this, we screened blood samples from 96 sick dogs with molecular methods for eight different pathogens including Babesia spp., Theileria spp., Hepatozoon spp., Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp., ""Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis"", Mycoplasma spp., and Borrelia spp. Results: As many as 45% (43/96) of the dogs in the study were infected with protozoan parasites. Babesia canis was the most frequent of these (28 infected dogs), whereas Hepatozoon canis was detected in 15% (14/96) and Babesia gibsoni was found in a single sample. Bacterial infection with Mycoplasma spp. occurred in 18% (17/96) of the sampled dogs. Obtained bacterial sequences revealed the occurrence of two species: Mycoplasma canis and ""Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum"". In several cases co-infection with protozoan parasites and Mycoplasma sp. were detected. All dogs were negative for Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp., ""Ca. Neoehrlichia mikurensis"", and for Borrelia spp. Conclusions: The results from the present study reinforce the notion that Babesia canis is an important pathogen in the Romanian dog population. However, more surprisingly, another protozoan species, H. canis, seems to be infecting dogs to a larger extent than previously recognized in Romania. Well-known tick-borne bacterial disease agents such as Anaplasma spp. and Borrelia spp. were not detected. In contrast, less well-studied bacteria such as hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. were detected frequently. Moreover, co-infection might aggravate disease and complicate diagnosis and should be further studied in dogs.

We report here results of both serological and molecular prevalence studies for major CVBDs of dogs from all over the South Korean Peninsula except for Jeju Island. Results: Serological survey of 532 outdoor dogs revealed the highest prevalence for Dirofilaria immitis (25.2%), followed by Anaplasma phagocytophilum (15.6%), Ehrlichia canis (4.7%) whereas Borrelia burgdorferi showed the lowest prevalence (1.1%). The number of serologically positive dogs for any of the four pathogens was 216 (40.6%). Concurrent real-time PCR assay of 440 dogs in the study indicated that DNA of â€œCandidatus M. haematoparvumâ€, Mycoplasma haemocanis, Babesia gibsoni, A. phagocytophilum, and Hepatozoon canis was identified in 190 (43.2%), 168 (38.2%), 23 (5.2%), 10 (2.3%) and 1 (0.2%) dogs, respectively.

Analysis of questionnaires collected from owners of 440 dogs showed that the number of dogs with heartworm preventive medication was 348 (79.1%) among which dogs still positive to D. immitis infection were 60 (17.2%), probably due to the mean months of heartworm preventive medication being only 6.5. The high prevalence rates of both â€œCa. M. haematoparvumâ€ and Mycoplasma haemocanis in dogs from Korea indicate that these organisms may be transmitted by vectors other than Rhipicephalus sanguineus because this tick species has rarely been found in Korea. This is the first nationwide survey for canine haemotropic mycoplasma infections in Korea. Conclusions: This study showed that the risk of exposure to major vector-borne diseases in dogs is quite high throughout all areas of South Korean Peninsula. Since achieving full elimination of many pathogens causing CVBDs from infected animals is often impossible even when they are clinically cured, dogs once exposed to CVBDs can remain as lifetime reservoirs of disease for both other animals and humans in the close vicinity, and should therefore be treated with preventative medications to minimise the risk of pathogen transmission by the competent vectors.

Brianti;Feline and canine leishmaniosis and other vector-borne diseases in the Aeolian Islands: Pathogen and vector circulation in a confined environment;"Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) are prevalently investigated in dogs. Studies on feline VBDs are scant, though feline leishmaniosis (FeL) is increasingly recognised as a disease of cats in endemic areas. Comprehensive investigations on the distribution of VBDs in populations of cats and dogs living in relatively small geographical areas, such as islands, are currently lacking. In this study the prevalence of Leishmania infantum and other VBD pathogens was assessed in cohorts of cats and dogs living in the Aeolian Islands. Autochthonous animals (330 cats and 263 dogs) of different age and sex were sampled. Blood and conjunctival samples were collected from cats and dogs for serological and molecular testing. Eighty-five (25.8%) cats were positive for L. infantum, 13 (3.9%) for Bartonella spp. and 1 (0.3%) for Hepatozoon felis. One-hundred and ten dogs (41.8%) were positive for L. infantum and three (1.1%) for Hepatozoon canis. The incidence of L. infantum infection in cats positive after one season of exposure to sand fly was 14.7%. Leishmania infantum prevalence and year incidence were higher in dogs than in cats (pÂ =Â 0.0001 and pÂ =Â 0.0003, respectively). Thirty-four cats (10.3%) scored positive for ticks (mean intensity rate of infestation, 2.03Â Â±Â 1.4), which were identified to the species level as Ixodes ventalloi and Rhipicephalus pusillus. Conversely, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l.) was the only species identified in dogs (10.6%). A larger prevalence of infestation by Ctenocephalides felis was recorded in cats (nÂ =Â 91; 27.6%) than in dogs (nÂ =Â 33; 12.5%) (pÂ =Â 0.0001). In addition, one female Nosopsyllus fasciatus (syn. Ceratophyllus fasciatus) and one male Spilopsyllus cuniculi were also identified in flea-infected cats. VBDs are endemic in the Aeolian Islands being L. infantum the most prevalent vector-borne pathogen circulating between cats and dogs. The overall seroprevalence of FeL herein recorded is higher than that assessed, only by IFAT, in populations of cats in Greece and in Spain. Because L. infantum and VBDs are more commonly associated with dogs, the recognition of cats as hosts of different vector-borne pathogens is of paramount importance towards a better management of these diseases in both animals and humans.

This study aimed to evaluate certain VBP in samples from dogs with splenic lesions. Methods: Seventy-seven EDTA-blood and 64 splenic tissue samples were collected from 78 dogs with splenic disease in a Mediterranean area. Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp., Hepatozoon canis, Leishmania infantum, hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. and Rickettsia spp. were targeted using PCR assays. Sixty EDTA-blood samples from dogs without evidence of splenic lesions were included as a control group. Results: More than half (51.56%) of the biopsies (33/64) were consistent with benign lesions and 48.43% (31/64) with malignancy, mostly hemangiosarcoma (25/31). PCR yielded positive results in 13 dogs with spleen alterations (16.67%), for Babesia canis (n = 3), Babesia gibsoni (n = 2), hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. (n = 2), Rickettsia massiliae (n = 1) and ""Babesia vulpes"" (n = 1), in blood; and for B. canis, B. gibsoni, Ehrlichia canis and L. infantum (n = 1 each), in spleen. Two control dogs (3.3%) were positive for B. gibsoni and H. canis (n = 1 each). Benign lesions were detected in the 61.54% of infected dogs (8/13); the remaining 38.46% were diagnosed with malignancies (5/13). Infection was significantly associated to the presence of splenic disease (P = 0.013). There was no difference in the prevalence of infection between dogs with benign and malignant splenic lesions (P = 0.69); however B. canis was more prevalent in dogs with hemangiosarcoma (P = 0.006). Conclusions: VBP infection could be involved in the pathogenesis of splenic disease. The immunological role of the spleen could predispose to alterations of this organ in infected dogs. Interestingly, all dogs with B. canis infection were diagnosed with hemangiosarcoma in the present survey. As previously reported, results support that VBP diagnosis could be improved by analysis of samples from different tissues. The sample size included here warrants further investigation.

Tasker;Prevalence study and risk factor analysis of selected bacterial, protozoal and viral, including vector-borne, pathogens in cats from Cyprus;"Background: Feline infectious agent studies are lacking in Cyprus. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence and risk factors for various feline infectious agents, including feline vector-borne pathogens (FVBP), in cats from Cyprus. Methods: A cross-sectional, descriptive, multicentre study was performed on 174 feline samples [138 owned and 36 shelter-feral, including both healthy (43) and non-healthy (131), cats] from private veterinary clinics from all six districts of Cyprus. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were used to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), ""Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum"" (CMhm) and ""Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis"" (CMt). The population was tested for four FVBP including Bartonella henselae and Leishmania spp. using qPCR, while conventional PCR assays were used to detect Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Serological assays were performed to detect Leishmania infantum antibodies, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies. Statistical analysis was performed to test associations and possible risk factors between variables and infectious agents. Results: Ninety-six (55.2%) of the 174 cats were PCR-positive for at least one infectious agent. Forty-six cats (26.4%) were haemoplasma positive, including 13 (7.5%) for Mhf, 36 (20.7%) for CMhm and 12 (6.9%) for CMt. Sixty-six cats (37.9%) were positive for Hepatozoon spp., while 19 (10.9%) were positive for B. henselae, four (2.3%) for Leishmania spp. and one (0.6%) for Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. Sequencing revealed the presence of Hepatozoon felis, L. infantum and Anaplasma platys. Of the 164 cats that underwent retroviral serology, 10 (6.1%) were FeLV-positive and 31 (18.9%) were FIV-positive, while L. infantum serology was positive in 7 (4.4%) of the 160 cats tested. Multivariable logistic regression revealed significant associations for various infectious agents including L. infantum with each of Hepatozoon spp. and CMt infection. Conclusions: A high prevalence of infectious agents was found in cats from Cyprus with Mhf, CMhm, CMt, L. infantum, B. henselae, H. felis, A. platys, FeLV and FIV infections reported for the first time. The significant associations between different pathogens provide a better understanding of similarities in the epidemiology of these pathogens and interactions between them.

Diallo, A. Sow, P.M. Sembene, O. Faye, B. El Kouri, M.L. Sidi, A.A. Sall;Detection of the Northeastern African Rift Valley fever virus lineage during the 2015 outbreak in Mauritania;Background. Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute viral anthropozoonosis that causes epizootics and epidemics among livestock population and humans. Multiple emergences and reemergences of the virus have occurred in Mauritania over the last decade. This article describes the outbreak that occurred in 2015 in Mauritania and reports the results of serological and molecular investigations of blood samples collected from suspected RVF patients. Methods. An RVF outbreak was reported from 14 September to 26 November 2015 in Mauritania. Overall, 184 suspected cases from different localities were identified by 26 health facilities. Blood samples were collected and tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Institut Pasteur de Dakar (IPD). Sequencing of partial genomes and phylogenetic analyses were performed on RT-PCR-positive samples. As part of routine surveillance at IPD, samples were also screened for dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, Zika, and Chikungunya viruses by ELISA and RT-PCR. Results. Of the 184 suspected cases, there were 57 confirmed cases and 12 deaths. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences indicated an emergence of a virus that originated from Northeastern Africa. Our results show co-circulation of other arboviruses in Mauritania-dengue, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever, and West Nile viruses. Conclusion. The Northeastern Africa lineage of RVF was responsible for the outbreak in Mauritania in 2015. Co-circulation of multiples arboviruses was detected. This calls for systematic differential diagnosis and highlights the need to strengthen arbovirus surveillance in Africa.

In this study, dogs from Islamabad, Lahore, and Multan Districts of the Punjab region of Pakistan were surveyed to investigate the presence and prevalence of H. canis infection and to determine the effects of the parasite on hematological parameters. Blood samples were collected from 151 domestic dogs (149 pet, 2 stray) of both sexes and varying ages. Data on sex, age, tick infestation, and clinical factors (body temperature, mucous membrane status, and presence of hematuria and vomiting) were collected. Using PCR, 18 dogs (11.9%) were found positive for the presence of H. canis DNA. Partial sequences of the 18S rRNA gene shared 99-100% similarity with the corresponding H. canis isolates. This epidemiological survey revealed higher prevalence of H. canis in Islamabad (11/49, 22.4%) compared to Lahore (3/52, 5.8%) and Multan (4/50, 8%) in Pakistan. No investigated epidemiological or clinical factors were found to be associated with the presence of H. canis (p > 0.05) in dogs. H. canis positive dogs exhibited higher minimum inhibitory dilution (p = 0.04), mixed inclusion (p = 0.008) and relative distribution width of red blood cells (p = 0.02), and lower hematocrit (p = 0.03) and mean hemoglobin content (p = 0.03) than did dogs in which H. canis was not detected. We are recommending this PCR-based protocol to the veterinary practitioners for the detection and/or confirmation of H. canis in dogs suspected for hepatozoonosis to improve their health status.

Solymosi, R. Farkas;First detection of tick-borne pathogens of dogs from Malta;"The knowledge about the vector-borne infections in domestic dogs has been increasing worldwide. However no studies have been done on hard tick infestation and tick-borne pathogens (TBPs) of dogs present in Malta. Therefore, a total of 99 dogs was selected and inspected between March and July 2013 in 18 urban and 17 rural areas on the islands of Malta and Gozo. All ticks were removed from the dogs and identified. Blood samples were taken and tested for protozoa (Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp.) and bacteria (Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp., Rickettsia spp.) by conventional PCR. All of the ticks collected from 34 (34.3%; 95% CI: 26â€“44) dogs belong to the species Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato. Tick infestation on the farm dogs was significantly higher than that of dogs kept outdoors as pets (OR: 15.19, 95% CI: 2.72â€“118.92, pÂ <Â 0.001) or in a sanctuary (OR: 35.11, 95% CI: 3.20â€“1986.67, pÂ <Â 0.001). Altogether 22 animals were infected with one or two TBPs, most of them with Hepatozoon canis (16/22; 72.7%). Anaplasma platys and Babesia vogeli were detected in 5 and 4 dogs, respectively. Three dogs had co-infections caused by H. canis and A. platys. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on tick infestation and TBPs of dogs in Malta.

Hakimmipour, N.G. Pourafshar;Feline visceral leishmaniasis in Kerman, southeast of Iran: Serological and molecular study;Background & objectives: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a fatal zoonotic disease in tropical and sub-tropical countries including Iran. Dogs constitute the main domestic reservoir for VL (kala-azar) in Iran but incidence of the disease in cats from Fars and East Azerbaijan provinces has led to propose them as secondary reservoirs, and possible expansion of the feline role in the transmission of disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection in stray cats in Kerman City by ELISA and PCR methods. Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 60 stray cats were randomly live trapped from different parts of Kerman City during a six month period between March and September 2014. About 3 ml blood samples were drawn from jugular vein of captured cats and a detailed questionnaire about demographic characteristics and clinical status of each cat was recorded by attending veterinarian. The complete blood counts and biochemistry analysis were performed for all cats. Finally collected sera samples were tested by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit and PCR amplification method. Results: Prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection was 6.7 and 16.7% by ELISA and PCR assays, respectively. Infection rate was significantly higher in leukopenic cats, which were older than 3 yr. Interpretation & conclusion: The results of the study indicate that stray cats are at risk of L. infantum infection in Kerman City. Further, studies are required to elucidate the role of cats as potential reservoir host in the epidemiology of VL in endemic regions. Â© 2017, Malaria Research Center.

DeRisi;Acute West Nile Virus Meningoencephalitis Diagnosed Via Metagenomic Deep Sequencing of Cerebrospinal Fluid in a Renal Transplant Patient;Solid organ transplant patients are vulnerable to suffering neurologic complications from a wide array of viral infections and can be sentinels in the population who are first to get serious complications from emerging infections like the recent waves of arboviruses, including West Nile virus, Chikungunya virus, Zika virus, and Dengue virus. The diverse and rapidly changing landscape of possible causes of viral encephalitis poses great challenges for traditional candidate-based infectious disease diagnostics that already fail to identify a causative pathogen in approximately 50% of encephalitis cases. We present the case of a 14-year-old girl on immunosuppression for a renal transplant who presented with acute meningoencephalitis. Traditional diagnostics failed to identify an etiology. RNA extracted from her cerebrospinal fluid was subjected to unbiased metagenomic deep sequencing, enhanced with the use of a Cas9-based technique for host depletion. This analysis identified West Nile virus (WNV). Convalescent serum serologies subsequently confirmed WNV seroconversion. These results support a clear clinical role for metagenomic deep sequencing in the setting of suspected viral encephalitis, especially in the context of the high-risk transplant patient population.

Shapiro, F. de Almeida Borges;Molecular characterization of Leishmania infantum in domestic cats in a region of Brazil endemic for human and canine visceral leishmaniasis;Leishmaniasis is a â€œneglected tropical diseaseâ€ and serious public health issue in Brazil. While dogs are recognized as particularly important reservoirs, recent reports of domestic cats infected with Leishmania sp. in urban areas suggest their participation in the epidemiological chain of the parasite in endemic areas. The aim of this study was to screen domestic cats for Leishmania sp. infection in an area where human and canine visceral leishmaniasis are endemic, followed by the identification of the species circulating in cats. We collected peripheral blood, lymph-node aspirates and bone marrow from 100 adult animals, both male and female, and analyzed the samples using cytological and molecular (PCR) detection techniques. We detected Leishmania in 6% of animals, which were then analyzed by RFLP-PCR to identify the species. Leishmania infantum (synonym: L. chagasi), a species responsible for visceral leishmaniasis in humans and other animals, was identified from all six samples. Amastigotes were observed in the peripheral blood, bone marrow and lymph-node aspirates in 4 of the 6 PCR-positive animals. The presence of infected cats in endemic areas should not be neglected, because it demonstrates the potential role of these animals in the biological cycle of the pathogen.

TÃ¶z;The new situation of cutaneous leishmaniasis after Syrian civil war in Gaziantep city, Southeastern region of Turkey;Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an important public health problem with around 2.000 autochthonous reported cases each year in Turkey. Due to the civil war in Syria, Turkey received around three million refugees and they are mainly located at either camps or homes in south/southeastern part of Turkey. In the present study, we aimed to collect samples from CL suspected patients admitting to State Hospital in Gaziantep City and perform parasitological and DNA-based techniques for diagnosis as well as species identification of the parasite for better understanding the prevalence of each species among Turkish and Syrian patients in the region. The collection of samples was carried out between January 2009 and July 2015. The lesion aspiration samples were taken and stained with Giemsa stain followed by microscopical examination for parasitological diagnosis. After the DNA extraction from Giemsa stained slides, real time and semi-nested PCRs both targeting ITS1 region were performed for molecular diagnosis and species identification. A total of 567 people were admitted to the hospital with the suspicion of CL and 263 (46.4%) of them were found to be positive by parasitological examination. One hundred seventy-four (66.15%), 88 (33.46%) and 1 (0.38%) of them were Turkish, Syrians and Afghan, respectively. Slide samples obtained from 34 CL suspected patients were analyzed by PCR and 20 of them were found positive. Eighteen (13 Turkish and 13 Syrians) of the positive samples were identified as L. tropica, while two (1 Turkish and 1 Syrian) of them were L. infantum. In conclusion, the effects of Syrian civil war on the epidemiology of CL in Gaziantep city is demonstrated in the present study. The use of molecular tool in the diagnosis of leishmaniasis is effective, sensitive and time saving which will enable the species typing. Species typing of the causative agent in endemic areas will bring valuable data to epidemiological knowledge.

Traversa;Intestinal parasites and vector-borne pathogens in stray and free-roaming cats living in continental and insular Greece;This survey investigated the distribution of various intestinal parasites and vector-borne pathogens in stray and free-roaming cats living in four regions of Greece. A total number of one hundred and fifty cats living in three Islands (Crete, Mykonos and Skopelos) and in Athens municipality was established as a realistic aim to be accomplished in the study areas. All cats were examined with different microscopic, serological and molecular assays aiming at evaluating the occurrence of intestinal parasites, and exposure to or presence of vector-borne infections. A total of 135 cats (90%) was positive for one or more parasites and/or pathogens transmitted by ectoparasites. Forty-four (29.3%) cats were positive for one single infection, while 91 (60.7%) for more than one pathogen. A high number of (n. 53) multiple infections caused by feline intestinal and vector-borne agents including at least one zoonotic pathogen was detected. Among them, the most frequently recorded helminths were roundworms (Toxocara cati, 24%) and Dipylidium caninum (2%), while a high number of examined animals (58.8%) had seroreaction for Bartonella spp., followed by Rickettsia spp. (43.2%) and Leishmania infantum (6.1%). DNA-based assays revealed the zoonotic arthropod-borne organisms Bartonella henselae, Bartonella clarridgeiae, Rickettsia spp., and L. infantum. These results show that free-ranging cats living in areas of Greece under examination may be exposed to a plethora of internal parasites and vector-borne pathogens, some of them potentially able to infect humans. Therefore, epidemiological vigilance and appropriate control measures are crucial for the prevention and control of these infections and to minimize the risk of infection for people.

Molaei;Molecular detection of hepatozoon canis in dogs of Ardabil Province, Northwest of Iran;Hepatozoon species are protozoan parasites that infect some animals such as birds, reptiles, amphibians, and carnivores. Previous studies performed on canine hepatozoonosis in Iran have never used molecular techniques for diagnosis of this disease. The main objective of the present study was to detect Hepatozoon canis in the blood of dogs using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and sequencing. A total of 104 blood samples were collected from dogs of Meshginshahr County (Ardabil Province), and DNA was extracted from blood samples by dint of DNG-plus Extraction Kit. Then, 18S rRNA gene was amplified by using the conventional PCR methods. PCR products yielded an amplicon of the approximate length of 897 bp for all the positive samples. Twenty-four out of the 104 (23.07%) samples were found to be positive for H. canis. This rate of infection is relatively high among dogs in Ardabil Province.

Scofield;Leishmania infantum infection in dogs from maroon communities in the Eastern Amazon;This study was designed to detect L. infantum infection in dogs and to evaluate the factors associated with canine visceral leishmaniasis in the maroon communities of Menino Jesus de Petimandeua and Itaboca in the municipality of Inhangapi, ParÃ¡, Brazil. Whole blood and intact skin samples were collected from 143 dogs, and a questionnaire was applied. L. infantum DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers RV1 and RV2. Collection sites were georeferenced to obtain a spatial distribution of the residences visited and infected dogs. L. infantum DNA was detected in 8.4% (12/143) of the skin samples and in 1.4% (2/143) of the blood samples. On the risk map, three clusters were observed in Itaboca and one was observed in Menino Jesus de Petimandeua. We observed that most of the inhabitants in these maroon communities live close to forested areas and do not use protection against insect vectors. The presence of canine reservoirs of L. infantum associated to environment characteristics (preserved forests and deforested areas) and habits of dog owners (living near forested areas and not using any protection against insects) may favor the transmission of L. infantum in the studied areas.

Sukumolanan, A. Phosri;Molecular detection of blood pathogens and their impacts on levels of packed cell volume in stray dogs from Thailand;Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of blood parasite infection in stray dogs by PCR technique and the association between levels of packed cell volume (PCV) and blood parasitic infection in stray dogs. Methods: A total of 65 blood samples were collected from stray dogs in animal quarantine station from Mahasarakham, Thailand to evaluate the levels of PCV before molecular screening for tick-borne pathogens infection. Results: Stray dogs were positive with one or more pathogens in 44 (67.69%) out of 65 blood samples. Ehrlichia canis [43.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 38.1-48.1] was the most common blood pathogen found infecting in stray dogs in Mahasarakham Province, followed by Anaplasma platys (29.2%, 95% CI: 24.2-34.2), Hepatozoon canis (12.3%, 95% CI: 7.3-17.3) and Babesia canis vogeli (6.2%, 95% CI: 1.2-11.2), respectively. Moreover, co-infections with two pathogens were identified in 11 (16.9%) of dogs examined and two (2.9%) dogs were coinfections with three pathogens. Statistically significant relationship between the PCV levels and Ehrlichia canis infection was found (P < 0.05). Conclusions: This study indicated that blood pathogens are spreading in stray dogs and they are potentially high risk of agent transmission to human via exposure with tick vectors. It was also the first report of Anaplasma platys infection in dogs in north-eastern part of Thailand.

Characterization of such diseases in the Philippines remains incomplete, thus, it is necessary to obtain additional information on the prevalence and diversity of canine tick-borne diseases in the country. In this study, blood samples were obtained at two veterinary clinics in Metro Manila, Philippines from 114 dogs suspected of having canine tick-borne pathogens. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on whole blood DNA extracts followed by sequencing, and the following pathogens were detected: Hepatozoon (H.) canis (5.26%), Babesia (B.) vogeli (5.26%), Ehrlichia (E.) canis (4.39%), and Anaplasma platys (3.51%). Additionally, a set of multiplex PCR primers were developed to detect H. canis, Babesia spp. (B. canis and B. vogeli), and E. canis in canine blood. Multiplex and conventional single-reaction PCR results for the 114 dog blood samples were similar, except for one H. canis sample. Multiplex PCR is, therefore, a useful tool in screening infected dogs in veterinary clinics. This study's results, together with those of previous studies in the country, show that canine vector-borne pathogens are an emerging veterinary concern in the Philippines.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;10.14405/kjvr.2017.57.2.79;;;;88;;;;;;;2;Korean Journal of Veterinary Research;Canine vector-borne diseases,Dogs,Molecular detection,Multiplex polymerase chain reaction,Philippines;;Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;79;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021733231&doi=10.14405%2fkjvr.2017.57.2.79&partnerID=40&md5=a356e48837f77d638fbdd16d57be943c;57;2017;Paul.Gale;3;Hepatozoon canis

Canine babesiosis has, to date, only been reported in the Czech Republic as an imported disease, despite the presence of an established population of D. reticulatus in the South Moravian region. A recent report of autochthonous H. canis in dogs indicates that the spectrum of tick-borne diseases in dogs in the Czech Republic may be broader than previously expected and that a survey of a large set of dogs may be required. The aim of the present study was to survey the spectrum of tick-borne apicomplexan parasites infecting dogs in the Czech Republic and to assess the autochthonous character of detected infections. In the present study, we surveyed the spectrum of tick-borne protists in 418 dogs in the Czech Republic using PCR-based detection of the 18S rDNA gene of piroplasms and H. canis. We confirmed the presence of H. canis (4%), B. canis (1%, including the autochthonous cases) and a single imported case of B. gibsoni (0.2%) infection in sampled animals. Our results indicate that these pathogens deserve closer attention from veterinarian practitioners.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;10.17221/152/2016-VETMED;;;;146;;;;;;;3;Veterinarni Medicina;18S rDNA,Apicomplexan parasites,PCR detection,Tick-borne diseases;;Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;138;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016228737&doi=10.17221%2f152%2f2016-VETMED&partnerID=40&md5=99da255d040f20eb2318fc448db1722a;62;2017;Paul.Gale;3;Hepatozoon canis

Lockwood;Case report: Old world mucosal leishmaniasis: report of five imported cases to the hospital for tropical diseases, London, United Kingdom;Old World species of Leishmania typically cause visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis. Mucosal involvement is typically seen with infection by Leishmania species found in South America, usually after the healing of cutaneous leishmaniasis. We present five imported cases of mucosal leishmaniasis caused by Old World Mediterranean Leishmania infantum exclusively affecting the nasal mucosa or vocal cord. In only one case was there a recollection of a preceding cutaneous lesion compatible with cutaneous Leishmaniasis. Of significance was that four out of five cases were receiving local corticosteroids for chronic lung disorders and four were systemically immunosuppressed. This report highlights the importance of considering mucosal leishmaniasis in the differential diagnosis in those presenting with upper respiratory tract mucosal lesions with a relevant travel history to the Mediterranean and in whom malignancy has been excluded.

Soares;Serodiagnosis of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in human and canine populations living in indigenous reserves in the Brazilian Amazon Region;Introduction: Leishmaniasis is endemic to the Northern, Northeastern, Central-Western, and Southeastern regions of Brazil. We aimed to assess the epidemiological situation of leishmaniasis in humans and dogs in indigenous villages located in the States of Mato Grosso and Tocantins using a serological survey conducted in May 2011. Methods: Serum samples were collected from 470 humans and 327 dogs living in villages of the Urubu Branco and TapirapÃ© KarajÃ¡ indigenous reserves. The samples were analyzed for the presence of Leishmania spp. antibodies using the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a crude antigen (CA) and soluble antigen (SA), and Dual Path Platform (DPPÂ®) immunoassay for canine visceral leishmaniasis. Results: Of 470 human samples tested, two (0.4%) were positive using IFAT. Among 327 dog samples tested, 28 (8.6%) were positive using ELISA CA, five (1.5%) using ELISA SA, two (0.6%) using IFAT, and none using DPPÂ® immunoassay with Leishmania infantum chagasi antigen. When Leishmania amazonensis antigen was used, 20 (6.1%) samples were positive using ELISA CA and four (1.2%) using IFAT. Conclusions: There was a low prevalence of infection in the region, and significant differences among the main serological methods used for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis. These findings indicated that the detection of Leishmania spp. requires further study and improvement. Â© 2017, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

Methods: This descriptive cross- sectional study was conducted on children up to 12yr old of nomadic tribes from Pars Abad County, Ardabil Province, Iran in 2015. For each individual, a questionnaire including age, sex, clinical manifestations, history of disease, and contact with reservoir hosts of VL were completed, separately. To determine VL seroprevalence, blood samples were collected from the children and after centrifugation, the plasma samples were tested using Direct Agglutination Test (DAT) for detection of anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS16. Results: From 776 children up to 12yr old, 2 (0.25%) showed anti-L. infantum antibodies at titers 1:1600 and only one case (0.13%) showed anti-Leishmania antibodies at titers 1:3200. The child with anti-L. infantum antibodies titers of 1:3200 showed mild fever for more than 2 months period, paleness, weakness and mild splenomegaly. After physical examination and confirmation of VL (kala-azar), the patient was treated with antileishmanial drugs. Conclusion: The findings indicated that L. infantum infection is being circulated with low prevalence in nomadic tribes of Pars Abad but it is necessary that the surveillance system is regularly monitored among physicians and public health managers in the studied areas.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;;;;;337;;;;;;;2;Journal of Arthropod-Borne Diseases;Children,Iran,Nomadic tribes,Sero-prevalence,Visceral leishmaniasis,meglumine antimonate,mercaptoethanol,agglutination test,Article,blood sampling,child,controlled study,cross-sectional study,descriptive research,female,fever,human,Iran,Leishmania infantum,male,observational study,pallor,physical examination,questionnaire,sensitivity and specificity,seroprevalence,splenomegaly,visceral leishmaniasis,weakness;;Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;331;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020392441&partnerID=40&md5=f394e19ebbf824f876de032f7eebd07e;11;2017;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Donoghue;Leprosy associated with atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis in Nicaragua and Honduras;In Central America, few cases of leprosy have been reported, but the disease may be unrecognized. Diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and histology. Preliminary field work in Nicaragua and Honduras found patients, including many children, with skin lesions clinically suggestive of atypical cutaneous leishmaniasis or indeterminate leprosy. Histology could not distinguish these diseases although acid-fast organisms were visible in a few biopsies. Lesions healed after standard antimicrobial therapy for leprosy. In the present study, patients, family members, and other community members were skin-tested and provided nasal swabs and blood samples. Biopsies were taken from a subgroup of patients with clinical signs of infection. Two laboratories analyzed samples, using local in-house techniques. Mycobacterium leprae, Leishmania spp. and Leishmania infantum were detected using polymerase chain reactions. Mycobacterium leprae DNA was detected in blood samples and nasal swabs, including some cases where leprosy was not clinically suspected. Leishmania spp. were also detected in blood and nasal swabs. Most biopsies contained LeishmaniaDNAand coinfection of Leishmania spp. with M. leprae occurred in33%of cases. Mycobacterium lepraeDNA was also detected and sequenced from Nicaraguan and Honduran environmental samples. In conclusion, leprosy and leishmaniasis are present in both regions, and leprosy appears to be widespread. The nature of any relationship between these two pathogens and the epidemiology of these infections need to be elucidated.

A total of 429 dogs were sampled in three areas of the Pantanal biome, including the municipalities of PoconÃ©, Santo AntÃ´nio de Leverger, and BarÃ£o de MelgaÃ§o, in the state of Mato Grosso, and in the municipality of CorumbÃ¡, in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. The immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was used to detect antibodies (cut-off point 40) using Leishmania infantum chagasi antigen. Because of the possibility of cross-reactivity between species of the genus Leishmania, samples that were positive in the IFA against L. infantum chagasi were also tested by IFA in the same conditions, using L. amazonensis and L. braziliensis antigens. IFA-positive samples to L. infantum chagasi were also evaluated using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The results showed the presence of antibodies against L. infantum chagasi in 23 (5.36%; 95% CI: 3.50%-8.05%) dogs and at least one seroreactive dog was found in each of the municipalities evaluated in this study. Antibody titers ranged from 40 to 5,120, and all IFA positive samples were positive in the ELISA. Among the 23 positive dogs, nine were also were seroreactive for L. amazonensis and L. braziliensis antigens. The occurrence of anti- L. infantum chagasi antibodies in dogs was higher in rural areas (7.06%) than in urban areas (2.50%) (P < 0.05). Based on this study, we concluded that dogs from rural areas of the Pantanal wetlands were in contact with Leishmania species, which is relevant information given their importance to public health.

Ã–zbel;Evaluation of conjunctival swab sampling in the diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis: A two-year follow-up study in Ã‡ukurova Plain, Turkey;"The diagnosis of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs is a very important and problematic public health issue in Turkey. A longitudinal study was carried out on dogs in selected villages in the Ã‡ukurova Plain in Turkey, from July 2011 to June 2013, where cutaneous (CL) and visceral (VL) leishmaniasis is endemic. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of CanL and to evaluate the early diagnostic performance of the non-invasive conjunctival swab nested PCR (CS n-PCR) test in comparison with the Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT). The consecutive blood and CS samples from a representative number of dogs (80-100 dogs/each survey) were collected in a cohort of 6 villages located in the area. Clinical symptoms, demographic and physical features about each dog were noted and lymph node aspiration samples were obtained from selected dogs with lymphadenopathy. In four surveys during the period, a total of 338 sets (blood and CS) of samples from 206 dogs were obtained, such that 83 dogs were sampled more than once. In the cross-sectional analysis, the CanL prevalence was found to be 27.18% (between 7.14% and 39.13%) by IFAT and 41.74% (between 29.03% and 46.66%) by CS n-PCR. The isolated strains were identified as Leishmania infantum MON-1 (n = 9) and MON-98 (n = 2) by MLEE analysis. Genetic studies targeting the Hsp70 and ITS1 regions performed on 11 dog isolates also showed two clear separate groups. According to IFAT results, 24 of the 83 dogs sampled more than once showed seroconversion (n = 19) or a four-fold increase in Ab titers (n = 5), while 17 were positive in the initial screening. Forty-two dogs stayed negative during the whole period. The natural Leishmania exposure rate was detected as 31.14% in the study area. CS n-PCR only detected Leishmania infection earlier than IFAT in 8 dogs. No statistical difference was found after the analysis of demographical and physical data. The results indicated that (i) circulation of the dog population is very common in settlements in the Ã‡ukurova Plain, but the disease prevalence is high and stable, (ii) the performance of CS n-PCR for detecting Leishmania-dog contact is higher than IFAT, (iii) and some of the parasites isolated from dogs have different zymodemes and/or genotypes from previous human and sand fly isolates; suggesting the probability of two different cycles of leishmaniasis in this particular area. This hypothesis should be supported by future studies targeting vectors and reservoirs.

Steinman;Low seroprevalence of leishmania infantum and toxoplasma gondii in the horse population in Israel;"A cross-sectional investigation was done on the seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum and Toxoplasma gondii infection among apparently healthy horses in Israel. This survey included 383 horses distributed in 22 farms throughout Israel during the years 2011-2013. Serum samples were tested for the presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using the direct agglutination test (DAT) specific to Leishmania and by the modified agglutination test (MAT) for the presence of IgG antibodies to T. gondii. Low seroprevalences were detected for both L. infantum and T. gondii in the horse population in Israel; of the 338 horses tested, 6 (1.4%) were found to be seropositive for L. infantum and 11 (2.5%) for T. gondii, with no significant association between seroprevalence and demographic/environmental factors. An ongoing geographical expansion of L. infantum, previously reported in humans and dogs in Israel, was also supported by our results in horses. Here we present evidence of exposure of horses to L. infantum and T. gondii in Israel. Continuous seroprevalence surveillance in horses, such as the one performed in this study, might further elucidate the eco-epidemiology of these two important zoonotic parasites in this country.

Marcili;Environmental factors and ecosystems associated with canine visceral leishmaniasis in Northeastern Brazil;Environment influences the composition, distribution, and behavior of the vectors and mammalian hosts involved in the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), affecting the epidemiology of the disease. In Brazil, the urbanization process and canine cases of VL are indicators for local health authorities. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of the canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in MaranhÃ£o State, Brazil. Blood samples collected from 960 dogs from six municipalities and six different ecosystems (Baixada Maranhense, Mangue, Mata dos Cocais, AmazÃ´nia, Cerrado, and Restinga) to serological tests (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA], indirect fluorescence antibody test [IFAT], and chromatographic immunoassay methods [Dual Path Platform technology, DPPÂ®]) and parasitological diagnosis. From serological tests, 11.14% (107) of the dogs were positive for CVL, with 59.16% (568), 14.5% (148), and 131% (126) positives to ELISA, DPP, and IFAT tests, respectively. Only seven animals (0.73%) were positive in a parasitological test. We also performed parasite isolation and phylogenetic characterization. All isolates of dogs obtained from MaranhÃ£o were grouped in a single branch with Leishmania infantum chagasi from Brazil. The ecosystem Amazonia presented the highest positivity rates to CVL in serological and parasitological tests. Brazilian biomes/ecosystems suffer large degradation and may favor, depending on climatic conditions, the installation of new diseases. In the case of VL, dogs are reservoirs of parasites and sentinels for human infection.

In Puerto IguazÃº City (Misiones province, Argentina), human and canine cases of VL were recorded. Additionally, in the rural area known as ""2000 HectÃ¡reas"", less than 10 km away from the city, several human cases of Tegumentary Leishmaniasis (TL) were registered determining an endemic area with Leishmania braziliensis as the etiological agent. Because of this, several phlebotomine captures were done in this site showing that Nyssomyia whitmani is the most abundant sandfly followed by Migonemyia migonei. In this study, three of the sandflies captured were found infected whit L. infantum parasites, detected by PCR and sequencing. Two of them were N. whitmani and the other one was a M. migonei specimen, being this the first report of L. infantum natural infection for Argentina in these sandfly species. N. whitmani is the main vector of L. braziliensis in this area, and M. migonei has been suggested as a putative vector in other locations where human and canine cases of VL where reported with L. longipalpis apparently absent. In this context, we consider necessary further studies that could define the role of M. migonei and N. whitmani as specific or permissive vectors of L. infantum, their vectorial competence and capacity, and their actual role in the transmission of both Tegumentary and Visceral Leishmaniasis in the study area.

Tolezano;The shadows of a ghost: A survey of canine leishmaniasis in Presidente Prudente and its spatial dispersion in the western region of SÃ£o Paulo state, an emerging focus of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil;Background: Visceral leishmaniasis is an emerging zoonosis and its geographic distribution is restricted to tropical and temperate regions. Most of the individuals infected in Latin America are in Brazil. Despite the control measures that have been adopted, the disease is spreading throughout new regions of the country. Domestic dogs are involved in the transmission cycle and are considered to be the main epidemiologic reservoir of Leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi). Our aim was to determine the prevalence of canine leishmaniasis (CL) and Ehrlichiosis infection in Presidente Prudente as well as the spatial dispersion of the disease in the western region of SÃ£o Paulo state. Methods: Dogs underwent clinical examination and symptoms related to CL were recorded. Anti- Leishmania antibodies were detected using ELISA, rK39-immunocromatographic tests (DPP), and an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Anti-E. canis antibodies were detected by IFAT. A follow-up was conducted in dogs that were positive in the ELISA at the baseline study. Data on the spatial distribution of L. longipalpis and CL in SÃ£o Paulo state were obtained from Brazilian public health agencies. Results: Serum samples from 4547 dogs were analyzed. The seroprevalence of CL was 11.2 % by ELISA and 4.5 % by IFAT. In the follow-up, seroprevalence was 32.9 % by ELISA, 15.3 % by IFAT, 11.8 % by DPP test, and 66.5 % for E. canis. There was a significant positive association between Leishmania and E. canis infection (P < 0.0001). In the follow-up, clinical examinations revealed symptoms compatible with CL in 33.5 % of the dogs. L. longipalpis was found in 24 and CL in 15 counties of the Presidente Prudente mesoregion. The dispersion route followed the west frontier of SÃ£o Paulo state toward ParanÃ¡ state. Conclusions: Low CL and high ehrlichiosis prevalence rates were found in Presidente Prudente city. This emerging focus of CL is moving through the western region of SÃ£o Paulo state toward the border of ParanÃ¡ state. Integrated actions to fight the vector, parasites, infected dogs, and humans are needed to monitor the disease and implement strategies for epidemiologic control.

However, the epidemiology of the disease in this area is not well understood. An epidemiological survey was conducted in 2010 to identity the circulating parasite and the sand fly vector in the central provinces of Edlib and Hama. Methods: Sand fly specimens were collected using CDC light traps and identified morphologically. Total DNA was extracted from the abdomens of female specimens and from Giemsa-stained skin lesion smears of 80 patients. Leishmania parasites were first identified by sequencing the ITS1 gene amplicons. Then polymorphism analysis was performed using the RFLP technique. Results: A total of 2142 sand flies were collected. They belonged to eight species, among which Phlebotomus sergenti and Phlebotomus papatasi were the most predominant. L. tropica ITS1 gene was amplified from two pools of P. sergenti specimens and from skin smears of cutaneous leishmaniasis patients. This suggests that P. sergenti is the potential vector species in the study area. The digestion profiles of the obtained amplicons by TaqI restriction enzyme were identical for all analysed L. tropica parasites. Moreover, L. infantum ITS1 gene was amplified from two pools of Phlebotomus tobbi in the relatively humid zone of Edlib. Conclusions: L. tropica is confirmed to be the aetiological agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases in the central provinces. RFLP technique failed to show any genetic heterogeneity in the ITS1 gene among the tested parasites. The molecular detection of this parasite in human skin smears and in P. sergenti supports the vector status of this species in the study area. The detection of L. infantum in P. tobbi specimens indicates a potential circulation of this parasite in the humid zone of Edlib. Further epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate the burden of this visceral parasite in the study region.

Gulotta, L. Solano-Gallego;Ticks and associated pathogens collected from cats in Sicily and Calabria (Italy);Background: Limited information is available about the species of ticks infesting the cat and the pathogens that they harbor. The aims of the present study were to identify the species of ticks removed from cats living in Sicily and Calabria (Italy) and to detect DNA of vector-borne pathogens in the same ticks. Findings: Morphological identification of 132 adult ticks collected throughout the year from cats was carried out. Real-time PCRs for Hepatozoon felis, Piroplasmid, Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., Bartonella spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Leishmania infantum were performed from each individual tick. Ticks belonging to Rhipicephalus (R. sanguineus sensu lato, R. pusillus) and Ixodes (I. ricinus, I. ventalloi) genera were identified. Ixodes ventalloi was the most frequently found tick species (47 %). The positivity rate to at least one pathogen was 14.4 % (19/132 ticks). Leishmania infantum, Rickettsia spp. (R. monacensis and R. helvetica), Bartonella spp. (B. clarridgeiae), Piroplasmid (Babesia vogeli), and Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. (E. canis) DNAs were amplified in 8.3, 5.3, 1.5, 0.75 and 0.75 % of ticks, respectively. Hepatozoon felis, Anaplasma spp. and hemotropic Mycoplasma spp. DNAs were not detected. Four (21.1 %) out of nineteen positive ticks were co-infected. Conclusions: This study provides novel data about ticks infesting cats and the DNA of pathogens that they harbor. In Southern Italy, anti-tick prophylaxis should be implemented throughout the year in cats without neglecting winter time.

Wang;Molecular detection of vector-borne agents in dogs from ten provinces of China;"Background: Although many vector-borne agents are potential zoonoses and cause substantial morbidity and mortality in dogs worldwide, there are limited data on these organisms in dogs of China. Methods: Quantitative PCRs for vector-borne agents were performed to investigate their prevalences in convenience whole blood samples obtained from 1114 dogs from 21 veterinary clinics and a commercial dog breeding facility in ten provinces of China. In addition, the PCRs were performed on 146 Rhipicephalus sanguineus senso lato and 37 Linognathus setosus collected from dogs in the commercial dog breeding facility. Results: DNAs of Babesia gibsoni and B. vogeli (1.2 %), Ehrlichia canis (1.3 %), Hepatozoon canis (1.8 %) and Theileria orientalis (0.1 %) or a closely related organism were detected in the bloods of the dogs studied, and Babesia vogeli (3.4 %) and Ehrlichia canis (4.1 %) in R. sanguineus senso lato. The qPCRs for Anaplasma spp., Dirofilaria immitis and Leishmania spp. were negative for all blood samples, ticks and lice. At least one vector-borne agent was found in dogs from 5 of the 10 provinces investigated in this study. Overall, 4.4 % (49/1117) of the dogs studied were positive for at least one vector-borne agent with the prevalence being highest in the commercial breeding colony (24/97; 24.7 %). Conclusions: Our study confirms that B. vogeli, B. gibsoni, H. canis, and E. canis occur in China. Also, we present evidence that T. orientalis or a closely related organism can infect dogs.

Marco;Genetic and clinical characterization of canine leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum in northeastern Argentina;Leishmaniases comprise zoonotic diseases caused by protozoan flagellates of the Leishmania genus. They are endemic to South America, and the visceral form has been recently reported in Argentina. Dogs can play different roles in the Leishmania transmission cycles, depending mainly on the species of parasite involved. Here we focused on the clinical characterization of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in Northeast Argentina and on the molecular typing of its etiological agent. The nested polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of the Leishmania cytochrome b (cyt b) gene was performed on DNA templates purified from lymph nodes, bone marrow or spleen aspirates obtained from 48 dogs previously diagnosed by the observation of Leishmania amastigotes on smears from these aspirates. Their clinical and epidemiological data were also recorded. Systemic abnormalities were observed in 46 subjects (95.8%), most frequently lymphadenopathy, and emaciation (89.6 and 75%). Furthermore, 87% also presented tegumentary abnormalities, such as alopecia (54.2%) or secondary skin lesions (47.9%), among others. Twenty three dogs were positive for cyt b amplification. The sequence analysis showed the presence of two genotypes, LiA1 and LiA2, assigned to Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum, with 99.9 and 100% homology with the reference strain MHOM/TN/80/IPT1 respectively. LiA1 was identified in 18 cases (78.3%) and LiA2 in five (21.7%). Two cyt b variants of L. (L.) infantum were incriminated as the causative agents of CanL cases from three cities: Posadas, GarupÃ¡, and ItuzaingÃ³. All three cities are located in the northeastern area of the country, where these parasites seem to be spreading in urban areas.

Langoni;Antibodies to Leishmania spp. in domestic felines;Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne zoonotic disease caused by protozoa in the genus Leishmania, typical of rural and periâ€‘urban environments. The causative agent of American visceral leishmaniasis is Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi and the main insect vector in Brazil is Lutzomyia longipalpis. Dogs (Canis familiaris) are important in the transmission of the disease, as a reservoir closely related to humans and an infection source for phlebotomine vectors. Since 1990, an increasing number of feline leishmaniasis cases have been reported, suggesting that domestic cats (Felis catus) might be involved in the epidemiology of the disease. The present study analyzed the prevalence of anti-Leishmania spp. antibodies in naturally infected domestic cats from various neighborhoods in the municipality of BelÃ©m, ParÃ¡, Brazil, using the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and the direct agglutination test (DAT). Among the 443 samples tested, 18 (4.06%) presented positive reactions in the IFA. The observed titers were 40 IU in 4.97% of the samples and 80 IU in 0.90%. In the DAT test, positive results were found in 25 (5.64%) of the samples. The observed titers were also 40 IU (4.97%) and 80 IU (0.68%). The agreement rate between the two tests was considered low (Kappa coefficient = 0.10). Â© 2015, Brazilain Coll Veterinary Parasitology.

The disease is mainly transmitted by sand fly bites, but its transmission through transfusion in endemic areas may also occur. The current study aimed to determine the prevalence of Leishmania infection among blood donors in VL-endemic areas in south of Iran. A total of 2003 healthy blood donors from blood service centers in five VL-endemic districts in Fars province, southern Iran, were enrolled in the study. The blood samples were assessed for antibodies against Leishmania infantum by direct agglutination test (DAT). Seropositive subjects were tested for the presence of L. infantum DNA in their buffy coat by the molecular method. Socio-demographic features of the subjects were also documented during sample collecting. The mean age of participants was 36.3 (SDÂ =Â 10.7Â years). Male constituted 94.7Â % of the subjects while only 5.3Â % of donors were female. Twenty-eight blood donors (1.4Â %) were positive for Leishmania infection by DAT. Only one of these seropositive donors was positive for Leishmania infection by polymerase chain reaction. A significant correlation was found between age, the place of residence and seropositivity to Leishmania (PÂ <Â 0.05). Findings of this study revealed that the prevalence of Leishmania infection among blood donors in transfusion centers in the VL-endemic areas in Iran is relatively high. These asymptomatic blood donors may constitute a risk of transmitting of VL to susceptible recipients.

In the state of Rio de Janeiro, almost all of the cases of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) are caused by Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis, while cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are caused by Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi. The resurgence of autochthonous VL cases in Rio de Janeiro is related to the geographic expansion of the vector Lutzomyia longipalpis and its ability to adapt to urban areas. We report the first case of leishmaniasis with exclusively cutaneous manifestations caused by L. (L.) infantum chagasi in an urban area of Rio de Janeiro. An eighty-one-year-old woman presented three pleomorphic skin lesions that were not associated with systemic symptoms or visceromegalies. Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis identified L. (L.) infantum chagasi, but direct smear and PCR of bone narrow were negative for Leishmania sp. (suggesting exclusively cutaneous involvement). We discuss the different dermatological presentations of viscerotropic leishmaniasis of the New and Old World, and the clinical and epidemiological importance of the case. Etiologic diagnosis of ATL based upon exclusive clinical criteria may lead to incorrect conclusions. We should be aware of the constant changes in epidemiological patterns related to leishmaniases.

This study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of VL using direct agglutination test (DAT) in children living in rural districts of Alborz Province located 30 km from Tehran capital city of Iran. Multi-stage cluster random sampling was applied. Blood samples were randomly collected from 1,007 children under 10 years of age in the clusters. A total of 37 (3.7%) of the studied population showed anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies with titers of â‰¥1: 800. There was a significant association between positive sera and various parts of the rural areas of Alborz Province (P<0.002). Two children with anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies titers of â‰¥1:3,200 indicated kala-azar clinical features and treated with anti-leishmaniasis drugs in pediatric hospital. The findings of this study indicated that Leishmania infection is prevalent in rural areas of Alborz Province. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the awareness and alertness among physicians and public health managers, particularly in high-risk rural areas of the province in Iran.

Some of the CVBDs are zoonotic and may therefore also represent a risk for the human population. Different factors are in discussion to explain the expansion of vectors and pathogens into formerly unaffected areas. Knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of CVBDs in Bulgaria is scant overall and most data rely on single case descriptions. The aim of the present study was to determine the seroprevalence of important CVBDs in 167 dogs from central-southern Bulgaria (Stara Zagora), with special emphasis on hitherto uninvestigated babesiosis and angiostrongylosis, on poorly investigated Lyme borreliosis and canine granulocytic anaplasmosis, and on the potentially zoonotic dirofilariosis and leishmaniosis. Relatively high prevalence rates were documented for anti-Babesia canis antibodies, Dirofilaria immitis antigen (16.2 %; 27/167 each), anti-Ehrlichia canis (21 %; 35/167) and anti-Anaplasma phagocytophilum antibodies (30.5 â€“ 46.1 %; 51 â€“ 77/167), while Borrelia burgdorferi seroprevalence was low (2.4 %; 4/167). All samples were negative for Leishmania infantum antibodies and Angiostrongylus vasorum antigen and antibodies. In total, 64.7 % (108/167) of the samples indicated infection or exposure to at least one agent and a high proportion of dual infections (39.8 %; 43/108) was demonstrated. Multiple infections with up to four different organisms were also detected. Our data underline the importance of CVBDs and especially of co-infections which could influence the clinical outcome in dogs.

Dias;Epidemiological aspects of vector, parasite, and domestic reservoir in areas of recent transmission and no reported human cases of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil;About 97% of the human cases of the American visceral leishmaniasis (VL) occur in Brazil. In the last few years, the disease expanded to medium- and large-sized cities, in which surveillance and control actions have been intensified, in an effort to control VL spreading. Our two-year study was conducted in Belo Horizonte, the sixth most populous city in Brazil, which is endemic for VL. We focused in two particular districts of recent transmission of the disease, with no reported human cases and submitted to minor surveillance and control actions. Our aim was to draw an epidemiological profile of the local situation concerning Lutzomyia vector, Leishmania parasites, and the main domestic reservoirs (dogs). Lutzomyia longipalpis comprised 96.5% of the total phlebotomine sand flies captured and displayed an expressive minimal infection rate by Leishmania infantum (16.7%). Positive correlations were found between the population densities of L. longipalpis, rainfall and temperature. L. infantum was also detected in the cortelezzii complex and, for the first time, in Lutzomyia lloydi. Leishmania braziliensis, an etiological agent of the American cutaneous leishmaniasis, was also identified in L. longipalpis. Among the 1408 dogs serologically tested by standard enzyme-linked and fluorescence immune assays (ELISA/IFA) 3.6% were positive for VL. L. infantum DNA and Leishmania parasites were identified in 100% and 72.5% of the seropositive dogs, respectively. The co-positivity of other diagnostic tests for VL- Leishmania-nested PCR, imprint and myeloculture-was compared to the standard serology. Both symptomatic or asymptomatic dogs displayed an equal average number of positive diagnostic tests for VL. The districts studied display favorable conditions for the rapid spreading of human infection, in terms of L. longipalpis population density, and presence of L. infantum in both vector and main reservoir.

Wenceslau, A.D. Munhoz, F.L. Silva;Epidemiology of canine leishmaniasis in southern Bahia, Brazil;Leishmaniosis is a zoonosis caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. American cutaneous leishmaniosis (ACL) is mainly caused by the species L. amazonensis and L. braziliensis, and American visceral leishmaniosis (AVL) is caused by L. infantum chagasi. In addition to their proven roles as reservoirs of AVL, dogs are also suspected by researchers to be reservoirs of ACL due to reports of this infection in domestic environments and of infected dogs in endemic areas. The aim of this study was to detect Leishmania sp. infection in dogs from Vila OperÃ¡ria, Buerarema, Bahia, using parasitological tests, indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Furthermore, this study also aimed to identify risk factors associated with illness in dogs in this locality by conducting an epidemiological survey. For this purpose, 292 dogs were clinically evaluated for the presence of skin lesions, and the dogs that showed these changes were submitted to scarification injury to enable preparation of slides for microscopic study of amastigotes. Subsequently, the dogs underwent blood sampling for serological (IFA) and molecular (PCR) tests. Additionally, the owners of the dogs answered an epidemiological questionnaire to facilitate the identification of risk factors for exposure of dogs to pathogens of ACL. Of the 292 dogs studied, 13 (4.5%) had lesions suggestive of ACL, but with a negative parasitological examination and 147 (50.3%) were seropositive according to the IFA. Of the 273 dogs studied using PCR test, 10 (3.66%) were positive for L. braziliensis, and all samples were negative for L. infantum chagasi. Wastelands in the peridomicile and the presence of light in the household were risk factors associated with ACL. The results show that Vila OperÃ¡ria has asymptomatic dogs with ACL and that the detection sensitivity of the IFA was higher than that of PCR for the infected dogs.

Willi, A.M. Spiri, M.L. Meli, F. Grimm, L. Beatrice, B. Riond, T. Bley, R. Jordi, M. Dennler, R. Hofmann-Lehmann;Clinical and molecular investigation of a canine distemper outbreak and vector-borne infections in a group of rescue dogs imported from Hungary to Switzerland;"Background: Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a major pathogen of dogs and wild carnivores worldwide. In Switzerland, distemper in domestic dogs is rarely reported. In recent years, the import of dogs from Eastern Europe to Switzerland has steadily increased. In the present study, we describe a distemper outbreak in 15 rescue dogs that were imported from Hungary to Switzerland by an animal welfare organisation. The data on vaccination and medical history were recorded (14 dogs), and the samples were collected to investigate CDV and vector-borne infections (13 dogs) and canine parvovirus infection (12 dogs). The dogs were monitored for six months. Results: One dog was euthanised directly after import. Thirteen dogs showed clinical signs after arrival, i.e., diarrhoea (57 %), coughing (43 %) and nasal and/or ocular discharge (21 %); radiographic findings that were compatible with bronchopneumonia were present in four dogs. CDV infection was diagnosed in 11 dogs (85 %); 10 dogs (91 %) tested PCR-positive in conjunctival swabs. Vector-borne infections (Babesia spp., Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis) were found in 4 dogs (31 %). Three dogs were hospitalized, and six dogs received ambulatory therapy for up to two months until recovery. None of the dogs developed neurological disease. CDV shedding was detected for a period of up to four months. Because dogs were put under strict quarantine until CDV shedding ceased, CDV did not spread to any other dogs. The CDV isolates showed 99 % sequence identity in the HA gene among each other and belonged to the Arctic-like lineage of CDV. Conclusions: The present study highlights the imminent risks of spreading contagious viral and vector-borne infections through the non-selective import of sick dogs and dogs with incomplete vaccination from Eastern Europe. CDV shedding was detected for several months after the cessation of clinical signs, which emphasised the roles of asymptomatic carriers in CDV epidemiology. A long-term follow-up using sensitive PCR and strict quarantine measures is of upmost importance in preventing the spread of infection. Dog owners and animal welfare organisations should be educated regarding the importance of complete vaccinations and the impact of dog imports on the spread of viral and vector-borne pathogens.

Gao, J.-Y. Wang, S. Zhang, Y.-T. Yang, Y. Wang;Survey of wild and domestic mammals for infection with leishmania infantum following an outbreak of desert zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in Jiashi, People's Republic of China;"In 2008 and 2009, an outbreak of desert-subtype zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis occurred in Jiashi county, Xinjiang, China. So far, no animal reservoir has been identified for this type of visceral leishmaniasis. Therefore, we surveyed the most common mammals (wild and domestic) for Leishmania infections during the outbreak in 2008 and 2009 in order to identify the source of the visceral leishmaniasis in this region. Spleen, liver, bone marrow and blood samples collected from 86 wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus), 61midday jirds (Meriones meridianus) and 27 Yarkand hares (Lepus yarkandensis) were tested for the presence of Leishmania by microscopy, culture and PCR. All of the animals were found to be negative for Leishmania infections; On the other hand, Leishmania DNA was detected in blood samples collected from livestock reared in the outbreak area: 30.36% (17/56) of sheep, 21.57% (11/51) of goats, 17.78% (8/45) of cattle, and 21.62 (8/37) of donkeys were positive for Leishmania DNA by PCR. The amplified kDNA sequences from the livestock samples matched Leishmania DNA sequences isolated from patients with visceral leishmaniasis in the study area. We suggest that these domestic mammals are a possible reservoir host for Leishmania infantum in the outbreak area.

Uzun, M. Karakas;Clinical manifestations and genetic variation of Leishmania infantum and Leishmania tropica in Southern Turkey;L. infantum was isolated from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) skin lesions in patients having no signs and symptoms of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Similarly, L. tropica had previously been isolated from patients with VL in the absence of cutaneous lesions. It was not certain how visceralization occurred. Smears (207) and bone marrow samples (135) were taken from CL and VL-suspected patients, respectively. Microscopic examination, ITS1-PCR, RFLP and DNA sequencing for all samples were analyzed. The microscopic examination of smears was found to be 61.3% (127/207) in CL-suspected cases and bone marrow samples were found to be positive 8.8% (12/135) in VL-suspected cases. L. tropica 48.6% (72/148), L. infantum 35.8% (53/148), L. major 15.6% (23/148) in CL, and L. infantum 56.3% (18/32), L. donovani 31.2% (10/32), L. tropica 12.5% (4/32) in VL were found with PCR-RFLP. In addition, the DNA sequencing revealed a genetic variation in L. infantum (variants 1-3) and L. tropica (variants 1-5). We assume that the increased disease occurrence may have resulted from geographical expansion of disease, changing patterns of international travel, population migrations, non-immune people into endemic regions of infected people into non-endemic regions. In this study, L. infantum (variant 3) only in CL-patients and L. tropica (variant 2) only in VL-patients were identified. We hypothesize that genetic variation might play a role in the causation of CL and VL in southern Turkey and the genetic variants may differ according to the geographical location among Leishmania strains.

Volf;Canine antibodies against salivary recombinant proteins of phlebotomus perniciosus: A longitudinal study in an endemic focus of canine Leishmaniasis;Background Phlebotomine sand flies are vectors of Leishmania parasites. During blood feeding, sand flies deposit into the host skin immunogenic salivary proteins which elicit specific antibody responses. These anti-saliva antibodies enable an estimate of the host exposure to sand flies and, in leishmaniasis endemic areas, also the risk for Leishmania infections. However, the use of whole salivary gland homogenates as antigen has several limitations, and therefore, recombinant salivary proteins have been tested to replace them in antibody detection assays. In this study, we have used for the first time sand fly salivary recombinant proteins in a longitudinal field study on dogs. Methodology/Principal Findings Sera from dogs naturally exposed to P. perniciosus bites over two consecutive transmission seasons in a site endemic for canine leishmaniasis (CanL) were tested at different time points by ELISA for the antibodies recognizing whole saliva, single salivary 43 kDa yellowrelated recombinant protein (rSP03B), and a combination of two salivary recombinant proteins, 43 kDa yellow-related protein and 35.5 kDa apyrase (rSP01). Dogs were also tested for Leishmania infantum positivity by serology, culture, and PCR and the infection status was evaluated prospectively. We found a significant association between active CanL infection and the amount of anti-P. perniciosus saliva antibodies. Importantly, we detected a high correlation between IgG antibodies recognizing rSP03B protein and the whole salivary antigen. The kinetics of antibody response showed for both a whole saliva and rSP03B a similar pattern that was clearly related to the seasonal abundance of P. perniciosus. Conclusions These results suggest that P. perniciosus rSP03B protein is a valid alternative to whole saliva and could be used in large-scale serological studies. This novel method could be a practical and economically-sound tool to detect the host exposure to sand fly bites in CanL endemic areas.

Alimohammadian, A. Khamesipour, B. Akhoundi, Z. Zarei;Canine visceral leishmaniasis: seroprevalence survey of asymptomatic dogs in an endemic area of northwestern Iran;Canine visceral leishmaniasis is a major public health problem that is endemic in tropical and sub tropical countries and is fatal in humans and dogs. In addition to symptomatic dogs, asymptomatic ones seem as source of Leishmania infantum infection. Thus surveillance and control programs of reservoir hosts are essential. This study aimed to evaluate the sero-prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis in asymptomatic domestic dogs from in an endemic area of north west, Iran. A cross sectional study was carried out in Meshkin-Shahr district during 2011â€“2012. Blood samples collected from 508 asymptomatic domestic dogs were tested by direct agglutination test. In this study 508 dogs (397 males and 111 females, mean age, 3.24Â years) from western and eastern parts of the Meshkin-Shahr were examined. A total of 508 dogs examined 119 dogs (23.4Â %) had antibodies (titers ofÂ â‰¥1:320) against L. infantum. Statistically significance was occurred between male (25.4Â %) and female (16.2) sero-prevalence (PÂ =Â 0.042). No statistically significance was observed between age groups (PÂ =Â 0.22). Compared with previous studies it seems to increase sero-prevalence of visceral leishmaniasis in dogs in the studied areas caused by ecological changes. High proportion of asymptomatic but seropositive dogs emphasizes the importance of dogs without clinical signs in the epidemiology of zoonotic leishmaniasis. Thus, the necessity of using serological tests in asymptomatic dogs is recommended for disease control strategy.

Berriatua;Spatial distribution of human asymptomatic Leishmania infantum infection in southeast Spain: A study of environmental, demographic and social risk factors;Recent PCR studies indicate that asymptomatic L. infantum infection is common in people in southern Europe. Understanding its spatial distribution is a requisite to evaluate the public health implications and to design disease control schemes. We investigated infection in blood samples from 657 donors in southeast Spain using PCR and antibody ELISA. They came from 19 blood centers and were interviewed about their residence, occupation, dog ownership and Leishmaniosis awareness. The percentage of PCR and ELISA positives were 8% (49/618) and 2% (13/657). Donor's residences were spatially clustered around blood donning centers and PCR prevalence was 18% in rural municipalities with 20-1330 inhabitants, 12% in those with 1467-5088 inhabitants and 3% in larger communities, and was associated with dog ownership (p<. 0.05). Further analysis of data from rural donors indicated that PCR status was strongly related to the climate, altitude and soil type in the donor's residence area and not to other demographic or sociologic variables. Mixed logistic regression analysis predicted PCR prevalence to be greatest in the 200-300. m altitude range with a mean spring-summer (time of highest vector activity) temperature of 18.4-19.0. Â°C. A temperature and altitude risk map was generated that will provide the basis for elaborating evidence-based vector surveillance studies.

Åžimsek, N. Dumanli;A molecular and parasitological survey of Hepatozoon canis in domestic dogs in Turkey;"In this study, asymptomatic dogs in nine provinces of Turkey were surveyed to investigate the prevalence and intensity of Hepatozoon canis infection. DNA obtained from blood samples collected from 694 domestic dogs (243 stray, 288 shelter, and 163 pets) of both genders and varying ages were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, 285 thin blood smears prepared from these blood samples were also evaluated for microscopic examination. Direct microscopy revealed Hepatozoon gamonts in the peripheral blood of three of 285 (1.0%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.21-3.04) tested. Using PCR, 155 of the 694 (22.3%; 95% CI: 19.28-25.61) were found to be positive for the presence of H. canis DNA. The prevalence of infection was higher in adult dogs (26.2%; 95% CI: 22.1-30.7) than young animals (16.4%; 95% CI: 12.2-21.3). Although the prevalence determined by PCR was higher in male dogs (24.5%; 95% CI: 19.6-29.9) than in female dogs (20.8%; 95% CI: 16.9-25.1), gender differences were not significant. Pet dogs had a lower prevalence of infection (10.4%; 95% CI: 6.2-16.2) compared to stray (26.3%; 95% CI: 20.9-32.3) and shelter dogs (25.7%; 95% CI: 20.7-31.1), but no significant association between stray and shelter dogs was found for the presence of the parasite. Partial sequences of the 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene shared 99-100% similarity with the corresponding H. canis isolates. This epidemiological survey revealed a high prevalence of H. canis in dogs from several provinces in Turkey, and it suggests that the age and origin are associated with the parasite.

Trotta;Acute febrile illness is associated with Rickettsia spp infection in dogs;"Background: Rickettsia conorii is transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks and causes Mediterranean Spotted Fever (MSF) in humans. Although dogs are considered the natural host of the vector, the clinical and epidemiological significance of R. conorii infection in dogs remains unclear. The aim of this prospective study was to investigate whether Rickettsia infection causes febrile illness in dogs living in areas endemic for human MSF. Methods: Dogs from southern Italy with acute fever (nâˆˆ=âˆˆ99) were compared with case-control dogs with normal body temperatures (nâˆˆ=âˆˆ72). Serology and real-time PCR were performed for Rickettsia spp., Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum/A. platys and Leishmania infantum. Conventional PCR was performed for Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp. Acute and convalescent antibodies to R. conorii, E. canis and A. phagocytophilum were determined. Results: The seroprevalence rates at first visit for R. conorii, E. canis, A. phagocytophilum and L. infantum were 44.8%, 48.5%, 37.8% and 17.6%, respectively. The seroconversion rates for R. conorii, E. canis and A. phagocytophilum were 20.7%, 14.3% and 8.8%, respectively. The molecular positive rates at first visit for Rickettsia spp., E. canis, A. phagocytophilum, A. platys, L. infantum, Babesia spp. and Hepatozoon spp. were 1.8%, 4.1%, 0%, 2.3%, 11.1%, 2.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Positive PCR for E. canis (7%), Rickettsia spp. (3%), Babesia spp. (4.0%) and Hepatozoon spp. (1.0%) were found only in febrile dogs. The DNA sequences obtained from Rickettsia and Babesia PCRs positive samples were 100% identical to the R. conorii and Babesia vogeli sequences in GenBankÂ®, respectively. Febrile illness was statistically associated with acute and convalescent positive R. conorii antibodies, seroconversion to R. conorii, E. canis positive PCR, and positivity to any tick pathogen PCRs. Fourteen febrile dogs (31.8%) were diagnosed with Rickettsia spp. infection based on seroconversion and/or PCR while only six afebrile dogs (12.5%) seroconverted (Pâˆˆ=âˆˆ0.0248). The most common clinical findings of dogs with Rickettsia infection diagnosed by seroconversion and/or PCR were fever, myalgia, lameness, elevation of C-reactive protein, thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia. Conclusions: This study demonstrates acute febrile illness associated with Rickettsia infection in dogs living in endemic areas of human MSF based on seroconversion alone or in combination with PCR.

In order to study the presence of Leishmania DNA in phlebotomine sand flies, six entomological collections were carried out from July 2008 through July 2009, using 40 light traps placed in peridomicile areas of 20 randomly selected houses. From October 2011 through August 2012, another six collections were carried out with 20 light traps distributed among four trails (five traps per trail) selected for a previous study of wild and synanthropic hosts of Leishmania. A total of 4,760 phlebotomine specimens were collected belonging to ten genera and twenty-three species. Single female specimens or pools with up to ten specimens of the same locality, species and date, for Leishmania detection by molecular methods. Species identification of parasites was performed with ITS1 PCR-RFLP using HaeIII enzyme and genetic sequencing for SSU rRNA target. The presence of Leishmania DNA was detected in eleven samples from peridomicile areas: Lu. longipalpis (two), Nyssomyia intermedia (four), Lu. renei (two), Lu. ischnacantha, Micropygomyia goiana and Evandromyia lenti (one pool of each specie). The presence of Leishmania DNA was detected in twelve samples from among the trails: Martinsmyia minasensis (six), Ny. intermedia (three), Mi. peresi (two) and Ev. lenti (one). The presence of Leishmania infantum DNA in Lu. longipalpis and Leishmania braziliensis DNA in Ny. intermediasupport the epidemiological importance of these species of sand flies in the cycle of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. The results also found other species associated with Leishmania DNA, such as Mt. minasensis and Ev. lenti, which may participate in a wild and/or synanthropic cycle of Leishmania transmission in the studied area.

Campino;Prevalence of Dirofilaria immitis antigen and antibodies to Leishmania infantum in cats from southern Portugal;Vector-borne diseases (VBD) are caused by a range of pathogens transmitted by arthropods and have emerged in recent years, showing a wider geographic distribution and increased global prevalence. In addition to their veterinary medical importance, cats play a central role in the transmission cycles of some VBD agents by acting as reservoirs, amplifying hosts or sentinels. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of Dirofilaria immitis antigen and of antibodies to Leishmania infantum in a sample of 271 cats from southern Portugal. Thirteen (4.8%) cats were positive to D. immitis, while antibodies to L. infantum were detected in 10 (3.7%) animals. The prevalence of D. immitis and L. infantum in the feline population from southern Portugal should alert for the need to implement control measures to protect animals and people from these zoonotic parasites. Furthermore, both parasitoses must be included in the differential diagnosis in feline clinical practice.

By using a genus-specific 18S rRNA PCR, Hepatozoon and Theileria spp. were detected in 8% and 18%, respectively, of ticks ( n = 79) removed from mammals. Of the ticks removed from snakes ( n = 24), 96% were infected with Hepatozoon spp., but none were infected with Theileria. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Hepatozoon spp. detected from Dermacentor astrosignatus and Dermacentor auratus ticks from Wild boar ( Sus scrofa) formed a phylogenetic group with many isolates of Hepatozoon felis that were distantly related to a species group containing Hepatozoon canis and Hepatozoon americanum. In contrast, a phylogenetic analysis of the Hepatozoon sequences of snake ticks revealed that Hepatozoon spp. from Amblyomma varanense from King cobra ( Ophiophagus hannah) and Amblyomma helvolum ticks from Indochinese rat snake ( Ptyas korros), and Asiatic water snake ( Xenochrophis piscator) are grouped with Hepatozoon spp. recently isolated from Monocellate cobras, Reticulated pythons and Burmese pythons, all of Thai origin, and with Hepatozoon sp. 774c that has been detected from a tick species obtained from Argus monitors in Australia. A phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that Theileria spp. from Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, Haemaphysalis obesa, and Haemaphysalis lagrangei ticks from Sambar deer ( Cervus unicolor) cluster with the Theileria cervi isolates WU11 and 239, and Theileria sp.

We report for the first time a Hepatozoon species that shares genetic similarity with Hepatozoon felis found in Dermacentor astrosignatus and Dermacentor auratus ticks collected from Wild boars in Thailand. In addition, we found the presence of a Theileria cervi-like sp. which suggests the potential role of Haemaphysalis lagrangei as a Theileria vector in Thailand.

Although H. canis generally causes a chronic infection with relatively mild clinical alterations compared to H. americanum, infection by H. canis can be life-threatening. The disease is widespread in USA, Africa, Europe, South America, and Asia. To determine the frequency of infection with Hepatozoon spp. in stray dogs from Central Anatolia Region of Turkey, a total of 221 blood samples collected over a three-year period were evaluated by using genus specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) designed to amplify a fragment of 666. bp located in 18 S rRNA gene of Hepatozoon spp. Eight (3.61%) blood samples were positive for Hepatozoon spp. For the classification of species, all positive PCR products were purified with a PCR purification kit and sequenced. Sequencing results of eight representative amplicons indicated that 6 were 98-99% identical to the sequence of H. canis and the other 2 sequences were 95-97% identical to the sequence of Hepatozoon spp. So it was named Hepatozoon sp. MF. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the sequences of the tick-borne agents identified previously and in this study using the neighbor-joining method. The nucleotide sequences were compared to the H. canis sequences reported in Turkey using the nucleotide Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) program. The results of this study are significant in terms of the presence of a novel canine Hepatozoon genotype.

Campino;Molecular detection of Leishmania DNA and identification of blood meals in wild caught phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) from southern Portugal;"Background: Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum which is transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera, Psychodidae) is endemic in the Mediterranean basin. The main objectives of this study were to (i) detect Leishmania DNA and (ii) identify blood meal sources in wild caught female sand flies in the zoonotic leishmaniasis region of Algarve, Portugal/Southwestern Europe. Methods: Phlebotomine sand flies were collected using CDC miniature light traps and sticky papers. Sand flies were identified morphologically and tested for Leishmania sp. by PCR using ITS-1 as the target sequence. The source of blood meal of the engorged females was determined using the cyt-b sequence. Results: Out of the 4,971 (2,584 males and 2,387 females) collected sand flies, Leishmania DNA was detected by PCR in three females (0.13%), specifically in two specimens identified on the basis of morphological features as Sergentomyia minuta and one as Phlebotomus perniciosus. Haematic preferences, as defined by the analysis of cyt-b DNA amplified from the blood-meals detected in the engorged female specimens, showed that P. perniciosus fed on a wide range of domestic animals while human and lizard DNA was detected in engorged S. minuta. Conclusions: The anthropophilic behavior of S. minuta together with the detection of Leishmania DNA highlights the need to determine the role played by this species in the transmission of Leishmania parasites to humans. In addition, on-going surveillance on Leishmania vectors is crucial as the increased migration and travelling flow elevate the risk of introduction and spread of infections by Leishmania species which are non-endemic.

Gurgel-GonÃ§alves;Expanding the knowledge about Leishmania species in wild mammals and dogs in the Brazilian savannah;"Background: Wild, synanthropic and domestic mammals act as hosts and/or reservoirs of several Leishmania spp. Studies on possible reservoirs of Leishmania in different areas are fundamental to understand host-parasite interactions and develop strategies for the surveillance and control of leishmaniasis. In the present study, we evaluated the Leishmania spp. occurrence in mammals in two conservation units and their surroundings in BrasÃ­lia, Federal District (FD), Brazil. Methods: Small mammals were captured in BrasÃ­lia National Park (BNP) and Contagem Biological Reserve (CBR) and dogs were sampled in residential areas in their vicinity. Skin and blood samples were evaluated by PCR using different molecular markers (D7 24SÎ± rRNA and rDNA ITS1). Leishmania species were identified by sequencing of PCR products. Dog blood samples were subjected to the rapid immunochromatographic test (DPP) for detection of anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies. Results: 179 wild mammals were studied and 20.1% had Leishmania DNA successfully detected in at least one sample. Six mammal species were considered infected: Clyomys laticeps, Necromys lasiurus, Nectomys rattus, Rhipidomys macrurus, Didelphis albiventris and Gracilinanus agilis. No significant difference, comparing the proportion of individuals with Leishmania spp., was observed between the sampled areas and wild mammal species. Most of the positive samples were collected from the rodent N. lasiurus, infected by L. amazonensis or L. braziliensis. Moreover, infections by Trypanosoma spp. were detected in N. lasiurus and G. agilis. All 19 dog samples were positive by DPP; however, only three (15.8%) were confirmed by PCR assays. DNA sequences of ITS1 dog amplicons showed 100% identity with L. infantum sequence. Conclusions: The results suggest the participation of six species of wild mammals in the enzootic transmission of Leishmania spp. in FD. This is the first report of L. amazonensis in N. lasiurus.

Gontijo;Mixed infection of Leishmania infantum and Leishmania braziliensis in rodents from endemic urban area of the New World;Background: In Brazil Leishmania braziliensis and L. infantum are the principal species responsible for cutaneous and visceral leishmaniases, respectively. Domestic dogs are the main reservoirs of visceral leishmaniasis, while rodents and marsupials are the main reservoirs for cutaneous leishmaniasis. It has also been suggested that dogs could play a role in transmission of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The identification of the species of Leishmania, the reservoirs, and the vectors involved in each particular transmission cycle is critical for the establishment of control activities. Belo Horizonte has emerged as an endemic region for leishmaniases, however, epidemiological studies assessing the contribution of wild reservoirs to transmission are scarce in the area. The aim of this study was to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in possible reservoirs of an urbanized area. Results: A high rate of infection was found in small mammals (64.9%) and dogs (DG1 30.4% and DG2 48.6%). The presence of L. infantum and L. braziliensis was detected in small mammals and dogs, and mixed infections by both species were detected in rodents which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first description of this phenomenon in an urban area. Additionally, L. amazonensis was detected in the canine samples. Conclusion: The possible role of these animals as a source of infection of the vector of each species of Leishmania identified should not be overlooked and should be taken into account in future control activities. The results of mixed infection by L. braziliensis and L. infantum in cosmopolitan rodents as M. musculus and R. rattus, may have important implications in the context of the control of leishmaniasis in urban areas, especially when considering that these rodents live in close relationship with human dwellings, especially those in more precarious conditions.

Berkvens;Estimation of canine leishmania infection prevalence in six cities of the algerian littoral zone using a bayesian approach;A large-scale study on canine Leishmania infection (CanL) was conducted in six localities along a west-east transect in the Algerian littoral zone (Tlemcen, Mostaganem, Tipaza, Boumerdes, Bejaia, Jijel) and covering two sampling periods. In total 2,184 dogs were tested with an indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and a direct agglutination test (DAT). Combined multiple-testing and several statistical methods were compared to estimate the CanL true prevalence and tests characteristics (sensitivity and specificity). The Bayesian full model showed the best fit and yielded prevalence estimates between 11% (Mostaganem, first period) and 38% (Bejaia, second period). Sensitivity of IFAT varied (in function of locality) between 86% and 88% while its specificity varied between 65% and 87%. DAT was less sensitive than IFAT but showed a higher specificity (between 80% and 95% in function of locality or/and season). A general increasing trend of the CanL prevalence was noted from west to east. A concordance between the present results and the incidence of human cases of visceral leishmaniasis was observed, where also a maximum was recorded for Bejaia. The results of the present study highlight the dangers when using IFAT as a gold standard.

Methods: Molecular testing was executed on DNA which was extracted from blood specimens collected from 117 asymptomatic dogs to detect Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia canis (B. canis), Bartonella spp., Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii), Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis, and Leishmania infantum. Results: A total of 48 dogs (41.0%) were infested by Ixodes ricinus and Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks. Tick-borne infections were observed in 64 (54.7%) animals. More in detail, 38 dogs (32.5%) screened positive for Hepatozoon canis, 24 (20.5%) for Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii, 20 (17.1%) for Leishmania infantum, 6 (5.1%) for C. burnetii, 5 (4.3%) for B. canis (3 B. canis vogeli and 2 B. canis canis), 3 (2.5%) for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and 2 (1.7%) for Ehrlichia canis. Mixed infection by 2 agents occurred in 17 (14.5%) subjects, by 3 agents in 7 (6.0%) dogs, and by 4 agents in 1 (0.9%) animal. Conclusions: The results demonstrated that several vector-borne pathogens were circulating in this region and dogs infected by these agents were usually asymptomatic. A relevant finding was the presence of DNA of C. burnetii, a severe zoonotic agent, in the 5.1% of tested dogs, which can be source of infection for their owners not only through tick bites, but also directly with urine, feces and birth products.

Campino;Bacterial and protozoal agents of canine vector-borne diseases in the blood of domestic and stray dogs from southern Portugal;"Background: The so-called canine vector-borne diseases (CVBD) are caused by a wide range of pathogens transmitted by arthropods. In addition to their veterinary importance, many of these canine vector-borne pathogens can also affect the human population due to their zoonotic potential, a situation that requires a One Health approach. As the prevalence of vector-borne pathogens in cats from southern Portugal has been recently evaluated, the aim of the present study was to assess if the same agents were present in dogs living in the same area, and to assess positivity-associated risk factors. Methods: One thousand and ten dogs (521 domestic and 489 stray) from veterinary medical centres and animal shelters in southern Portugal were enrolled. Anaplasma spp./Ehrlichia spp., Bartonella spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Babesia spp., Hepatozoon spp. and Leishmania infantum infections were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in blood samples. Results: Sixty-eight (6.7%) dogs were PCR-positive to at least one of the tested CVBD agent species, genera or complex, including one dog found positive to two different genera. Nineteen (1.9%) dogs were positive to Anaplasma spp./Ehrlichia spp., eight (0.8%) to B. burgdorferi s.l., 31 (3.1%) to Hepatozoon spp. and 11 (1.1%) to L. infantum. Anaplasma platys, Ehrlichia canis, B. burgdorferis.l. and Hepatozoon canis were identified by DNA sequencing, including one animal confirmed with both A. platys and H. canis. Furthermore, Wolbachia spp. was amplified in blood from four dogs. None of the tested dogs was positive by PCR for Bartonella spp. or Babesia spp. Conclusions: The molecular identification of CVBD agents in southern Portugal, some of them with zoonotic concern, reinforces the importance to alert the veterinary community, owners and public health authorities to prevent the risk of transmission of vector-borne pathogens among dogs and to other vertebrate hosts including humans. The prevalence of the selected pathogens was lower than that previously found in cats from the same region, probably because veterinarians and owners are more aware of them in the canine population and control measures are used more often.

Bornay-Llinares;Identification of Leishmania infantum in Puerto IguazÃš, Misiones, Argentina;The emergence of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (ZVL) in Latin America is a growing public health problem. The urbanization of ZVL has been observed in different countries around the world, and there are a growing number of reports drawing attention to the emergence of this infection in new locations, as well as its increase in previously established areas of endemicity. In the city of Posadas, Misiones province, Northeastern Argentina, the transmission of ZVL associated with canines and Lutzomyia longipalpis was first reported in 2006. In the city of Puerto IguazÃº, also in Misiones province, the first human case of ZVL was reported in February 2014. From 209 surveyed dogs, 15 (7.17%) were identified as positive by serological and/or parasitological methods. Amplification was observed in 14 samples and in all cases the species implicated was Leishmania infantum. To the authorsâ€™ knowledge, this is the first molecular characterization of L. infantum from dogs in this area. Â© 2015, Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo.

This study observed the mainly tick borne pathogens described for dogs in Thailand, Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis and Babesia canis vogeli. From May to July 2014, blood samples were collected from 79 stray dogs from 7 districts of Mahasarakham province to molecular surveyed for 16s rRNA gene of E. canis and 18s rRNA gene of H. canis and B. canis vogeli. Twenty eight (35.44%) of stray dogs showed the infection with tick borne pathogens. The prevalence of E. canis infection was the highest with 21.5% (17/79). DNA of H. canis and B. canis vogeli were detected at the prevalence of 10.1% (8/79) and 6.3% (5/79), respectively. Co-infection between E. canis and B. canis vogeli were identified in 2 (2.5%) dogs. The results indicated that a wide range of tick borne pathogens are circulation in the canine population in Mahasarakham province.

Hashiguchi, M.A. BasombÅ•o;Visceral leishmaniasis caused by leishmania infantum in salta, Argentina: Possible reservoirs and vectors;Cases of human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) were not recorded until recently in the Chaco region of northwestern Argentina. Dogs were surveyed at the sites of infection of two HVL index cases in the Chaco region of Salta province. Canine cases (CanL) were diagnosed by two parasitological methods, two molecular methods targeting mini-and maxicircle DNA, and immunochromatographic dipstick. Among 77 dogs studied, 10 (13%) were found infected with Leishmania spp. In seven dogs and two humans, the infecting species was typed as Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum. The same genotype was detected in the human and two of the CanL. Although several diagnostic methods displayed weak or moderate agreement, the concordance values for serology versus maxicircle PCR were very good (Kappa index = 0.84). Sandflies captured in the area were identified as Lutzomyia migonei and Lu. cortelezzii/Lu. sallesi (cortelezzii complex). The focal appearance of leishmaniasis in dogs and humans in a sylvatic region and its relatively low prevalence of infection suggests that L. (L.) infantum transmission to dogs and humans may, in this region, stem from sylvatic reservoirs.

Ramos, J.M. CristÃ³vÃ£o, L. Cardoso, L. Campino;Serological investigation of Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis and Angiostrongylus vasorum in dogs from southern Portugal;"Background: Leishmaniosis, dirofilariosis and angiostrongylosis are parasitic diseases of established importance in dogs worldwide. The aim of the present report was to determine all together levels of infection with or exposure to Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis and Angiostrongylus vasorum in dogs from the Algarve region, in southern Portugal. Findings: Serum samples were obtained from a total of 170 apparently healthy dogs. Antibodies to L. infantum were detected by the direct agglutination test; and antigens of D. immitis and of A. vasorum by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and an immunochromatography test, respectively. Antibodies to L. infantum were found in 18.2% (31/170) of dogs, while D. immitis antigen was detected in 9.4% (16/170). None of 120 dogs tested out of the 170 under investigation had evidence of infection with A. vasorum. D. immitis infection was more prevalent in dogs aged 84-204 months than in those younger than 12 months. Three dogs were positive to both L. infantum and D. immitis. Conclusions: Dogs living in southern Portugal are at risk of leishmaniosis and dirofilariosis. This scenario should make the veterinary community, local dog owners and also tourists from non-endemic countries coming on vacation with their pets aware of the need of effective prophylactic measures, in order to protect animals and public health.

Cancrini;Canine Babesioses in Noninvestigated Areas of Serbia;During the years 2012-2014, a total of 158 outdoor dogs from PanÄevo and Crossed D signurcrossed d signevo (northern Serbia) and NiÅ¡ and Prokuplje (southern Serbia) were submitted to molecular analyses (PCR and sequencing) for canine babesioses. An overall prevalence of 21.5% was found, due to the species Babesia sp. 'spanish dog' (10.1%), B. gibsoni (5.7%), B. canis vogeli (1.9%), B. caballi (1.9%), and B. microti (1.9%). In addition, sequence analysis showed the presence of Hepatozoon canis in a dog from NiÅ¡. No significant difference between infected and noninfected dogs was found by age, sex, and place of residence, whereas there was difference regarding the presence of ticks (p<0.005) and application of preventive measures such as applying of antitick drugs/devices. Moreover, a significant difference was established by area: Dogs from Prokuplje showed infection rates (59.1%) higher than dogs from PanÄevo (11.9%), NiÅ¡ (4.5), and Crossed D signurcrossed d signevo (where infected dogs were not found), and a different geographical distribution of the species was found. The presence of so many Babesia species and the first identification of H. canis will allow investigations on the pathogenic role played by each one and suggests entomological studies on the tick species that are more suitable vectors for each of them. Finally, the presence of so many infected dogs offers the opportunity of evaluating the hypothesis of a possible zoonotic role of babesial species affecting dogs.

GonÃ§alves Dias;Description of six autochthonous cases of canine visceral leishmaniasis diagnosed in pedregulho (SÃ£o paulo, brazil);Visceral leishmaniasis is an infectious disease of chronic, emerging and zoonotic nature that presents various degrees of severity. In Brazil, this illness is caused by Leishmania infantum (Leishmania chagasi), which is transmitted by the bite of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, and dogs are its main reservoir. Given the increasing spread of this disease across Brazil, the aim of this study was to report on six cases of canine visceral leishmaniasis, diagnosed in June 2013, in the city of Pedregulho, State of SÃ£o Paulo, considered to be a non-endemic area and free of phlebotomine sand flies. The diagnosis was based on clinical signs of the patients and additional tests (serological and parasitological). It was concluded that the diagnosis of leishmaniasis is complex because the clinical signs are similar to other systemic diseases, thus justifying the importance of parasitological test of bone marrow, considered â€œgold standardâ€, in the confirmation of the disease. In addition, the area was not, until now, considered risk place, despite notification. Â© 2015 Braz. J. Vet. Parasitol., Jaboticabal.

Robertson, P.J. Irwin;Canine vector-borne infections in Mauritius;"Background: Canine vector-borne diseases have a worldwide distribution, but to the best of our knowledge, no research has been carried out to evaluate their presence on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. An investigation into canine vector-borne infections was conducted in dogs (n = 78) resident at an animal shelter in Port Louis, Mauritius using a combination of traditional microscopy and serological methods. Methods: Ticks were manually collected from the stray dog population for identification as well as for quantifying tick burdens. Blood was also collected from each dog via either the jugular vein or the cephalic vein, and was stored in EDTA tubes. The stored blood was then used to measure PCV values, make blood smears for the identification of parasites, and used for serological testing of vector-borne disease. Results: A total of 178 ticks were collected from 52 dogs and identified as Rhipicephalus sanguineus (175/178) or Amblyomma variegatum (3/178). Twenty-six (33%; 95% CI 23, 45) dogs were seropositive for Ehrlichia spp., and 12 (15%; 95% CI 8, 25) for Anaplasma spp., Dirofilaria antigen was detected in 14 (18%; 95% CI 10, 28), and nine (12%; 95% CI 5, 21) dogs had Hepatozoon canis gamonts observed in blood films during microscopic examination. Eleven (14%; 95% CI 7, 24) dogs were co-infected with two pathogens. Borrelia burgdorferi antibodies were not detected in any dogs. Conclusions: Infection with these pathogens had no significant effect on the packed cell volume (PCV), but high tick burdens were significantly associated with the presence of a tick-borne pathogen. This is the first study of its kind on the dog population in Mauritius and demonstrates the presence of previously undocumented canine vector-borne infections on the island. The relatively high proportion of infected dogs within the study should alert clinicians to the presence of canine vector-borne diseases on the island of Mauritius.

Margonari;An Integrated Approach Using Spatial Analysis to Study the Risk Factors for Leishmaniasis in Area of Recent Transmission;Some epidemiological aspects of leishmaniasis in the municipality of Formiga, Brazil, an important touristic site, were evaluated. Those included phlebotomine sand fly vectors, canine infection, and geoprocessing analysis for determining critical transmission areas. Sand flies (224 insects) belonging to ten different species were captured. The most captured species included Lutzomyia longipalpis (35.3%), Lutzomyia cortelezzii (33.5%), and Lutzomyia whitmani (18.3%). A significant correlation between sand fly densities and climatic conditions was detected. Serological diagnosis (DPP and ELISA) was performed in 570 dogs indicating a prevalence of 5.8%. After sequencing the main species circulating in the area were Leishmania infantum and Leishmania braziliensis. Spatial analysis demonstrated that vegetation and hydrography may be related to sand fly distribution and infected dogs. The municipality of Formiga has proven leishmaniasis vectors and infected dogs indicating the circulation of the parasite in the city. Correlation of those data with environmental and human cases has identified the critical areas for control interventions (south, northeast, and northwest). In conclusion, there is current transmission of visceral and canine human cases and the city is on the risk for the appearance of cutaneous cases.

Kakoee, F. Najafi;Seroepidemiological survey of human visceral leishmaniasis in Ilam province, west of Iran in 2013;Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) as one of the most important human parasitic disease is endemic in some parts of Iran. Several cases of VL have been reported recently in the Ilam Province. The current study aimed to assess the present status of human VL in the region. Methods: A random cluster sampling method was used to collect 456 serums samples from the children up to 12 years of age and 10% of adults living in urban and rural areas of the province. All the collected serum samples were tested by direct agglutination test (DAT) to detect anti- Leishmania infantum antibodies. Results: Of the examined 456 serum samples with direct agglutination test (DAT), only 21 (0.43%) sera showed anti- Leishmania antibodies at titers 1:400 and higher. Distribution of anti- Leishmania antibodies titers were: 1:400(n=4), 1:800(n=11), 1:1600(n=3), 1:3200(n=1), and 1:6400(n=1). Individuals with titers =1:3200 showed clinical signs and symptoms such as fever and splenomegaly. The highest and lowest seropositivity were observed in the age groups of 5â€“9 and >15 years old, respectively. There were no significant difference between the rate of seropositivity in males and females. Conclusion: VL with a low prevalence circulates in some parts of Ilam province, particularly in the southern parts. Complementary studies should be needed to find animal reservoir hosts and vectors. Furthermore, health systems and physicians should pay particular attention to the disease. Â© 2015, Iran J Parasitol.

Methods: In this study, 65 cats from different parts of Ahar Province were trapped. The cats were anesthetized with chloroform and blood samples were taken from jugular vein and tested by direct agglutination test. Spleen and liver smear samples were prepared in order to microscopically examine these organs, and also cultured in Novy-MacNeal-Nicolle and Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1 640 media. Finally, spleen tissue DNA was extracted to perform polymerase chain reaction analysis. Results: In direct agglutination test, 4 (6%) cats had a positive titer, while 14 (22%) cats had a titer of 1:80 which was suspected for an infection and 47 (72%) cats were negative. Culture results were negative and in polymerase chain reaction no amplification was observed. Conclusions: We found no case of feline visceral leishmaniasis. It needs more extensive studies by using a larger number of cats to firmly establish leishmaniasis in this area.

Solid and decomposing waste is an ideal breeding ground for a number of rodents, insects, and other vermin that pose a health risk through the spread of infectious diseases. The main objective of this study was to survey disease vectors and rodents for the presence of Leishmania sp. from waste sites along the Istrian Peninsula in Slovenia and Croatia. During the survey five sandfly (Phlebotomus neglectus, P. perniciosus, P. papatasi, P. mascitii, Sergentomyia minuta) and five rodent species were collected (Rattus rattus, Mus musculus, Apodemus agrarius, A. flavicollis and A. sylvaticus). Sandfl ies and rodents were screened using a molecular probe to amplify an approximately 120 bp fragment of the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircle for the detection of Leishmania sp. parasites. Leishmania infantum DNA was detected in the spleen of one juvenile black rat (R. rattus). Despite few published records on Leshmania sp. infection in black rats, the addition of our record highlights the importance of further investigation into the frequency and distribution of such occurrences so that we may better classify the role of rodents as potential reservoirs of leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean basin.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;10.1515/acve-2015-0029;;;;357;;;;;;;3;Acta Veterinaria;Leishmania,Phlebotomine sandflies,Rodents;;Cited By :2,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;348;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943388244&doi=10.1515%2facve-2015-0029&partnerID=40&md5=a247b536bf14abcf5e2745580b0ddf25;65;2015;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

A total of 303 EDTA blood samples were collected from domestic dogs in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand, in May 2013. Microscopic observation of Giemsa-stained smears and molecular diagnosis using conventional PCR were performed. Infected dogs were treated with imidocarb dipropionate, a combination of imidocarb dipropionate and doxycycline, or doxycycline alone. Seventy-one (23.4%) out of 303 dogs were positive for DNA of tick-borne pathogens. Of the 303 animals, 13.2% and 1.3% were positive for a single infection with Babesia spp or Ehrlichia canis, respec- tively using microscopy; whereas 19.5% and 3.0% were positive using the PCR technique. Co-infection with Babesia spp and E. canis was observed in 0.7%, and coinfection with Hepatozoon canis and E. canis in 0.3%. Infected dogs were treated with the assigned drugs, and elimination of the pathogens was demonstrated by microscopy and PCR. The results indicated that while both microscopic and PCR diagnostic techniques were useful for tick-borne pathogen detection, PCR was more effective. Imidocarb dipropionate and doxycycline were found to be effective for treatment of babesiosis and ehrlichiosis, respectively.

Marcelino, A.A. Ribeiro, M. Passamani, G.R. DemÃ©trio, A.G. Chiarello;Factors associated with the seroprevalence of leishmaniasis in dogs living around Atlantic Forest fragments;Canine visceral leishmaniasis is an important zoonosis in Brazil. However, infection patterns are unknown in some scenarios such as rural settlements around Atlantic Forest fragments. Additionally, controversy remains over risk factors, and most identified patterns of infection in dogs have been found in urban areas. We conducted a cross-sectional epidemiological survey to assess the prevalence of leishmaniasis in dogs through three different serological tests, and interviews with owners to assess features of dogs and households around five Atlantic Forest remnants in southeastern Brazil. We used Generalized Linear Mixed Models and Chi-square tests to detect associations between prevalence and variables that might influence Leishmania infection, and a nearest neighbor dispersion analysis to assess clustering in the spatial distribution of seropositive dogs. Our findings showed an average prevalence of 20% (ranging from 10 to 32%) in dogs. Nearly 40% (ranging from 22 to 55%) of households had at least one seropositive dog. Some individual traits of dogs (height, sterilization, long fur, age class) were found to positively influence the prevalence, while some had negative influence (weight, body score, presence of ectoparasites). Environmental and management features (number of cats in the households, dogs with free-ranging behavior) also entered models as negative associations with seropositivity. Strong and consistent negative (protective) influences of the presence of chickens and pigs in dog seropositivity were detected. Spatial clustering of cases was detected in only one of the five study sites. The results showed that different risk factors than those found in urban areas may drive the prevalence of canine leishmaniasis in farm/forest interfaces, and that humans and wildlife risk infection in these areas. Domestic dog population limitation by gonadectomy, legal restriction of dog numbers per household and owner education are of the greatest importance for the control of visceral leishmaniasis in rural zones near forest fragments.

Barral, M. Barral-Netto, C.I. de Oliveira;Serological survey of Leishmania infection in blood donors in Salvador, northeastern Brazil;"Background: Visceral Leishmaniasis is endemic to Brazil, where it is caused by Leishmania infantum (syn. Leishmania chagasi). Following parasite inoculation, individuals may experience asymptomatic infection, raising the possibility of parasite transmission through the transfusion of contaminated blood products. In the present work, we evaluated the prevalence of asymptomatic Leishmania infection among blood donors in Salvador, northeastern Brazil.Methods: Peripheral blood was collected from 700 blood donors attending the Blood Bank of Bahia (HEMOBA/SESAB), from January to September 2010. We evaluated anti-Leishmania serology by ELISA, employing Soluble Leishmania Antigen (sensitivity 90% and specificity 95%). The presence of parasite DNA was determined by qPCR, targeting a single copy gene (G6PD), and by end-point PCR, targeting multiple targets, namely a segment located in the Leishmania rRNA locus (ITS) and the conserved region of kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) minicircles.Results: The blood-donor population was comprised of 74.5% of males with a mean age of 34 years. Anti-Leishmania serology by ELISA was positive in 5.4% (38/700) individuals. One individual was also positive for Chagas' disease and another tested positive for Syphilis. Employing qPCR, parasite DNA was not found in any of 38 seropositive samples. However, by ITS PCR, 8/38 (21%) samples were positive and this positivity increased to 26/38 (68%) when we targeted kDNA amplification. Agreement between both techniques (ITS and kDNA PCR) was fair (kappa = 0.219).Conclusions: These results indicate that asymptomatic infection is present among the blood donor population of Salvador, a finding that warrants a broader discussion regarding the need to implement specific screening strategies.

Es-Sette, M. Ajaoud, A. Laamrani-Idrissi, F. Mellouki, M. Lemrani;Molecular detection and identification of Leishmania infection in naturally infected sand flies in a focus of cutaneous leishmaniasis in northern Morocco;"Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by various species of the flagellate protozoan Leishmania. During the past 20 years, cutaneous leishmaniasis has emerged as a major public health threat in Morocco. The main objective of this study was to study the occurrence of Leishmania infection in vectors and to identify sand fly blood meal sources in an endemic locality of cutaneous leishmaniasis within Sefrou province, where the vectors of leishmaniasis were still unknown. Methods. 2650 sand flies were collected using CDC miniature light traps and identified morphologically. The identified sand flies were tested for Leishmania infection by nested PCR. The source of blood meal of 10 freshly engorged females: 6 Phlebotomus longicuspis and 4 Phlebotomus sergenti, was determined using the Cyt b sequence. Results: The collected sand flies consisted of 10 species, seven of which belonged to the genus Phlebotomus and three to the genus Sergentomyia. The most abundant species was P. longicuspis, accounting for 72% of the total sand flies collected. In females of three P. longicuspis and four P. sergenti, Leishmania infantum and Leishmania tropica DNA was detected, respectively.The source of blood meal of engorged females showed that all sand flies tested fed on humans. Conclusions: We report for the first time the natural infection of P. longicuspis with L. infantum in Morocco. The high frequency of this species in this region, in addition to its anthropophilic character make P. longicuspis the putative vector of L. infantum in this cutaneous leishmaniasis focus where L. tropica is confirmed as the causative agent of the disease and P. sergenti as its vector. The presence of L. infantum, and its presumed vector in this area, makes this a site of high risk of visceral leishmaniasis, mostly because of the proximity of a focus of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis.

Kroidl, I. Kroidl, G. Bretzel, T. LÃ¶scher;Non-healing old world cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. infantum in a patient from Spain;"Background: The prevalence of Old World Cutaneous Leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean region is increasing and in Southern Europe often caused by Leishmania infantum. Spontaneous healing of cutaneous leishmaniasis is commonly observed, especially if caused by L. major, whereas L. infantum associated lesions have been reported with longer disease duration and decreased tendency for self-limitation, however, available information is sparse.Case presentation: We report the case of an otherwise healthy woman from Southern Spain who presented with a seven years persistent, non-healing, painless, central ulcerated, nodular cutaneous lesion with a diameter of 2 cm of the forearm. Cutaneous leishmaniasis was diagnosed by smear and histology, showing large amounts of leishmania amastigotes in subepidermal histiocytes and extensive lymphocyte and plasma cell inflammation. L. infantum as the causative pathogen was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism and microsatellite-PCR. Systemic or visceral involvement was excluded by negative leishmania serology and clinical presentation, relevant concomitant diseases or immunosuppression were excluded including quantification of immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte phenotyping. Topical and systemic anti-infectious treatment options, often limited in terms of efficacy, tolerability and long lasting treatment duration, were considered. Treatment was successfully performed by surgical extraction in local anaesthesia only.Conclusion: To our knowledge this is the longest reported duration of a L. infantum associated cutaneous leishmaniasis indicating a potential long lasting natural evolution of the disease in an otherwise healthy and immunocompetent patient, however, high parasite density may have reflected a lack of a L. infantum specific immune response. Complete surgical extraction can be successfully performed as treatment.

In Romania between 1955 and 2013, no cases of human autochthonous visceral leishmaniasis were reported. Data regarding canine leishmaniasis is similarly scarce. Since the first report of clinical autochthonous canine leishmaniasis in 1935, there were only three sporadic reports of positive dogs all without any clinical signs. Our study reports the first clinical case of autochthonous canine leishmaniasis in the last 80 years, stressing the importance of a targeted surveillance of Leishmania infection, as infected dogs act as the primary reservoir for zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis.

DomÃ­nguez;Evidence of Leishmania infantum infection in rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) in a natural area in Madrid, Spain;Leishmaniasis is one of the most important neglected zoonosis and remains endemic in at least 88 developing countries in the world. In addition, anthropogenic environmental changes in urban areas are leading to its emergency world wide. Zoonotic leishmaniasis control might only be achieved by an integrated approach targeting both the human host and the animal reservoirs, which in certain sylvatic cycles are yet to be identified. Recently, hares have been pointed out as competent reservoirs of Leishmania infantum in Spain, but the role of other lagomorphs has not been clarified. Here, 69 rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) from a natural area in Madrid in which a high density was present were analyzed using indirect (immunofluorescence antibody test, IFAT) and direct (PCR, culture) techniques. Fifty-seven (82.6%) of the animals were positive to at least one technique, with IFAT yielding the highest proportion of positive samples. L. infantum was isolated in 13% animals demonstrating the occurrence of infection in this setting. Our results suggest that rabbits could play a role of competent reservoir of L. infantum and demonstrate that the prevalence of infection is high in the analyzed area.

El-Mahallawy, B. Kaltenboeck, C. Wang;First report of Babesia gibsoni in Central America and survey for vector-borne infections in dogs from Nicaragua;"Background: Although many vector-borne diseases are important causes of morbidity and mortality in dogs in tropical areas and potential zoonoses, there is little information on these conditions in Central America. Methods. Seven qPCRs for vector-borne pathogens were performed on a Roche LightCycler PCR Instrument to investigate their prevalence in a convenience sample of whole blood samples from apparently healthy dogs in Nicaragua. Also, a qPCR targeting the canine hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) gene was used as an endogenous internal control and verified the quality and quantity of DNA in the samples was appropriate for the study. Results: We found DNA of Rickettsia felis (5%), Babesia spp. (26%), Hepatozoon canis (51%), Anaplasma platys (13%) and Ehrlichia canis (56%) in the 39 dogs studied. The qPCRs for Coxiella burnetii and Dirofilaria immitis were negative. Of the 30 (80%) dogs that were positive by qPCR, 12 (31%) were positive for one agent, 11 (28%) for two, 3 (8%) for three, and 4 (10%) for four agents. Conclusions: This is the first report of B. gibsoni in dogs from Central America and the first recording of vector-borne agents in dogs from Nicaragua. Dogs in Nicaragua are commonly infected with a variety of vector-borne pathogens, some of which may also infect people.

Martins, P. Pinto, M. Nunes, M.L. Vieira, L. Cardoso, L. Campino;Bacterial and protozoal agents of feline vector-borne diseases in domestic and stray cats from southern Portugal;"Background: Feline vector-borne diseases (FVBD) have emerged in recent years, showing a wider geographic distribution and increased global prevalence. In addition to their veterinary importance, domestic cats play a central role in the transmission cycles of some FVBD agents by acting as reservoirs and sentinels, a circumstance that requires a One Health approach. The aim of the present work was to molecularly detect feline vector-borne bacteria and protozoa with veterinary and zoonotic importance, and to assess associated risk factors in cats from southern Portugal. Methods. Six hundred and forty-nine cats (320 domestic and 329 stray), from veterinary medical centres and animal shelters in southern Portugal, were studied. Anaplasma spp./Ehrlichia spp., Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Hepatozoon spp. and Leishmania spp. infections were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood samples. Results: One hundred and ninety-four (29.9%) cats were PCR-positive to at least one of the tested genera or complex of FVBD agents. Sixty-four (9.9%) cats were positive to Leishmania spp., 56 (8.6%) to Hepatozoon spp., 43 (6.6%) to Babesia spp., 35 (5.4%) to Anaplasma spp./Ehrlichia spp., 19 (2.9%) to Bartonella spp. and 14 (2.2%) to B. burgdorferi s.l. Thirty-three (5.1%) cats were positive to two (n = 29) or three (n = 4) genera/complex. Babesia vogeli, Bartonella clarridgeiae, Bartonella henselae, Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon felis and Leishmania infantum were identified by DNA sequencing. Conclusions: The occurrence of FVBD agents in southern Portugal, some of them with zoonotic character, emphasizes the need to alert the veterinary community, owners and public health authorities for the risk of infection. Control measures should be implemented to prevent the infection of cats, other vertebrate hosts and people.

The aim of this study was to survey dogs in Luanda, Angola, for Leishmania infection. Findings. One hundred-and-three dogs presented to a veterinary medical centre in Luanda were serologically and molecularly assessed for Leishmania with the direct agglutination test (DAT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two dogs were seropositive, with DAT titres of 800 and â‰¥6400; the latter was also found to be PCR-positive and confirmed to be infected with L. infantum by DNA sequence analysis. No other dog was found to be PCR-positive. The first dog had been imported from Portugal, but the latter had never left Angola (neither had its parents), strongly suggesting an autochthonous infection. Conclusions: Although other cases of CanL have previously been described in the country, this is the first reported study of canine Leishmania infection at the population level, as well as the first report on the molecular characterization of L. infantum in dogs from Angola.

Montoya;Current status of L. infantum infection in stray cats in the Madrid region (Spain): Implications for the recent outbreak of human leishmaniosis?;"Background: Since 2009, the incidence of human leishmaniosis in the SW of the Madrid region has been unusually high. Although dogs are the main reservoir for this disease, a role played by dogs in this outbreak has been ruled out and investigators are now considering other hosts (eg. cats, rabbits, hares) as possible alternative reservoirs. This study was designed to examine the Leishmania infantum status of stray cats in Madrid to assess its possible implications in the human leishmaniosis outbreak. Methods. 346 captured stray cats were tested for antibodies against L. infantum by the indirect fluorescent antibody technique (IFAT) and nested-PCR methods were used to detect Leishmania DNA in blood samples of cats testing seropositive for L. infantum and/or retroviruses infection. Cats were also tested for Toxoplasma gondii using the direct agglutination test (DAT) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies (PetChek* FIV/FeLV). The presence of intestinal parasites was determined using a routine coprological method. Results: The seroprevalence of L. infantum infection (cut off â‰¥ 1/100) was 3.2% (11/346). However, it was not possible to amplify Leishmania DNA in any of the blood samples. Seropositivity was not associated with sex, age, capture site, clinical status, retrovirus infection or T. gondii seropositivity. Of the 11 cats seropositive for L. infantum, 3 also tested positive for FIV, none for FeLV and 6 for T. gondii. It should be mentioned that the prevalence of FeLV p27 antigen was 4% and of FIV antibody was 9.2%. Although the seroprevalence of T. gondii was quite high at 53.5%, no T. gondii oocysts were found in any of the faeces samples analysed (n = 287). In contrast, intestinal parasites were detected in 76 (26.5%) samples, Toxocara cati being the most prevalent. Conclusions: Our results suggest a stable L. infantum infection situation among the stray cats of the Madrid area; the disease is uncommon and no clinical cases have been reported to date. The detection of other zoonotic parasites such as T. gondii and T. cati in stray cats indicates a need to adopt strict control measures in this population.

According to this program, monitoring activities were performed to verify the presence of sandflies and infected dogs, and a specific CanL risk class was assigned to each kennel, resulting in different control approaches (entomological and/or serological monitoring, clinical surveillance, therapeutic treatment of infected dogs, protections against vector bites). From 2007 to 2012, 20,931 dogs, 89.8% of which were identified by microchip and housed in 73 kennels, were examined using an indirect fluorescent antibody test. In all, 528 (2.8%) dogs tested positive, and 43.0% of these were asymptomatic. The authors used monitoring results, in particular serological tests performed on dogs at admittance to the kennel and annual controls of sentinel dogs, to estimate CanL risk in the whole region and to evaluate the efficacy of the preventive measures adopted. CanL seroprevalence in dogs tested at the admittance in kennels increased significantly from 2010 (1.0%; 29/2858) to 2012 (2.4%; 69/2841). In contrast, the number of seroconversions in sentinel dogs was stable in 2010 (1.2%; 11/896) and 2011 (1.6%; 13/825) and decreased in 2012 (0.9%; 8/850), suggesting the efficacy of the preventive measures applied.

Rehbein;Survey of Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum, haemotropic mycoplasmas and other arthropod-borne pathogens in cats from Albania;"Background: Albania is a country on the western part of the Balkan Peninsula. The Mediterranean climate is favourable for the stable development of many arthropod species, which are incriminated as vectors for various agents. Recently, several papers have reported on epidemiological aspects of parasitic diseases including vector-borne disease agents of dogs with zoonotic characteristics in Albania. However, data on the epidemiology of feline parasitic and bacterial agents in Albania is scarce. Methods. Serum and EDTA-blood samples collected from 146 domestic cats from Tirana during 2008 through 2010 were examined for exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Leishmania infantum, and Anaplasma spp. with IFAT, for infection with L. infantum, A. phagocytophilum, Bartonella spp. and haemotropic mycoplasmas with conventional PCR and real-time PCR and for Dirofilaria immitis with antigen ELISA. Additionally blood smear microscopy was carried out for detection of blood-borne pathogens. Results: Antibodies to T. gondii (titre â‰¥1:100) were demonstrated in 91 cats (62.3%). Antibodies to N. caninum (titre â‰¥1:100), L. infantum (titre â‰¥1:64) and Anaplasma spp. (titre â‰¥1:100) were found in the serum of 15 (10.3%), 1 (0.7%) or 3 (2.1%) cats, respectively. DNA of haemotropic mycoplasmas was detected in the blood of 45 cats (30.8%), namely Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum (21.9%), Mycoplasma haemofelis (10.3%), and Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis (5.5%), with ten cats harbouring co-infections of two mycoplasmas each; blood from one cat was PCR positive for Bartonella henselae. No DNA of Leishmania spp. and A. phagocytophilum or circulating D. immitis antigen was detected in any cat sample. The overall prevalence of haemotropic mycoplasmas was significantly higher in male compared to female cats (40.6% vs. 24.1%, p = 0.0444); and age was associated positively with the prevalence of antibodies to T. gondii (p = 0.0008) and the percentage of haemotropic mycoplasma infection (p = 0.0454). Conclusions: With the broad screening panel including direct and indirect methods applied in the present study, a wide spectrum of exposure to or infection with parasitic or bacterial agents was detected.

Tarallo, E.B. Breitshwerdt, F. Dantas-Torres, D. Stanneck, D. Otranto;Incidence of Cercopithifilaria bainae in dogs and probability of co-infection with other tick-borne pathogens;Background: Cercopithifilaria bainae is a filarioid parasite that infects dogs, being transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus group ticks in many countries of the Mediterranean basin. This study assessed the incidence density rate (IDR) of infection by C. bainae in dogs and the probability of co-infection with other tick-borne pathogens (i.e., Anaplasma platys, Babesia vogeli and Hepatozoon canis), in an area of high endemicity in southern Italy. Methodology/Principal Findings: From March 2011 to October 2012, a field study involving 58 young dogs naturally exposed to tick infestation was conducted. Skin and blood samples obtained from each dog six times during an 18-month period were tested for C. bainae by parasite detection within skin snip sediments, with subsequent confirmation through PCR and DNA sequencing. Dogs examined monthly for ticks and A. platys, B. vogeli and H. canis were microscopically and/or molecularly diagnosed and after the first and the second summer seasons, the IDR for positive animal-month at risk was 3.8% and 1.7% in November 2011 and October 2012, respectively. All 58 C. bainae-infected dogs were simultaneously infected with at least one other tick-borne pathogen. After the first summer season (assessment in November 2011), a C. bainae-infected dog had a 33% probability of being infected with H. canis or A. platys, whereas after the second tick season (assessment in October 2012) the probability of co-infection was 78%, 22% and 11% for H. canis, A. platys and B. vogeli, respectively. Conclusions: Our data indicate that tick-infested dogs are at risk of acquiring infection by C. bainae. In addition, the detection of C. bainae microfilariae indicates a prior tick exposure and, should stimulate testing for other tick-borne disease causing pathogens.

DomÃ­nguez;Detection of anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies in sylvatic lagomorphs from an epidemic area of Madrid using the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test;An outbreak of human leishmaniosis was confirmed in the southwest of the province of Madrid, Spain, between July 2009 and December 2012. Incidence of Leishmania infection in dogs was unchanged in this period, prompting a search for alternative sylvatic infection reservoirs. We evaluated exposure to Leishmania in serum samples from animals in the area with an indirect immunofluorescence test (IFAT). Using promastigotes from six culture passages and a 1/25 threshold titer, we found anti- Leishmania infantum seroreactivity in 9.3% of cats (4 of 43), 45.7% of rabbits (16/35) and 74.1% of hares (63/85). Use of promastigotes from >10 in vitro passages resulted in a notably IFAT lower titer, suggesting antigenic changes during extended culture. Postmortem inspection of seropositive animals showed no clinical signs of infection. The results clearly suggest that asymptomatic hares were the main reservoir in the outbreak, and corroborate IFAT as a sensitive serological surveillance method to detect such cryptic Leishmania infections.

Demographic data, clinical signs, packed cell volume values, and the presence of tick infestation were recorded for each dog. Forty seven percent (69/146) of the dogs were infected with at least one pathogen and 12% were co-infected with two pathogens. Ehrlichia canis was detected in 34%, Anaplasma platys in 10%, Babesia vogeli in 8%, and Hepatozoon canis in 7.5% of the blood samples. No infection was detected with Leishmania spp. in blood, skin scrapings or conjunctival swabs. Thirty percent of the dogs presented at least one clinical sign compatible with vector-borne disease, and of those, 66% were infected with a pathogen. Subclinical infections were determined in 58% of the infected dogs including 82% (9/11), 58% (29/50), 42% (5/12) and 36% (5/14) of the dogs with H. canis, E. canis, B. vogeli and A. platys infections, respectively. A distinct relationship was found between infection and anemia. The mean PCV values were 34.4% in dogs with no infection, 31.5% in those who had a single infection and 23% in those with co-infection. Co-infected dogs had significantly lower PCV values compared to non-infected and single-infected dogs (p<. 0.0001). Thirty five percent (51/146) of the dogs were infested with ticks, 82% of them were infested with Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato and 18% with Amblyomma ovale. Dogs infected with A. platys, B. vogeli, or E. canis were significantly associated with R. sanguineus s.l. infestation (p<. 0.029).This is the first description of infections with B. vogeli and H. canis in Costa Rica as well as in Central America. The results of this study indicate that multiple vector-borne pathogens responsible for severe diseases infect dogs in Costa Rica and therefore, increased owner and veterinarian awareness are needed. Moreover, prevention of tick infestation is recommended to decrease the threat of these diseases to the canine population.

Pumarola, S. AÃ±or;Intramedullary spinal cord mass presumptively associated with leishmaniasis in a dog;"Case Description-A 9-year-old male Miniature Poodle was evaluated because of progressive severe right hemiparesis, right forelimb lameness, and signs of cervical pain. Clinical Findings-A low body condition score (2/9) and popliteal lymphadenopathy were detected. Results of a CBC, serum biochemical analyses, urinalysis, cytologic examination of bone marrow and popliteal lymph node aspirates, and serum ELISA were consistent with systemic leishmaniasis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spinal cord revealed an intramedullary mass extending from the caudal aspect of the C5 vertebral body to the C5-6 intervertebral disk space with a contrast medium-enhanced pattern that had 3 zones (central contrast medium-enhanced core, intermediate isointense zone, and peripheral contrast medium-enhanced ring). Surgical biopsy of the mass was performed by means of a right C5-6 dorsal hemilaminectomy. Results of PCR assays for detection of Leishmania DNA in CSF and tissue biopsy samples were positive. Treatment and Outcome-Treatment for systemic leishmaniasis was initiated. Two months later, body condition, neurologic signs, and gait of the dog had substantially improved; the dog had mild right forelimb paresis at that time. Results of follow-up MRI indicated resolution of the cervical spinal cord lesion. Four months after diagnosis, the dog's neurologic condition was stable. Clinical Relevance-To the authors' knowledge, this report is the first in which clinical findings, clinicopathologic data, and MRI characteristics of an intramedullary inflammatory spinal cord lesion presumptively attributable to leishmaniasis in a dog have been reported, and the first report of CNS leishmaniasis in a dog with MRI resolution and a successful clinical response to treatment.";;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;10.2460/javma.244.2.200;;;;204;;;;;;;2;Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association;antiprotozoal agent,protozoal DNA,animal,animal disease,article,case report,cerebrospinal fluid,dog,dog disease,isolation and purification,Leishmania infantum,male,parasitology,pathology,spinal cord disease,visceral leishmaniasis,Animals,Antiprotozoal Agents,DNA, Protozoan,Dog Diseases,Dogs,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Male,Spinal Cord Diseases;;Cited By :8,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;200;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84891707036&doi=10.2460%2fjavma.244.2.200&partnerID=40&md5=ae900a774e9ab1c173511f9e3f000662;244;2014;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Tampieri, R. Galuppi;Molecular evidence of Leishmania infantum in ixodes ricinus ticks from dogs and cats, in Italy;"Leishmaniosis, caused by Leishmania infantum, is an endemic zoonosis in the Mediterranean basin. To date, phlebotomine sand flies are the only accepted biological vectors of Leishmania parasites to dogs and humans. The absence of the primary vector in autochthonous Leishmania outbreaks suggests a possible role of fleas or ticks as alternative vectors. In this study, 119 ticks were collected between August 2007-June 2008 and between March 2010-October 2010 from various animal species and humans living in Italian areas where canine leishmaniosis is endemic (i.e. rural areas of the North) and were tested for the presence of L. infantum DNA. Nine (7.5%) out of 119 ticks resulted PCR positive. All ticks were morphologically identified as Ixodes ricinus ticks, 3 from 1 cat, 6 from 4 dogs. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of L. infantum DNA in ticks from cat, suggesting that the debate about the epidemiological role of ticks in canine leishmaniosis might be extended to feline leishmaniosis.

DNA was obtained from blood samples collected from 346 local dogs from both genders and various ages. Seventeen PCR products from positive blood samples of urban dogs and 13 from the rural dogs were sequenced. Partial sequences of the 18S rRNA gene indicated that all 30 dogs were infected with Hepatozoon canis similar in sequence to H. canis from southern Europe.

Tognetti, M. Corazza;Seroprevalence of leishmania sp. infection in healthy horses housed in endemic areas in Tuscany;"This study carried out an epidemiological survey of seroprevalence of positive immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) results for Leishmania infantum in horses living in Tuscany, where the disease in the dog is endemic and no cases of equine leishmaniasis were observed. Inclusion criteria were (1) horses housed for more than 2 years in endemic areas; (2) horses grazing 24 hours a day outside; and (3) horses living on farms where affected dogs were housed. Two blood samples each were collected from 277 horses from June to October 2011 (T1) and from December 2011 to February 2012 (T2), and IFAT was performed for L. infantum. A dermatologic examination was performed to detect the presence of skin lesions. No animals had skin abnormalities. At T1, 18 of 277 horses had positive results for IFAT, while at the second sampling (T2) 277 of 277 samples were negative. In conclusion, our seroprevalence is lower than that in Spain but higher than that in Greece. Our results suggest the presence of a transient humoral response to L. infantum in horses.

However, circumstantial evidence has indicated urban transmission of leishmaniasis and phleboviruses in the urban area of Marseille, France. To investigate this urban transmission, sandflies were trapped in 33 locations in the urban area (horse farms, public gardens and a residential area). Sandflies were always captured: 87.8% were Phlebotomus perniciosus, a vector of Leishmania infantum and Toscana and Massilia viruses. RT-PCR and cell culture inoculation identified the Massilia virus in 2/99 pools of sandflies, and PCR identified Leishmania in 5/99. No dual infection was observed, but both pathogens were detected in samples from the same trapping site.

Giannelli, D. Carbone, G. Baneth, F. Dantas-Torres, D. Otranto;Occurrence of Hepatozoon canis and Cercopithifilaria bainae in an off-host population of Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato ticks;"Hepatozoon canis (Eucoccidiorida, Hepatozoidae) and the filarioid Cercopithifilaria bainae (Spirurida, Onchocercidae) are tick-transmitted infectious agents of dogs, highly prevalent in the Mediterranean basin in association with Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato. Ticks were collected from the environment every 25. Â±. 2 days in a confined location in southern Italy where a community of dogs lives, from August 2012 to July 2013. In order to study the occurrence of H. canis and C. bainae, 1091 tick specimens (770 adults; 271 nymphs, and 50 larvae) were dissected, and oocysts of H. canis and larvae of C. bainae were morphologically identified. Out of 1091 dissected ticks, 13.47% (n= 147) were positive for H. canis, with the highest prevalence recorded in unfed adults (16.4%; 126/770), followed by nymphs collected as larvae and allowed to moult (14%; 7/50), unfed nymphs dissected immediately after collection (3%; 8/271), and adults collected as nymphs and allowed to moult (2%; 6/271). The highest number of H. canis-positive ticks (35.5%; 43/121; P<. 0.05) was recorded during the summer months (i.e., June-July). In addition, 6% of adult ticks (n= 66) were positive for third-stage larvae of C. bainae, with the highest number in June (17%; 14/84; P<. 0.05). Based on the results reported herein, H. canis and C. bainae infections in the study area seem to be dependent on the seasonality of vector tick populations. Hence, dogs living in these areas are more exposed to both pathogens during the warmer months. These findings provide new insights into the ecology of both H. canis and C. bainae.

Cardoso;Molecular detection of bacterial and parasitic pathogens in hard ticks from Portugal;Ticks are important vector arthropods of human and animal pathogens. As information about agents of disease circulating in vectors in Portugal is limited, the aim of the present study was to detect bacteria and parasites with veterinary and zoonotic importance in ticks collected from dogs, cats, and field vegetation. A total of 925 ticks, comprising 888 (96.0%) adults, 8 (0.9%) nymphs, and 29 (3.1%) larvae, were collected in 4 geographic areas (districts) of Portugal. Among those, 620 (67.0%) were removed from naturally infested dogs, 42 (4.5%) from cats, and 263 (28.4%) were questing ticks obtained from field vegetation. Rhipicephalus sanguineus was the predominant tick species, and the only one collected from dogs and vegetation, while all Ixodes ricinus specimens ( n= 6) were recovered from cats. Rickettsia massiliae and Rickettsia conorii were identified in 35 ticks collected from cats and dogs and in 3 ticks collected from dogs. Among ticks collected from cats or dogs, 4 Rh. sanguineus specimens were detected with Hepatozoon felis, 3 with Anaplasma platys, 2 with Hepatozoon canis, one with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, one with Babesia vogeli, one with Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato and one with Cercopithifilaria spp. Rickettsia helvetica was detected in one I. ricinus tick collected from a cat. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time that Cercopithifilaria spp., Ba. vogeli, H. canis, and H. felis have been detected in ticks from Portugal. The wide range of tick-borne pathogens identified, some of zoonotic concern, suggests a risk for the emergence of tick-borne diseases in domestic animals and humans in Portugal. Further studies on these and other tick-borne agents should be performed to better understand their epidemiological and clinical importance, and to support the implementation of effective control measures.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection among humans and domestic dogs by using direct agglutination test (DAT) and PCR assays in the eastern zone of the province. Between 2011 and 2012, blood samples were randomly collected from 450 humans and 50 domestic dogs, in the eastern zone of Golestan Province including 7 villages from Marave-tappeh district where new cases of human VL had been recorded there. Each of these samples was tested for anti-Leishmania antibodies, in DAT, and for L. infantum kinetoplast DNA on whole blood, in PCR-based assays. A total of 450 human samples, 6 (1.33 %) were found seropositive and 13 (2.8 %) was found PCR-positive. Of the 50 dog samples, 16 (32 %) were found seropositive and 15 (30 %) were PCR-positive. All PCR-positive dogs were found seropositive except one as well as 6 (46.2 %) PCR-positive humans were also found seropositive. Moreover, the species of L. infantum was detected in all PCR-positive samples. The high prevalence of VL in the study areas offer it has emerged as an endemic focus in the province. Further investigations on the vectors, reservoirs and human population are recommended.

Welc-Faleciak;The risk of vector-borne infections in sled dogs associated with existing and new endemic areas in Poland. Part 1: A population study on sled dogs during the racing season.;"The achievements of sled dogs in competitions depend both on their training and on their health. Vector-borne infections may lead to anaemia, affect joints or heart muscle or even cause death. Between December 2009 and October 2010, one hundred and twenty six individual blood samples were collected from 26 sled dog kennels situated in different regions of Poland. The majority of samples were taken during the racing season (winter 2009/10). The prevalences of 3 vector-borne infections- including 2 'old pathogens' Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Babesia canis, and 'new pathogen' Hepatozoon canis-were estimated in sled dogs using PCR and nested PCR. Additionally, 25 serum samples originating from a subset of 3 kennels situated in a tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) endemic area (Mazowiecki region), were tested for antibodies against the tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV). Because of the recently reported occurrence of Dirofilaria repens in Central Poland and that of fatal cases of unknown aetiology in two of the kennels, blood samples collected from dogs at these kennels in 2010 and in February-May 2013 and from two unaffected kennels were checked for evidence of presence of this parasite. Babesia canis DNA was detected in 11 sled dogs (4 with clinical babesiosis, 7 asymptomatic; 8.7%) inhabiting mainly endemic regions of Poland (9/11 cases). Three serum samples originating from one location tested positive for TBEV antibodies (total seroprevalence: 3/25 = 12%, local seroprevalence: 3/12 = 25%). The risk of TBEV infection was associated with previous B. canis infections. Dirofilaria repens DNA was detected in 15 dogs (44%). Prevalence was especially high in two sled dog kennels situated near Grodzisk Mazowiecki (50-57%). No blood samples tested positive for A. phagocytophilum or H. canis DNA. The present study has established that the prevalence of vector-borne pathogens in working sled dogs is significant in the endemic regions and has justified the important role of surveillance of reservoir hosts in the epidemiology of TBE. Our results emphasize the need for regular monitoring for the presence of D. repens.

Saridomichelakis;Cytological and molecular detection of Leishmania infantum in different tissues of clinically normal and sick cats;"Natural infection of domestic cats by Leishmania infantum (synonym: L. chagasi) has been demonstrated in several European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and the estimated prevalence of infection, based mainly on blood PCR, ranges from 0.3% up to 60.6%. In this study we aimed to: (a) estimate the prevalence of the infection by L. infantum in clinically normal cats (group A; n = 50) and in cats with various clinical signs (group B; n = 50), living in an endemic region, by both cytological examination of four different tissues (lymph node, skin, bone marrow, and conjunctiva) and by PCR in four different tissues (blood, skin biopsies, bone marrow, and conjunctiva); (b) compare the diagnostic sensitivity of the above methods and evaluate for possible associations between their results; and (c) investigate the possible associations between infection by L. infantum and signalment, living conditions, season of sampling, and health status of the cats. The prevalence of the infection in the study population was 41% and did not differ (P = 0.839) between group A (42%) and B (40%) cats. Lymph node, skin, bone marrow and conjunctiva cytology was always negative. Therefore, the diagnosis of the infection was based only on PCR in blood, skin biopsy, bone marrow and conjunctiva, which was positive in 13%, 18.2%, 16% and 3.1% of the cats, respectively. PCR was positive in only one of the four tissues in 80.5% of the infected cats. The results differed (P = 0.014) among the four tissues and were less frequently positive in conjunctiva compared to skin biopsies and bone marrow (P = 0.007 for both comparisons), thus highlighting the need for multiple tissue PCR testing in order to minimize false-negative results.

Also, in group B cats, the likelihood of PCR-positivity was higher (odds ratio: 3.93; P = 0.042) among those presenting at least one systemic clinical sign that had been previously reported in cats with leishmaniosis.

Best, A. Ash, J. Bergfeld, J. Barrett;The diagnosis and management of a case of leishmaniosis in a dog imported to Australia;This case study discusses in detail for the first time the diagnosis and management of a case of leishmaniosis in a dog imported to Australia. The dog presented with epistaxis and a non-regenerative anaemia five years after being imported from Europe. Protozoa were identified within macrophages in bone marrow and splenic cytology. A Leishmania indirect fluorescent antibody test was performed and was positive while an Ehrlichia canis antibody test was negative. Polymerase chain reaction of the ITS-1 and ITS-2 regions of skin, lymph node, spleen and bone marrow were all positive for Leishmania infantum. The dog was treated with amphotericin B with a strong clinical response. The importance of thorough diagnostics in non-endemic areas, particularly Australia, is discussed. Treatment with amphotericin B is discussed. Vigilance, disease reporting and response frameworks are recommended for non-endemic areas.

Molecular detection of tick-borne pathogens in Rhipicephalus sanguineus group ticks Ticks and Tick-borne Diseases, 5(6),  943; M.S. Latrofa, F. Dantas-Torres, A. Giannelli, D. Otranto;Molecular detection of tick-borne pathogens in Rhipicephalus sanguineus group ticks;The Rhipicephalus sanguineus group includes some of the most widespread dog ticks, whose identification currently represents a difficult task due to the morphological similarities of these ixodid species. Recently, following the morphological and molecular characterization of tick specimens collected from dogs in all continents, Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (s.l.), Rhipicephalus turanicus and three different operational taxonomic units (namely Rhipicephalus sp. I-III) have been identified. Therefore, a comprehensive molecular study has been herein carried out to detect selected canine vector-borne pathogens (i.e., Anaplasma platys, Cercopithifilaria spp., Ehrlichia canis and Hepatozoon canis) in ticks belonging to the R. sanguineus group. A total of 204 tick specimens from dogs were examined and identified as R. sanguineus s.l. (. n=. 81), R. turanicus (. n=. 17), Rhipicephalus sp. I (. n=. 66), Rhipicephalus sp. II (. n=. 37), and Rhipicephalus sp. III (. n=. 3). PCR assays were performed to detect mitochondrial and ribosomal target genes of Cercopithifilaria spp., A. platys, E. canis and H. canis. Out of 204 specimens examined, 2.5%, 7.4% and 21.6% scored positive to A. platys, H. canis and Cercopithifilaria spp., respectively. In addition, co-infections with two pathogens (i.e., Cercopithifilaria bainae and A. platys or H. canis) were detected in four tick specimens. This study suggests a relationship between ticks belonging to the R. sanguineus group and the geographical distribution of A. platys, H. canis and Cercopithifilaria spp. However, the role of each representative tick species within the R. sanguineus group in the transmission of these canine pathogens needs to be further investigated.

This study aimed to carry out a serological survey of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in dogs housed at a public kennel in the municipality of Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, using the immunochromatographic TR DPPÂ® CVL rapid test. Additionally, conventional and/or real time PCR assay was used to detect and confirm L. infantum infection in the DPP positive dogs only. Of the 400 dogs studied, most did not present clinical signs for CVL (p < 0.05), and fifteen (3.8%) were seropositive in the DPP test. There was no statistically significant difference between the DPP seropositive dogs and the clinical signs of the disease (p > 0.05). Both conventional and real time PCR tests confirmed L. infantum infection in nine (75.0%) of the twelve DPP seropositive dogs that remained alive during the follow-up period. This study is the first seroepidemiologic survey of CVL held in the city of Juiz de Fora, and the results reinforce the idea that this disease is currently in a process of expansion and urbanization in Brazil. Furthermore, this study highlights the use of the DPP test as an alternative for diagnosing CVL in large and mid-sized cities, due to its ease of implementation.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;10.1590/S0036-46652014000300008;;;;229;;;;;;;3;Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo;Canine visceral leishmaniasis,DPP,Immunochromatographic diagnosis,PCR diagnosis,Serological diagnosis,article,Brazil,canine visceral leishmaniasis,comparative study,diagnostic test accuracy study,dog disease,follow up,immunoaffinity chromatography,Leishmania infantum,leishmaniasis rapid test,nonhuman,polymerase chain reaction,real time polymerase chain reaction,seroepidemiology,Animals,Antibodies, Protozoan,Brazil,Dog Diseases,Dogs,Immunochromatography,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Seroepidemiologic Studies;;Cited By :5,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;225;;;;;;;EvidÃªncia de infecÃ§Ã£o por Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum em cÃ£es de Juiz de Fora, Minas Gerais, Brasil, detectada pelo teste imunocromatogrÃ¡fico rÃ¡pido DPP e PCR;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901747205&doi=10.1590%2fS0036-46652014000300008&partnerID=40&md5=563e9ef5ef32d48a43c35ed63ae68ea0;56;2014;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Zhioua;Interaction between canine and human visceral leishmaniases in a holoendemic focus of Central Tunisia;Canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is endemic in the Mediterranean basin. In Tunisia, CVL is spatially associated with human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) affecting mostly children younger than 5 years old. In this study, seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum infection in dogs was assessed in highly endemic districts of the governorate of Kairouan where more than 50% of HVL cases in Tunisia were reported. An entomological investigation was also carried out in two endemic districts (Bouhajla and Haffouz) to assess sand fly fauna and infection status of sand flies with Leishmania. A total of 191 serum samples were collected from healthy dogs and tested for anti- L. infantum antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). Overall seroprevalence for L. infantum was 26.7% being highest among dogs in the district of Bouhajla (52.7%) and the lowest in the district of Chbika (5.2%). In dogs, seroprevalence did not differ significantly based on gender or age, with dogs younger than 1 year showing a higher seroprevalence compared to older dogs. These findings suggest strong force of infection in naÃ¯ve animals in holoendemic regions leading to emerging high incidence of HVL. Concomitant to the high CVL prevalence observed in the Bouhajla district, a significantly high cumulative HVL incidence also was observed in this district. Phlebotomus perniciosus and Phlebotomus longicuspis were the most abundant sand fly species in Bouhajla and Haffouz districts. The rate of Leishmania-DNA infection in sand flies was 9.4%. This finding points to spatial correlation between the occurrence of disease in humans, a high rate of infection in dogs and a high abundance of P. pernicious and P. longicuspis. Thus, CVL is the main risk factor for transmission to humans and subsequently, it is an important parameter for controlling transmission to humans.

Lia, D. Otranto;Ecology of phlebotomine sand flies and Leishmania infantum infection in a rural area of southern Italy;Phlebotomine sand flies are insects of major medico-veterinary significance in the Mediterranean region, as they may transmit pathogens to animals and humans, including viruses and protozoa. The present study was conducted in southern Italy, in an area where visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum is endemic. Insects were collected monthly during two consecutive years using light traps set in five different ecologic contexts (i.e., a stonewall near a woodhouse, a tree near volcanic rocks in a high-altitude area, a tree trunk in a meadow habitat, a sheep stable, and a chicken coop) and weekly in one site (the garage of a private house). A total of 13,087 specimens were collected and six species identified (i.e., Phlebotomus perfiliewi, Phlebotomus perniciosus, Phlebotomus neglectus, Phlebotomus papatasi, Phlebotomus mascittii, and Sergentomyia minuta), representing 75% of the total number of phlebotomine species found in Italy. P. perfiliewi was the most abundant species, comprising 88.14% of the specimens identified. The greatest species diversity and abundance was recorded in human dwellings and in animal sheds. Sand flies were active from June to October, peaking in July-August in 2010 and July-September in 2011. Part of the females (n=8865) was grouped into 617 pools (range, 1-10 insects each) according to species, feeding status, day and site of collection. A total of four pools (10 non-engorged specimens each) and one engorged female of P. perfiliewi were positive for L. infantum. This study confirms that phlebotomine vectors in southern Italy are highly adapted to human-modified environments (e.g., animal sheds) and that P. perfiliewi is a major vector of L. infantum in some regions of southern Italy.

Aboltins;"A case of imported Leishmania infantum cutaneous leishmaniasis; an unusual presentation occurring 19 years after travel";Background: Leishmania infantum is a flagellated protozoan parasite that is able to parasitize blood and tissue. Leishmania species cause a spectrum of clinical disease with cutaneous, visceral or mucosal involvement. L. infantum is recognised as a cause of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and is less commonly reported as a cause of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from countries around the Mediterranean basin. This is the first report of imported L. infantum CL to Australia and is remarkable for a 19 year period between the patient's exposure to an endemic region, and the manifestation of symptoms. Case presentation: A 76 year old Italian-born man presented to our institution with a non-healing lesion over his upper lip, abutting his nasal mucosa. The patient had travelled to Italy, an endemic area for L. infantum 19 years earlier but had resided in Australia, a non-endemic area since. Histopathology performed on a biopsy of the lesion demonstrated findings consistent with CL. A species specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed on the tissue detected L. infantum. The patient had complete clinical recovery following treatment with Liposomal amphotericin B at a dose of 3 mg/kg for five days followed by a subsequent 3 mg/kg dose at day ten. Conclusions: L. infantum should be recognised as a cause of imported CL in returned travellers from the Mediterranean. In this case, the incubation period for L. infantum CL was at least 19 years. This case adds to the described spectrum of clinical presentations of leishmaniasis and supports the theory of parasite persistence underlying natural immunity and recurrence of disease. Clinicians should consider L. infantum CL in the differential diagnosis of a non-healing skin lesion in any patient who reports travel to the Mediterranean, even when travel occurred several years before clinical presentation.

HIV infections were detected by ELISA and confirmed using western blot assay at the AIDS centre of the Khorasan Razavi Province. All collected sera were screened using the direct agglutination test (DAT). The sera with anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies at a titre of 1:100 were considered positive for VL infection and serum titration was performed from 1:100 to 1:102,400. Nine (18.4%) patients were sero-positive according to DAT. The distribution of sera titrations were as follows: 1:100 (n = 6) 1:1600 (n = 1); 1:25,600 (n = 1) and 1:102,400 (n = 1). All sero-positive cases showed clinical signs and symptoms. The most predominant signs and symptoms of co-infection of visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-positive patients were pneumonia (n = 2), hepatosplenomegaly (n = 2), lymphadenopathy (n = 2), anaemia (n = 1), prolonged fever (n = 1) and cachexia (n = 1).

Methods: A total of 179 patients with HIV infection were screened for the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies using indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) (Leishmania-spot IF; bioMeÂ´ rieux, Marcy lâ€™Etoile, France). All patients were followed up for at least 1 year. The primary end-point was to confirm the presence of Leishmania infection. Results: Significant titer of antibodies to Leishmania was detected in six (3%; 95% confidence interval: 0.5â€“5.5%) asymptomatic patients. Two of them had visceral leishmaniasis that was confirmed by parasite visualization in clinical samples, the presence of Leishmania promastigotes in Novyâ€“MacNealâ€“Nicolle culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, and/or urinary antigen test. Among 173 patients with indirect immunofluorescent antibody test below 1: 40, one HIV-infected patient severely immunosuppressed, confirmed negative by IFAT, was diagnosed of visceral leishmaniasis. Conclusion: The use of indirect immunofluorescent antibody test for Leishmania screening is not justified in asymptomatic patients with HIV infection living in endemic areas due to the small rate of significant antibody titer and the low frequency of clinical disease.

Veras;First case of autochthonous human visceral leishmaniasis in the urban center of Rio de Janeiro: Case report;Visceral leishmaniasis is an anthropozoonosis that is caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania, especially Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum, and is transmitted to humans by the bite of sandflies of the genus Lutzomyia, such as Lutzomyia longipalpis. There are many reservoirs, including Canis familiaris. It is a chronic infectious disease with systemic involvement that is characterized by three phases: the initial period, the state period and the final period. The main symptoms are fever, malnutrition, hepatosplenomegaly, and pancytopenia. This article reports a case of a patient diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis in the final period following autochthonous transmission in the urban area of Rio de Janeiro. The case reported here is considered by the Municipal Civil Defense and Health Surveillance of Rio de Janeiro to be the first instance of autochthonous visceral leishmaniasis in humans in the urban area of this city. The patient was discharged and is undergoing a follow-up at the outpatient clinic, demonstrating clinical improvement.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;10.1590/S0036-46652014000100013;;;;84;;;;;;;1;Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo;Epidemiology,Transmission,Visceral leishmaniasis,Adult,Brazil,Cities,Humans,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Male,Urban Population;;Cited By :6,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;81;;;;;;;Primeiro caso de leishmaniose visceral humana de transmissÃ£o autÃ³ctone no centro urbano do Rio de Janeiro: Relato de caso;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894103610&doi=10.1590%2fS0036-46652014000100013&partnerID=40&md5=e2bd8f800af104f557a67169dc0fbe2c;56;2014;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Methods: Blood samples of 602 dogs living in 11 counties of Tehran and Alborz Provinces were taken by venipuncture in 2008-2010. After separation of blood sera, anti-leishmanial antibodies were detected by direct agglutination test (DAT). Results: Overall, of the 408 and 194 serum samples collected randomly from dogs in 11 localities in Tehran and Alborz Provinces, 18/408 (4.41%) and 12/194 (6.18%) respectively were found positive. Among the localities, Shemiran in Tehran Province and Karaj In Alborz Province had the highest prevalence rates. No statistically significant differences were found between sex and living place but there was significant difference between living status (owned or stray) and CVL infection of dogs in Alborz Province (P= 0.018). The highest seroprevalence (7.5%) was found in dogs aged 3 to 5 years old. Only 20% of the seropositive dogs were symptomatic. Conclusion: Concerning possible human infections in Tehran and Alborz Provinces, both symptomatic and asymptomatic seropositive dogs should be considered as a risk.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;;;;;138;;;;;;;2;Journal of Arthropod-Borne Diseases;Direct Agglutination Test,Dog,Iran,Visceral leishmaniasis,age,agglutination test,alopecia,animal tissue,article,cachexia,dog,epistaxis,female,gender,geographic distribution,Iran,Leishmania infantum,lethargy,male,myopathy,nonhuman,nucleotide sequence,seroprevalence,skin defect,species distribution,vein puncture,visceral leishmaniasis;;Cited By :5,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;132;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899516689&partnerID=40&md5=0f1cf310ecab2c7104dd8beb4e5faae6;8;2014;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

The cat was imported from Spain 4 years earlier and was initially presented with chronic uveitis. Laboratory test results were negative for feline immunodefi ciency virus (FIV), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and Toxoplasma gondii, as well as for Bartonella haenselae and Leishmania spp. Twenty-one months later the cat was presented again because of development of keratitis and granulomatous blepharitis. Blood cell count revealed severe Pancytopenia; Cytology of fi ne needle aspirates of granulomatous lesions on both upper eyelids and of a corneal smear revealed intracytoplasmatic microorganisms. A preliminary diagnosis of leishmaniasis was supported by positive polymerase chain reaction from bone marrow and eyelid samples for Leishmania infantum DNA and by a high serum antibody titer for Leishmania spp. Treatment with Allopurinol (10 mg/kg, BID) orally led to rapid improvement of ocular signs, general condition and blood cell count with complete remission of lid and corneal lesions within 2 months of treatment.

Mahshid, A. Baharak, S. Iraj, K. Sina, K. Javad, B. Mehdi;Seroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis in southeast of Iran;"Visceral leishmaniasis is an endemic disease in many parts of Iran and infected dogs constitute the main domestic reservoirs that play a key role in transmission to humans. The objective of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in southeast of Iran. This survey was carried out from 2009 to 2011 in Kerman, Bam and Baft districts in Kerman province and Zabol in Sistan-Baluchestan province. Blood samples were taken from 201 dogs after complete clinical examination. Following hematological evaluation; collected sera were tested by indirect ELISA method for the presence of anti Leishmania infantum antibodies. Overall seroprevalence was 15.4 %, including 6.4, 3.5, 3 and 2.4 % in Bam, Zabol, Baft and Kerman, respectively. However, seroprevalence of disease was not significantly related to age, gender, presence of clinical signs and hematological disorders. Based to the results of the present study, CVL is endemic in southeastern Iran. Delayed diagnosis and euthanasia of potentially infectious animals may occur with an increased transmission risk to sand flies and subsequently to humans. Implementation of potent screening tests with high validity is essential for rapid detection and successful dog elimination programs in endemic parts of Iran.

Blood samples were collected from 32 dogs from different rural properties (small farms) and were analyzed by ELISA and the indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) in order to diagnose CVL. From these serological tests, 31.25% of the dogs were positive for CVL and these were distributed in 66.7% (8/12) of the rural properties, which were positive for L. longipalpis. CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) light traps were installed in 12 properties (one per property) and insects were caught on three consecutive days per month for one year. L. longipalpis was present on 100% of the rural properties visited, at least once during the twelve-month interval, totaling 64 males and 25 females. The insects were more numerous after the peak of the rain, but the association between prevalence of peridomestic vectors and the climatic data (precipitation, relative air humidity and temperature) and the occurrences of CVL among dogs on each rural property were not statistical significant (p < 0.05). However, the occurrence of CVL cases in dogs and the presence of L. longipalpis indicate that more attention is necessairy for the control of this disease in the rural area studied.

Yoldar, E. Dincer, B. Alten, A. Ozkul;Phlebovirus and Leishmania detection in sandflies from eastern Thrace and northern Cyprus;Background: Phlebotomine sandflies are vectors of several pathogens with significant impact for public health. This study was conducted to investigate and characterize phlebovirus and Leishmania infections in vector sandflies collected in the eastern Thrace region in Tur Northern Cyprus, where previous data indicate activity of these agents. Methods: Field sampling of sandflies was performed at 4 locations in Edirne and Tekirdag provinces of eastern Thrace and at 17 locations in Lefkosa, Girne, Magosa and Guzelyurt provinces of northern Cyprus. In sandfly pools, phlebovirus RNA and Leishmania DNA were screened via a generic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and kinetoplast minicircle PCR, respectively. Selected sandfly specimens unsuitable for pathogen detection were identified to species level. Cytochrome oxidase 1 gene region was used for DNA barcoding of selected specimens and pathogen positive pools. Positive amplicons were cloned and characterized by sequencing. Results: A total of 2690 sandflies, collected from Eastern Thrace (15.4%) and Northern Cyprus (84.6%) were evaluated. Morphological examination of 780 specimens from Cyprus exhibited Phlebotomus perfiliewi sensu lato (72.6%), Phlebotomus tobbi (19.7%), Phlebotomus papatasi (2.8%), Laroussius sp. (1.6%) and Sergentomyia azizi (1.6%), Sergentomyia sp. (0.9%), Sergentomyia minuta (0.5%) and Phleobotomus jacusieli (0.1%) species. Pathogen screening was performed in 1910 specimens distributed in 195 pools. In eight pools of P.tobbi sandflies collected in Cyprus, Leishmania infantum DNA was demonstrated. Toscana virus (TOSV) genotype A sequences were identified in two pools of P. perfiliewi s.l. and one pool of P.tobbi sandflies from Cyprus. Co-infection of TOSV and Leishmania infantum was characterized in a P.tobbi pool. Sequences belonging to novel phleboviruses are revealed in three P. perfiliewi s.l. pools. One sequence, provisionally named Edirne virus, identified in Edirne province in eastern Thrace, demonstrated the highest rate of genomic similarity to Adria and Salehabad viruses. Furthermore, Girne 1 and Girne 2 viruses, identified in Girne province, revealed similarities to TOSV and Sandfly Fever Sicilian virus and related strains, respectively. Conclusions: Activity of TOSV genotype A strains in Cyprus and co-infection of sandfly vectors with L. infantum was documented for the first time. Novel phlebovirus strains of unknown medical significance was identified in sampling regions.

Prospective canine leishmaniosis survey and entomological studies conducted on the Island of Minorca, 20 years after first data were obtained;Leishmaniosis is present in the Mediterranean region of Europe, where Leishmania infantum is responsible for the disease, dogs are the main reservoir, and sand flies of the Phlebotomus genus, subgenus Larroussius, are proven vectors. Some areas, including Minorca in the Balearic Islands, are considered free of the disease, despite the presence of vectors. However, in the context of the current expansion of canine leishmaniosis in parts of Europe, an epidemiological study using a veterinary questionnaire was carried out to establish the current situation of the disease in the Balearic Islands. While 50% of veterinarians thought that the incidence of canine leishmaniosis had not changed over time, 26.2% perceived an increasing trend, mainly those from Minorca, where most of the veterinarians polled (88.1%) considered the new diagnosed cases as autochthonous. A cross-sectional serological study performed in this island gave a seroprevalence rate of 24%. Seroprevalence among animals of local origin and with no history of movements to endemic areas was 31%. The presence of autochthonous canine leishmaniosis in Minorca was not correlated with an increase in vector density. The environmental and climatic factors that influenced the distribution and density of Phlebotomus perniciosus on the island and the possible causes of the apparent emergence of canine leishmaniosis in Minorca are discussed.

Pourmehdi;Antibody detection against Leishmania infantum in sera of companion cats in Ahvaz, south west of Iran;"Leishmaniasis is an important and common zoonotic disease with a great impact on public health. In the present study, a total of 195 companion cats of different ages were examined for serum antibody detection against Leishmania infantum by immunochromatography assay. The cats were selected from those referring to Veterinary Hospital of Ahvaz University, south west of Iran from May 2009 to March 2012. Classification was made by age, sex, breed, region and season. The studied cats were divided based on age into three groups (<1 year, 1-3 years and > 3 years) and based on area into five regions (north, east, west, south and central). The results were analyzed by using Chi-square analysis, Fischer's exact test and Z test. Eighteen of 195 serum samples (9.23%) had antibody against Leishmania infantum (%95 Confidence Interval: 5.1-13.3%). Prevalence was significantly higher in adult cats above 3 years (28.57%; 14 out of 49) compared with mean-age cats 1-3 years (3.57%; 3 out of 84) (Odds Ratio: 10.8) and less than 1 year (1.61%; 1 out of 62) (OR: 24.4) (P<0.001). Prevalence was higher in male cats (9.82%; 11 out of 112) than females (8.43%; 7 out of 83), the spring season (13.04%; 6 out of 46) and north region (13.89%; 5 out of 36), but the difference was not significant between the prevalence of infection relative to host gender, season and region (P>0.05). In conclusion, it is necessary to control cat's population in these area particular adult cats to reduce risk of infection transmission to other animals and human.

Filipe;An atypical case of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum in Portugal.;Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by an intracellular protozoan that belongs to the genus Leishmania and is transmitted by a phlebotomine sandfly. In Southwest Europe, including Portugal, cutaneous leishmaniasis is considered a rare disease of unknown or underestimated prevalence. Leishmania infantum is the only species identified as responsible for the autochthonous cases.We report the case of a 66-year-old man with an erythematous, painless plaque on the mid face region, accompanied by nasal obstruction with 9 months of evolution. The initial diagnoses were: lymphoma, subcutaneous mycosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, and lupus vulgaris. The diagnosis of leishmaniasis was based on histopathology findings and identification of L. infantum by DNA based methods. Blood cultures, abdominal ultrasound and myelogram ruled out systemic involvement. The patient was treated with intravenous meglumine antimoniate (20 mg per kg/day) for four weeks, without major side effects.We emphasize the importance of this case because human cutaneous leishmaniasis has rarely been diagnosed in Portugal and some cases are atypical, such as the situation herein described.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;;;;;;;;;;;;11;Dermatology online journal;antiprotozoal agent,meglumine,meglumine antimoniate,organometallic compound,aged,article,case report,human,Leishmania infantum,male,parasitology,pathology,Portugal,skin leishmaniasis,Aged,Antiprotozoal Agents,Humans,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous,Male,Meglumine,Organometallic Compounds,Portugal;;Cited By :3,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;20407;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84905296800&partnerID=40&md5=43af73cda8c373fa3f54f62f0e4d1080;19;2013;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Bhattacharjee, P.C. Sarmah;Prevalence of haemoparasites in pet, working and stray dogs of Assam and North-East India: A hospital based study;Aim: This research work is aimed to find out the prevalence of haemoparasitic infections in different categories of dogs. Materials and Methods: Out of 2104 dogs registered in the Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex of the College of Veterinary Science, Khanapara, Guwahati during January 2009 to December 2010, blood of 424 cases suspected for haemoparasites on the basis of clinical history were microscopically examined in wet blood film and giemsa stained blood smears. Results: The prevalence was 57.31% in the hospital population comprising pet (58.03%) and working (54.54%) dogs and 63.64% in stray dog population. A total of 7 species viz. Babesia gibsoni (47.16%), Ehrlichia (Anaplasma) platys (8.49%), Dirofilaria immitis (2.83%), Ehrlichia canis (2.12%), Babesia canis (1.41%), Hepatozoon canis (1.41%) and Ehrlichia ewingii (0.47%) in single or mixed infections were recorded. B. gibsoni was found to be most predominant haemoprotozoan species. However, B. canis, the large form of Babesia was detected in very few dogs. Similarly, inclusion of E. platys inside blood platelets, although rare in occurrence, was more easily detectable than that of E. canis inside the monocytes and lymphocytes. Infection with D. immitis in pet dogs (2.38%) was comparatively lower than in working dogs (4.54%) and found in single and mixed infections with B. gibsoni, B. canis and E. platys. Hepatozoon canis was recorded in 6 hospital dogs either in single or mixed infection with B. gibsoni and E. platys. Six species of haemoparasites namely B. gibsoni (47.72%), D. immitis (27.27%), E. platys (4.54%), E. canis (2.27%), E. ewingii (2.27%) and H. canis (2.27%) were detected in blood of stray dogs. Trypanosoma evansi as recorded in dogs from other parts of the country was not detected in this study. Conclusion: Present findings led to a significant conclusion that Assam and adjoining states of North East region of India are highly enzootic for the vector borne haemoparasites of dog.

Carneiro;Canine visceral leishmaniasis: Incidence and risk factors for infection in a cohort study in Brazil;"Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil is caused by Leishmania infantum parasites and is transmitted by sand flies of the Phlebotominae family. Dogs are the main urban reservoirs and represent the major source of contagion for the vectors. Studies have shown that most infected dogs are polymerase chain reaction-positive months before seroconversion. Herein, we describe a cohort study designed to identify the incidence of and risk factors for L. infantum infection as detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. To determine the risk factors for infection, we conducted a baseline canine survey (n=1443) from which dogs were selected for the cohort study (n=282) involving three evaluations over the course of a 26-month follow-up period. Serology, molecular tests, and a structured questionnaire were used. The risk factors for infection were identified by means of the Cox regression model. The overall infection incidence was 5.8 per 100 dog-months (95% confidence interval 5.1-6.5). Increased risk of infection was associated with the presence of previous cases of canine visceral leishmaniasis in the domiciles (hazard ratio [HR] 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-1.8) and unplastered house walls (HR 3.6; 95% CI 1.6-8.1). These risk factors suggest that insecticide spraying in cracks and crevices in unplastered walls can reduce biting rates within and around homes. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the Visceral Leishmaniasis Control and Surveillance Program should adopt environmental management measures in homes with previous cases of canine visceral leishmaniasis, because these homes are more likely to maintain the transmission cycle.

Sabzevari, G.R. Razmi, A. Naghibi, J. Khoshnegah;A serological study of Leishmania infantum in dogs of Khorasan Razavi province, Iran;Leishmania infantum is the principal agent of visceral leishmaniosis (kala-azar) in all areas of Iran. The disease is endemic in Fars, Ardabil, East Azerbaijan and Bushehr provinces while it is sporadic in other parts of the country. Dog as a member of canidae family is the main animal reservoir host of kala-azar. The present study was carried out to determine the sero-prevalence of canine leishmaniosis in Mashhad, the capital city of Khorasan Razavi Province, in the north east of Iran. Two-hundred and nine dogs in two different classes including stray and sheepdogs were selected for this cross-sectional study. The blood samples were collected and tested by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test for detection of anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies. The results showed that 16/209 (7.6 %) of blood samples were positive. The sero-prevalence rates in stray and sheepdogs were 11/94 (11.7 %) and 5/115 (4.3 %), respectively (p < 0.05). Based on the results obtained, it is concluded that visceral leishmaniosis is distributed among dogs of this area, also sero-prevalence of canine leishmaniosis in stray dogs higher than sheepdogs.

To identify tick-borne pathogens among dogs from Campo Grande, MS, Brazil testing seropositive for Leishmania infantum (syn. L. chagasi), a serological and molecular study was conducted to detect Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys and Babesia vogeli in 60 serum and spleen samples. A confirmatory diagnosis of L. infantum based on serological and molecular assays was also performed, as was sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis to assess the identity of the parasite species infecting these animals. IgG antibodies to Ehrlichia spp., B. vogeli and L. infantum were found, respectively, in 39 (65%), 49 (81.6%) and 60 (100%) of the sampled dogs. Twenty-seven (45%), fifty-four (90%), fifty-three (88.3%), two (3.3%) and one (1.6%) dog were positive, respectively, for E. canis, Leishmania spp., Leishmania donovani complex, Babesia sp. and Anaplasma sp. in PCR assays. After sequencing, the amplicons showed 99% of identity with E. canis, B. vogeli, A. platys and Leishmania chagasi isolates.

Methods: Sticky papers and Sherman trap were used for collection of sand flies and rodents, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of kDNA, ITS1-rDNA were used for identification of Leishmania parasite in sand flies as well as rodents. Results: Totally 2 010 sand flies were collected and the species of Phlebotomus papatasi Scopoli was the common specimen in outdoors and indoors places. PCR technique was employed on 130 females of Phlebotomus papatasi. One of them (0.76%) was positive to parasite Leishmania major ( L. major) and one specimen (0.76%) was positive to Leishmania infantum. Microscopic investigation on blood smear of the animal reservoirs for amastigote parasites revealed 16 (44%) infected Tatera indica. Infection of them to L. major was confirmed by PCR against kDNA loci of the parasite. Conclusions: The results indicated that Phlebotomus papatasi was the dominant species circulating two species of parasites including L. major and Leishmania infantum among human and reservoirs. Furthermore, Tatera indica is the only main host reservoir for maintenance of the parasite source in the area.

Baldelli;Canine leishmaniasis surveillance program in a San Marino Republic Kennel;The Republic of San Marino is an autonomous State that, in view of its geographical and environmental features, can be considered a part of the Northern Italian territory, where the canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is endemic. In the past, a CanL focus in the Republic's kennel was described. As a consequence of this epidemiological situation, a surveillance program was carried-out covering a 6-year period (2006-2012). A total of 1,094 sera were collected from 420 kennel dogs and examined for antibodies to Leishmania infantum by the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Eighty-eight (21%) dogs resulted IFAT positive (antibody titre â‰¥1/40). The overall seroprevalence increased in the first 4 years (2006-2010), going from 5.5% to 26.8% and then decreased in the 2 following years going to 17.9% (2011) and 3.9% (2012). The cumulative incidence constantly increased from 0.6% to 2.6%. This trend could be attributed to a changed infection pressure due to the dog turnover in the kennels. According to the observed incidence values, the CanL focus seems to be stable, supported by autochthonous transmission, new case introduction and Leishmania spp. circulation in owned dogs in the same area.

Thus, the present study analyzed some of these factors in a population of dogs in a Brazilian municipality, along with the limitations of control strategies implemented there. The association between the exposure variables and occurrences of infection was analyzed through logistic regression models. The disease control interventions were treated qualitatively. Out of the 755 animals examined, 13.6% (103/755) were seropositive. Of these, 23.3% (24/103) were asymptomatic and 76.7% (79/103) presented at least one clinical sign possibly associated with visceral leishmaniasis. With weak associations, purebred, shorthaired, over 5 years of age, male and large dogs were more prone to infection. The latter two variables formed the final regression model and the association with dog size was statistically significant. The control strategies developed presented limitations and a great number of seronegative dogs was culled. The data presented contribute towards better understanding of the dynamics of infection in canine visceral leishmaniasis and indicate that actions aimed towards adequate implementation of Visceral Leishmaniasis control program in Brazilian endemic areas should be prioritized.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;;;;;596;;;;;;;4;Revista Brasileira de Parasitologia Veterinaria;Leishmania infantum,Risk factors,Serology,animal,Brazil,dog,Dog Diseases,female,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,male,parasitology,veterinary,Animals,Brazil,Dog Diseases,Dogs,Female,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Male;;Cited By :3,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;592;;;;;;;InfecÃ§Ã£o por leishmania em uma populaÃ§Ã£o de cÃ£es: Uma investigaÃ§Ã£o epidemiolÃ³gica relacionada ao controle da leishmaniose visceral;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890452026&partnerID=40&md5=7137664ec3f525cc3ef4d38c2c00ae51;22;2013;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

For a long time dogs have been implicated as the mam domestic reservoirs oi Leishmania infantum, the aetiological agent of zoonotic visceral Leishmaniasis. There are the same data about canine Leishmaniasis in other Mediterranean countries. The study investigates the level of prevalence into important areas in South Albania. Serologic methods are considered as the most efficient methods for the early diagnosis of Leishmaniasis. ELISA test is necessary to make the final serological diagnosis of most frequently parasitic diseases of dogs. The use of serological methods determinate in accurate and rapid way the diagnosis of Leishmaniasis infection. Cross-sectional investigation was done on seroprevalence of Leishmania sp. infection among apparently healthy dogs in an area where canine Leishmaniasis is endemic. Each dog was clinically examined for the presence of some discrete signs compatible with Leishmaniasis. The seroprevalence at the nonendemic area resulted 10.6%. A few of the seropositive dogs had moderately enlarged lymph nodes and some clinical signs. Trombocythopepia in animals with clinical signs can be used as a first indicator for leishmania diagnosis.

Wang;Tick-borne pathogens and disease in dogs on St. Kitts, West Indies;Between 2009 and 2011, we conducted a case-control study of ticks and tick-associated pathogens affecting dogs on the island of St. Kitts, eastern Caribbean, including 55 cases of clinically suspected tick-borne disease (TBD) and 110 presumably healthy animals presented for elective surgeries. Rhipicephalus sanguineus caused year-round infestations of dogs, and 36% of the dogs in the study were infested at the time of examination. Overall, 62% of suspected TBD cases and 24% of presumably healthy dogs tested positive by PCR for infections with: Anaplasma platys (0% and 4%), Babesia canis vogeli (20% and 6%), Babesia gibsoni (18% and 5%), Ehrlichia canis (35% and 7%), and Hepatozoon canis (5% and 2%). Co-infections were documented in 15% of these PCR-positive dogs. Antibodies against A. platys or E. canis were noted in 36% of the dogs. Thrombocytopenia was the most common sign of infection, followed by anemia. This is the first detection of A. platys, B. canis vogeli, or H. canis on St. Kitts and the first detection of B. gibsoni in the Caribbean. We conclude that tick-borne pathogens of dogs are highly prevalent in this region and may present in dogs that appear healthy, in spite of hematologic abnormalities that may increase surgical risk.

Out of 126 blood samples, 33 were positive (26%). Significantly more shepherd dogs (31%) were infected, than hunting (8%) and stray dogs (7%). Three genotypes of Hepatozoon canis were identified by sequencing, differing from each other in up to six nucleotides in the amplified portion of their 18S rRNA gene. In Dermacentor marginatus larvae/nymphs and Dermacentor reticulatus nymphs, H. canis was present only if they had been collected from PCR-positive dogs, and the genotypes were identical in the ticks and their hosts. However, two Haemaphysalis concinna nymphs removed from a PCR-negative dog were found positive for H. canis, and the genotype detected in specimens of this tick species differed from that in the blood of their respective hosts. These results indicate that canine hepatozoonosis may be highly prevalent in regions where Rhipicephalus sanguineus is considered to be non-endemic. In addition, H. canis was identified for the first time in Hungary, as well as in D. marginatus, D. reticulatus and Ha. concinna ticks. Canine hepatozoonosis was significantly more prevalent west of the Danube river (where higher densities of red fox and golden jackal populations occur), suggesting a role of wild carnivores in its epidemiology.

Yanai;Prevalence and diversity of Hepatozoon canis in naturally infected dogs in Japanese islands and peninsulas;Canine hepatozoonosis is a worldwide protozoal disease caused by Hepatozoon canis and Hepatozoon americanum and is transmitted by ixodid ticks, Rhipicephalus and Amblyomma spp., respectively. H. canis infection is widespread in Africa, Europe, South America, and Asia, including Japan. The objective of this study was to study the distribution pattern and diversity of H. canis in naturally infected dogs in nine Japanese islands and peninsulas. Therefore, 196 hunting dogs were randomly sampled during the period from March to September 2011 and the ages and sexes were identified. Direct microscopy using Giemsa-stained blood smears revealed H. canis gametocytes in the peripheral blood of 45 (23.6 %) dogs. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on EDTA-anticoagulated blood, initially with the common primer set (B18S-F and B18S-R) amplifying the 1,665-bp portion of the 18S rRNA gene, and then with the specific primer set (HepF and HepR) amplifying about 660 bp fragments of the same gene. Based on PCR, 84 (42.9 %) dogs were positive using the common primer and 81 (41.3 %) were positive using the specific primer. The current investigation indicated that all screened areas, except for Sado Island and Atsumi Peninsula, were infected. Yaku Island had the highest infection rate (84.6 % in males and 100.0 % in females), while Ishigaki Island showed the lowest infection rates (8.3 % in males and 17.7 % in females). Both sexes were infected with no significant difference. However, diversity of infection among the surveyed islands and peninsulas was significantly different (P < 0.05). Although H. canis has previously been reported in dogs in Japan, the higher infection rate described in the current study and the diversity of infection in a wide range of islands strongly encourage prospective studies dealing with the prevention and treatment of the infection in dogs, as well as control of ticks.

Marques, V.M. Veloso, M. Carneiro;Risk Factors for Seroconversion by Leishmania infantum in a Cohort of Dogs from an Endemic Area of Brazil;"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has recently emerged in various urban and peri-urban areas of Brazil and other countries. Understanding the urbanization of VL requires identification of risk factors associated with human and canine infection. To determine the predictors of risk for canine VL, a survey was conducted of 1,443 dogs, from which a cohort was selected (n = 455) and evaluated for approximately 26 months. Serology was conducted with two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA): one conducted in the Laboratory of Zoonosis of the Belo Horizonte Health Department (LZOON) and the other in the Laboratory of Immunopathology of the Federal University of Ouro Preto (LIMP). A molecular diagnostic method (PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism) and a structured questionnaire were also used. To identify the factors associated with seroconversion, two time-dependent Cox regression models were performed with different sensitivities (model 1, seroconversion by ELISA/LZOON; model 2, seroconversion by ELISA/LIMP). The overall incidences of seroconversion were 6.5/1000 dogs-months and 11.2/1000 dogs-months for ELISA/LZOON and ELISA/LIMP, respectively. Increased risk of seroconversion was associated with short fur (model 1: hazard ratio [HR] 1.9), the presence of dry leaves (model 1: HR 2.8) or manure (model 1: HR 3.5) in the backyard, dogs sleeping predominantly in the backyard (model 2: HR 2.1), the presence of symptoms (model 2: HR 2.0), and positive molecular results during follow-up (model 2: HR 1.5). Decreased risk was associated with insecticide spraying in the house (model 2: HR 0.5). These results indicate that more-vulnerable domiciles, certain dog behaviors, lack of vector control measures, and positive molecular results were associated with the occurrence of canine VL. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that PCR-positive dogs should be monitored, owing to the possibility of seroconversion. Identifying risk factors for seroconversion in dogs is crucial for developing adequate strategies for VL prevention and control.

In five VL endemic villages of Boyer-Ahmad district in 2010, fifteen infected dogs with symptoms of canine visceral leishmaniasis were found. At the first, all cases were tested by DAT for evaluation of anti leishmanial antibodies and then after necropsy, parasitological study was conducted by use of impression smear of liver and spleen. Nested PCR was use to determination of the parasite in the liver and spleen tissues. From fifteen cases, fourteen dogs had antibody titer above of 1:320 while one of the cases was seronegative. Leishmania amastigotes was seen in 13 smears of liver and spleen (13 cases). The agent of disease in 14 dogs determined as Leishmania infantum by nested PCR.

Direct xenodiagnosis of leishmaniasis proved that hares (Lepus granatensis) from this focus are able to infect with Leishmania infantum colonized Phlebotomus perniciosus. To a better understanding of this focus of leishmaniasis, we conducted an entomological survey using CDC light traps, at the end of the seasonal transmission period of 2011 before the beginning of control measures of the disease, to study the phlebotomine sand flies species involved. Detection of Leishmania DNA in the sand flies captured was studied by kDNA-PCR and cpb-PCR. In addition, blood fed and gravid female P. perniciosus were analysed by a PCR based in vertebrate cytochrome b (cyt b) gene. Taxonomic identification of captured sand flies (n = 174) as P. perniciosus (n = 171) and Sergentomyia minuta (n = 3) together with the analysis of blood feeding in ten sand flies that shows a high preference for hares (n = 6), followed by humans (n = 3), and cats (n = 1) confirm a strong association between P. perniciosus hares and humans in the focus. Moreover, 79 out of 135 (58.5 %) P. perniciosus were positive to L. infantum by PCR approaches. These data support the increase of human leishmaniasis cases in the area and the existence of an unusual sylvatic cycle alternative to the classical domestic one, where the dog is the main reservoir of L. infantum.

Alaeenovin, S. Mohammadi, N. Baghban;Occurrence of low density of Leishmania infantum in sandflies from a new focus of visceral leishmaniasis in northwest of Iran;Background & objectives: Observations and case studies have shown that the number of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) cases have increased in the recent years in several areas of Iran including Sarab district, East Azerbaijan province. Sarab district has been considered as a new focus of VL in Iran. The density of the sandfly vector and the Leishmania parasites causing infection has been assessed in 2009. Methods: Sandfly species had been collected from Sarab district, East Azerbaijan province in 2009 using sticky papers and CDC traps. DNA of sandflies was extracted and nested PCR was amplified in a region of the ribosomal RNA amplicon of Leishmania (ITS1-5.8S rRNA gene), which was shown to be species-specific by DNA sequence. Results: Altogether, 1317 male and female sandflies were trapped. At least 10 different sandfly species were identified morphologically. Leishmania infantum was the only Leishmania that was detected among the sandfly's population in Sarab district. All the infectious cases (4/223) found in the abundant sandfly region were Phlebotomus kandelakii. Conclusion: The diversity of sandflies was similar to those in the main VL focal points in Iran, but the diversity of parasite and density were significantly lower. The low prevalence of VL in Sarab district might be explained by the scarcity of infected domestic dogs Canis familiaris the primary reservoir host of VL in the region. By finding the L. infantum in P. kandelakii for the first time on this new focus, we are able to conclude that P. kandelakii might be the vector of L. infantum.

In Europe, A. platys has so far mainly been described for some Mediterranean countries. Here, we describe a case of A. platys infection in a dog from Romania, confirmed by PCR. Additionally, the dog had a co-infection with Hepatozoon canis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of A. platys infection in Romania and the first case of a co-infection with A. platys and H. canis altogether. Both pathogens should be considered as possible disease agents in dogs suffering from disease associated with tick bite in south-eastern Europe.

A total of 328 ticks, including 133 adults (55 males and 75 females consist of 63 partially engorged and 15 fully engorged) and 195 nymphs (91 partially engorged and 104 fully engorged) were detached from the dogs. Fully engorged nymphs and females were incubated at 27 C and relative humidity of 85 % to molt to adult stage and recover eggs. The ticks were pooled according to sex and developmental stage. No Hepatozoon gamonts were found, whereas, by PCR, 15.87 % (10/63) of the dogs were infected with Hepatozoon canis. Of the 68 tick pools tested, 14 (20.58 %) pools were infected with Hepatozoon spp., an overall maximum likelihood estimation of prevalence of 4.9 % (95 % confidence intervals (CI) = 2.85-7.93 %) per 100 ticks. Maximum likelihood estimation of the infection rate varied by tick sex and developmental categories, ranging from 1.75 % (95 % CI = 0.11-8.11 %) in fed males to 6.81 % (95 % CI = 2.07-17.46 %) in unfed females. One amplicon from a fed adult female was 99 % identical to the sequence for Hepatozoon felis. The remaining sequences isolated from both dogs and ticks shared 99-100 % similarity with the corresponding H. canis isolates. This is the first detection of H. canis and H. felis in the tick R. sanguineus in Turkey.

Reports of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Northwest areas are rare, and its etiological agents are unknown. In the current study, we report six CL and two post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) cases caused by Leishmania infantum from endemic areas of VL in the Northwest. Smears were made from skin lesions of 30 suspected patients in 2002-2011, and CL was determined by microscopy or culture. Leishmania spp. were identified by nested-PCR assay. The disease was confirmed in 20 out of 30 (66%) suspected patients by parasitological examinations. L. infantum was identified in eight and Leishmania major in 12 CL cases by nested-PCR. Cutaneous leishmaniasis patients infected with L. major had the history of travel to CL endemic areas. L. infantum antibodies were detected by direct agglutination test (DAT) at titers of 1:3200 in two cases with history of VL. Results of this study indicated that L. infantum is a causative agent of CL as well as PKDL in the VL endemic areas. Â© W. S.

In the present study, phlebotomine and canine surveys were conducted to identify sandfly blood meal sources and to update the occurrence of Leishmania infection in vectors and dogs. Four sandfly species were captured: Phlebotomus perniciosus, Phlebotomus ariasi, Phlebotomus sergenti and Sergentomyia minuta. In one P. perniciosus female, L. infantum DNA was detected. Blood meal tests showed that this species had no host preferences and was an opportunistic feeder. An overall canine leishmaniasis (CanL) seroprevalence of 16.06% was found; the seroprevalence was 3.88% in dogs housed in kennels and 40.63% in dogs that attended veterinary clinics. The simultaneous occurrence of dogs and P. perniciosus infected with L. infantum in the AR indicates that the region continues to be an endemic area for CanL. Our results reinforce the need for the systematic spatial distribution of phlebotomine populations and their Leishmania infection rates and the need to simultaneously perform pathogen monitoring in both invertebrate and vertebrate hosts to investigate the transmission, distribution and spreading of Leishmania infection.";;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;10.1590/0074-0276108042013014;;;;487;;;;;;;4;Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz;Blood meal preferences,Dog,Leishmania infantum,Phlebotomine sandflies,Portugal,Vectors,animal,animal disease,article,classification,disease carrier,disease transmission,dog,dog disease,feeding behavior,female,isolation and purification,Leishmania infantum,parasitology,physiology,Portugal,Psychodidae,visceral leishmaniasis,Animals,Dog Diseases,Dogs,Feeding Behavior,Female,Insect Vectors,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Portugal,Psychodidae,Canis familiaris,Invertebrata,Leishmania infantum,Phlebotominae,Phlebotomus ariasi,Phlebotomus perniciosus,Phlebotomus sergenti,Psychodidae,Sergentomyia,Sergentomyia minuta,Vertebrata;;Cited By :16,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;481;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878748659&doi=10.1590%2f0074-0276108042013014&partnerID=40&md5=b511e3c55c66cefb5e496c7a72399b1c;108;2013;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

We conducted a prospective observational study of all human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected immigrants who visited the Infectious Diseases Department of the Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain, during June 2010-May 2011. Screening of the most prevalent tropical diseases (intestinal parasitosis, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, malaria, schistosomiasis, and strongyloidiasis) was performed according to geographic origin. A total of 190 patients were included: 141 (74.2%) from atin America, 41 (21.6%) from sub-Saharan Africa, and 8 (4.2%) from northern Africa. Overall, 36.8% (70 of 190) of the patients had at least one positive result for any parasitic disease: 5 patients with positive Trypanosoma cruzi serology, 11 patients with positive Schistosoma mansoni serology, 35 patients with positive Strongyloides stercoralis serology, 7 patients with positive Leishmania infantum serology, intestinal parasitosis were detected in 37 patients, malaria was diagnosed in one symptomatic patient.

To detect and identify the Leishmania parasites and their corresponding vector(s), an investigation was carried out in Azarshahr County, a new and important focus of the disease in East Azerbaijan province in northwestern Iran during late April to late October 2010. Methods: Sandflies were sampled using sticky papers (A4 white paper soaked in castor oil) from inside and outside of the houses and animal shelters, close to the vegetation and crevices. The head and three last abdomen segments of the specimens were removed and mounted in Puri's medium for species identification. The rest of body was subjected to molecular methods for detection of leishmanial parasites. Results: Among 400 female sandflies tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of kDNA, ITS1-rDNA, and CPB genes of the parasite followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), only 2 out of 8 Phlebotomus tobbi were positive to L. infantum parasites.

Sainz;Seropositivity rates for agents of canine vector-borne diseases in Spain: A multicentre study;"Background: Controlling canine vector-borne diseases (CVBD) is a major concern, since some of these diseases are serious zoonoses. This study was designed to determine seropositivity rates in Spain for agents causing the following five CVBD: leishmaniosis (Leishmania infantum: Li), heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis: Di), ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia canis: Ec), anaplasmosis (Anaplasma phagocytophilum/Anaplasma platys: An) and Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi: Bb). Methods. Anti-An, -Bb, and -Ec antibodies and the Di antigen were determined using the 4DX SNAPÂ® Test (IDEXX Laboratories) and anti-L. infantum (Li) antibodies using the Leishmania SNAPÂ® Test (IDEXX Laboratories) in blood and/or serum samples. Results: Among 1100 dogs examined, overall seropositivity rates were: Li (15.7%), Ec (5%), An (3.1%), Di (1.25%) and Bb (0.4%). While seropositivity towards Bb and Di was similar in all geographic regions, rates were significantly higher in the east of Spain (8.3%) for An, significantly higher in the north (20%) for Ec, and significantly higher in the Southeast (46.6%) and South (27.4%), and significantly lower in the north (0%) for Li.No statistical associations were observed between sex and the CVBD analyzed (p â‰¥ 0.05) while the following associations with other variables were detected: a higher seropositivity to Ec (40%) and Bb (6.7%) in dogs under one year of age compared with adults (p < 0.05); and a higher seropositivity to An and Li in dogs that lived outdoors versus indoors (p = 0.01; p < 0.001, respectively). Seropositivity rates of 2.1%, 0%, 1.7%, 0.5% and 4.2% were recorded respectively for An, Bb, Ec, Di and Li in dogs with no clinical signs (n = 556) versus 3.8%, 0.6%, 7.5%, 1.8% and 25.9% for those with signs (n = 507) suggestive of a CVBD. Conclusion: The data obtained indicate a risk for dogs in Spain of acquiring any of the five CVBD examined. Veterinarians in the different regions should include these diseases in their differential diagnoses and recommend the use of repellents and other prophylactic measures to prevent disease transmission by arthropod vectors. Public health authorities also need to become more involved in the problem, since some of the CVBD examined here also affect humans.

Nonetheless, information on FVBD agents and their prevalence in Portugal is scarce. Methods. Three-hundred and twenty domestic cats presented to 30 veterinary medical centres in the north and centre regions of Portugal were randomly sampled. Blood was assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for genera Anaplasma/Ehrlichia, genus Babesia, Hepatozoon canis, Hepatozoon felis, Leishmania infantum and the genus Rickettsia. Babesia-positive samples were further tested for Babesia canis and Babesia vogeli. Results: Eighty (25.0%) out of the 320 cats were positive to at least one vector-borne agent, including seven (2.2%) cats co-infected with two agents. Two cats (0.6%) were infected with Anaplasma/Ehrlichia spp., four (1.3%) with B. canis, 26 (8.1%) with B. vogeli, 50 (15.6%) with H. felis, one (0.3%) with L. infantum and four (1.3%) with Rickettsia spp. No cat tested positive for H. canis. One cat (0.3%) was co-infected with B. canis and B. vogeli, three (0.9%) with B. vogeli and H. felis, one (0.3%) with H. felis and L. infantum, and two (0.6%) with H. felis and Rickettsia spp. Conclusions: A considerable prevalence of infection with vector-borne pathogens among the domestic feline population of the north and centre of Portugal has been revealed by the present study. Additionally, this is the first detection of B. vogeli in cats from Europe and of H. felis in cats from Portugal.

The aim of this study was to carry out a survey on domestic feline hepatozoonosis and characterize it morphologically and genetically. Methods. Hepatozoon sp. DNA was amplified by PCR from the blood of 55 of 152 (36%) surveyed cats in Israel and from all blood samples of an additional 19 cats detected as parasitemic by microscopy during routine hematologic examinations. Hepatozoon sp. forms were also characterized from tissues of naturally infected cats. Results: DNA sequencing determined that all cats were infected with Hepatozoon felis except for two infected by Hepatozoon canis. A significant association (p = 0.00001) was found between outdoor access and H. felis infection. H. felis meronts containing merozoites were characterized morphologically from skeletal muscles, myocardium and lungs of H. felis PCR-positive cat tissues and development from early to mature meront was described. Distinctly-shaped gamonts were observed and measured from the blood of these H. felis infected cats. Two fetuses from H. felis PCR-positive queens were positive by PCR from fetal tissue including the lung and amniotic fluid, suggesting possible transplacental transmission. Genetic analysis indicated that H. felis DNA sequences from Israeli cats clustered together with the H. felis Spain 1 and Spain 2 sequences. These cat H. felis sequences clustered separately from the feline H. canis sequences, which grouped with Israeli and foreign dog H. canis sequences. H. felis clustered distinctly from Hepatozoon spp. of other mammals. Feline hepatozoonosis caused by H. felis is mostly sub-clinical as a high proportion of the population is infected with no apparent overt clinical manifestations. Conclusions: This study aimed to integrate new histopathologic, hematologic, clinical, epidemiological and genetic findings on feline hepatozoonosis and promote the understanding of this infection. The results indicate that feline infection is primarily caused by a morphologically and genetically distinct species, H. felis, which has predilection to infecting muscular tissues, and is highly prevalent in the cat population studied. The lack of previous comprehensively integrated data merits the redescription of this parasite elucidating its parasitological characteristics.

Roura;Wolbachia, filariae and Leishmania coinfection in dogs from a Mediterranean area;Objectives: In an endemic area for leishmaniosis and filariasis, coinfection can occur and the immunomodulation triggered by Wolbachia infection might influence the clinical signs and progression of both diseases. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of Wolbachia in dogs infected with Dirofilaria immitis and other filarial nematodes, to evaluate the prevalence of coinfection of Leishmania infantum, filariae and Wolbachia and their association with clinical presentation. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction assays were performed to detect filarial species, Wolbachia species and Leishmania in 118 samples of dogs from southeastern Spain with leishmaniosis and/or filariasis. Results: Ninety-eight dogs were infected with Leishmania and 49 had filarial infection (29 were coinfected with both). Wolbachia DNA was detected in 30Â·6% of filariae-positive dogs (15/49). Dogs coinfected with Leishmania and filaria had more severe clinical signs. Wolbachia infection was significantly (P=0Â·026) more frequent in dogs that were not infected with Leishmania. There was no correlation between outcome and coinfection with these pathogens. Clinical Significance: This study highlights the increased sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction in the diagnosis of filariasis, confirms the presence of Wolbachia in dogs from the Mediterranean basin, shows the increased severity of clinical signs when Leishmania-filarial coinfection is present and suggests a protective role of Wolbachia in leishmaniosis.

Hatam, M. Kalantari, Y. Daneshbod;Molecular, cytological, and immunocytochemical study and kDNA sequencing of laryngeal Leishmania infantum infection;Mucosal leishmaniasis is a well-known clinical manifestation of infections mainly caused by New World Leishmania species, especially Leishmania braziliensis (Viannia) in Central and South America. It is extremely uncommon in the world, even in the endemic areas such as Fars Province, Southern Iran. Two male immunocompetent subjects who developed Leishmania mucosal lesion mimicking a laryngeal tumor presented with a several-months history of dysphonia, dyspnea, hoarseness, and odynophagia. Multiple smears from the lesions showed structures resembling the amastigote form of Leishmania. Nested PCR analysis to amplifying a fragment of Leishmania infantum kinetoplastid DNA from the Giemsa-stained smear resulted in a fragment of 680 bp. Sequence analysis of one of the strains showed 98 % similarity to L. infantum strain IranJWinf (GenBank accession no. AB678348.1) and 96 % similarity to L. infantum isolate MCAN/ES/98/10445 (GenBank accession no. EU437407.1), while another strain showed 97 % similarity with two L. infantum strains from kala-azar patient (GenBank accession nos. AJ223725.1 and AF027577.1). Immunocytochemical staining with anti-L. infantum mAb (D2) was positive. Primary mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) may occur in the immunocompetent patients who reside in or travel to endemic areas of leishmaniasis. Mucosal leishmaniasis contracted in endemic areas, such as Iran, has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of lesions in the other mucosa and may occur in previously healthy persons. Therefore, cytology, PCR, and immunocytochemistry- based methods with anti-Leishmania mAb are helpful in the diagnosis of ML.

Following the report of two cases of CVL, the Control Center of Zoonotic Diseases conducteda serological survey by ELISA and IFAT assays in seven districts of the Santa Catarina Island. Eleven seropositive dogs of autochthonous transmission were used in the present study. Infection by Leishmania sp. was confirmed by parasitological examination of bone marrow, liver, spleen and lymph nodes, culture in Schneider's medium and PCR. Leishmania sp. isolates were characterized by PCR-RFLP and hybridization with specific probes, allowing for the identification of Leish-mania infantum. Autochthonous transmission of this disease in an area with high tourist traffic presents a major public health concern and signifies the emergence of an important zoonosis in southern Brazil. Therefore, the implementation of surveillance and control measures is imperative to prevent the spread of the disease among the canine population as well as transmission to the human population.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;10.1590/S0100-736X2013000400013;;;;496;;;;;;;4;Pesquisa Veterinaria Brasileira;Canine visceral leishmaniasis,Leishmania infantum,Neglected diseases,Public health,Zoonosis,Canis familiaris,Leishmania infantum,Leishmania sp.;;Cited By :5,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;490;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84878639809&doi=10.1590%2fS0100-736X2013000400013&partnerID=40&md5=7960b177349a01009473467e61271814;33;2013;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

These two infections, typically reported from tropical and sub-tropical regions, have not been previously reported in dogs from Argentina. A total of 86 blood samples from dogs with suspected rickettsial disease and 28 non-suspected dogs were studied. Analysis included evaluation of hematological findings, PCR for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species and sequencing of the positive PCR products. E. canis was detected in the blood of six dogs and A. platys in eighteen. All the dogs categorized as non-suspected were negative by PCR. Co-infection with Hepatozoon canis and Babesia vogeli was documented. This first report of E. canis and A. platys infections in dogs from Argentina indicates that these tick-borne infections have a considerably broader range than previously recognized in South America.

Three main foci were identified in eighty's decade: TrÃ¡s-os-Montes and Alto Douro region, Lisbon region and Algarve region, but according to OnLeish observatory data, canine leishmaniasis cases have been reported from several other regions, for which sand fly species and their infection rates are unknown. This study is the first phlebotomine survey in Torres Novas municipality, SantarÃ©m District, Portugal. The main objectives were to identify the phlebotomine species, their bioecological aspects, Leishmania infection rate and the risk factors for the presence of phlebotomine species in the municipality. From June to November, 2010, 275 biotopes were surveyed with CDC light-traps. Captures covered the 17 parishes of the municipality and included domestic, peridomestic and sylvatic biotopes. Specimens were identified morphologically and females were used for molecular detection of Leishmania and bloodmeal identification. Simple and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to identify risk factors for phlebotomine presence. Nonparametric tests were used to compare densities of independent groups. A total of 1262 sand flies were captured and identified, and four species detected: P. perniciosus (73.69%), P. ariasi (8.16%), P. sergenti (6.58%) and Sergentomyia minuta (11.57%). In 71.4% localities at least one L. infantum proven vector species was present. Risk factors were identified as: high average temperatures and low relative humidities, sheltered locations and absence of strong wind, presence of pine trees as dominant vegetation, peridomestic biotopes, particularly sheep pens or proximity of sheep, poultry and house martin nests. L. infantum infection rate was 4% for P. ariasi and 0.48% for the total of Larroussius females. P. perniciosus females exhibited an opportunistic behavior, feeding in a wide variety of vertebrate hosts. The high abundance and distribution of proven vector species, together with a canine leishmaniasis seroprevalence of 7.93% in the District, and the capture of a gravid infective sand fly female, suggests that Torres Novas municipality is a potential zoonotic leishmaniasis focus in the country.

A reverse line blot (RLB) assay was designed to improve the simultaneous detection of all named canine piroplasm species combined with other vector-borne pathogens of dogs including Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis and Leishmania infantum common in the Mediterranean basin. Blood samples of 110 dogs from Spain (n= 21), Portugal (n= 14) and Israel (n= 75) were analyzed. The study evaluated 2 groups of dogs, 49 dogs with piroplasm infection detected by blood smear microscopy from Portugal, Spain and Israel, and 61 dogs surveyed from rural areas in Israel, for which infection status with vector-borne pathogens was unknown. Among the dogs previously diagnosed with piroplasmosis, infection with Babesia canis, Babesia vogeli, Babesia gibsoni and Theileria annae was detected in the Iberian dogs while only B vogeli was found in Israeli dogs. These differences are attributed to the absence of tick vectors for some piroplasm species such as Dermacentor reticulatus in Israel. Eleven (79%) of the Babesia-positive dogs from Portugal were co-infected with other pathogens including L infantum, H canis and E canis. Eight of 61 (13%) rural Israeli dogs were co-infected with two or more pathogens including B vogeli, L infantum, E canis, and H canis. Triple infections were demonstrated in 2 dogs. The RLB detection limit for Babesia was 50-fold lower than that of PCR. This study presents a RLB to simultaneously detect and separate the major vector-borne dog pathogens in southern Europe and the Middle East.

Baneth;Identification of Babesia species infecting dogs using reverse line blot hybridization for six canine piroplasms, and evaluation of co-infection by other vector-borne pathogens;Canine infection by vector-borne hemoparasites is frequent in tropical and sub-tropical areas where exposure to hematophageous ectoparasites is intensive. A reverse line blot (RLB) assay was designed to improve the simultaneous detection of all named canine piroplasm species combined with other vector-borne pathogens of dogs including Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis and Leishmania infantum common in the Mediterranean basin. Blood samples of 110 dogs from Spain (n= 21), Portugal (n= 14) and Israel (n= 75) were analyzed. The study evaluated 2 groups of dogs, 49 dogs with piroplasm infection detected by blood smear microscopy from Portugal, Spain and Israel, and 61 dogs surveyed from rural areas in Israel, for which infection status with vector-borne pathogens was unknown. Among the dogs previously diagnosed with piroplasmosis, infection with Babesia canis, Babesia vogeli, Babesia gibsoni and Theileria annae was detected in the Iberian dogs while only B vogeli was found in Israeli dogs. These differences are attributed to the absence of tick vectors for some piroplasm species such as Dermacentor reticulatus in Israel. Eleven (79%) of the Babesia-positive dogs from Portugal were co-infected with other pathogens including L infantum, H canis and E canis. Eight of 61 (13%) rural Israeli dogs were co-infected with two or more pathogens including B vogeli, L infantum, E canis, and H canis. Triple infections were demonstrated in 2 dogs. The RLB detection limit for Babesia was 50-fold lower than that of PCR. This study presents a RLB to simultaneously detect and separate the major vector-borne dog pathogens in southern Europe and the Middle East.

Wang;Ehrlichiosis, Babesiosis, Anaplasmosis and Hepatozoonosis in Dogs from St. Kitts, West Indies;"Background: Although tick-borne diseases are important causes of morbidity and mortality in dogs in tropical areas, there is little information on the agents causing these infections in the Caribbean. Methodology: We used PCRs to test blood from a cross-section of dogs on St Kitts for Ehrlichia (E.) canis, Babesia (B.) spp., Anaplasma (A.) spp. and Hepatozoon (H.) spp. Antibodies against E. canis and A. phagocytophilum/platys were detected using commercial immunochromatography tests. Records of the dogs were examined retrospectively to obtain clinical and laboratory data. Principal findings: There was serological and/or PCR evidence of infections of dogs with E. canis (27%; 46/170), Babesia spp. (24%; 90/372) including B. canis vogeli (12%; 43/372) and B. gibsoni (10%; 36/372), A. platys (11%; 17/157) and H. canis (6%; 15/266). We could not identify the Babesia sp. detected in nine dogs. There was evidence of multiple infections with dual infections with E. canis and B. canis vogeli (8%; 14/179) or B. gibsoni (7%; 11/170) being the most common. There was agreement between immunochromatography and PCR test results for E. canis for 87% of dogs. Only 13% of exposed dogs had signs of a tick-borne disease and 38% had laboratory abnormalities. All 10 dogs presenting for a recheck after treatment of E. canis with doxycycline were apparently healthy although all remained seropositive and six still had laboratory abnormalities despite an average of two treatments with the most recent being around 12 months previously. Infections with Babesia spp. were also mainly subclinical with only 6% (4/67) showing clinical signs and 13% (9/67) having laboratory abnormalities. Similarly, animals with evidence of infections with A. platys and H. canis were largely apparently healthy with only occasional laboratory abnormalities. Conclusions: Dogs are commonly infected with tick-borne pathogens in the Caribbean with most having no clinical signs or laboratory abnormalities.

However, there has been much speculation on the role of other arthropods in the transmission of VL. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the presence of L. infantum in cats, dogs and their ectoparasites in a VL-endemic area in northeastern Brazil. DNA was extracted from blood samples and ectoparasites, tested by conventional PCR (cPCR) and quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) targeting the L. infantum kinetoplast DNA. A total of 280 blood samples (from five cats and 275 dogs) and 117 ectoparasites from dogs were collected. Animals were apparently healthy and not previously tested by serological or molecular diagnostic methods. Overall, 213 (76.1 %) animals and 51 (43.6 %) ectoparasites were positive to L. infantum, with mean parasite loads of 795.2, 31.9 and 9.1 fg in dogs, cats and ectoparasites, respectively. Concerning the positivity between dogs and their ectoparasites, 32 (15.3 %) positive dogs were parasitized by positive ectoparasites. The overall concordance between the PCR protocols used was 59.2 %, with qPCR being more efficient than cPCR; 34.1 % of all positive samples were exclusively positive by qPCR. The high number of positive animals and ectoparasites also indicates that they could serve as sentinels or indicators of the circulation of L. infantum in risk areas.";;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:44;10.1007/s10493-012-9611-4;;;;481;;;;;;;4;Experimental & applied acarology;animal,article,Brazil,cat,Ctenocephalides,disease transmission,dog,isolation and purification,Leishmania infantum,louse,parasitology,real time polymerase chain reaction,Rhipicephalus sanguineus,visceral leishmaniasis,Animals,Brazil,Cats,Ctenocephalides,Dogs,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Phthiraptera,Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction,Rhipicephalus sanguineus;;Cited By :10,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;473;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027954854&doi=10.1007%2fs10493-012-9611-4&partnerID=40&md5=dec1f04ef4e9cf59068132bce0e705d9;59;2013;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

The aim of this study was to use molecular techniques to detect and characterize vector borne pathogens in dogs and ticks from Nigeria. Methodology/Principal Findings: Blood samples and ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus turanicus and Heamaphysalis leachi) collected from 181 dogs from Nigeria were molecularly screened for human and animal vector-borne pathogens by PCR and sequencing. DNA of Hepatozoon canis (41.4%), Ehrlichia canis (12.7%), Rickettsia spp. (8.8%), Babesia rossi (6.6%), Anaplasma platys (6.6%), Babesia vogeli (0.6%) and Theileria sp. (0.6%) was detected in the blood samples. DNA of E. canis (23.7%), H. canis (21.1%), Rickettsia spp. (10.5%), Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis (5.3%) and A. platys (1.9%) was detected in 258 ticks collected from 42 of the 181 dogs. Co- infections with two pathogens were present in 37% of the dogs examined and one dog was co-infected with 3 pathogens. DNA of Rickettsia conorii israelensis was detected in one dog and Rhipicephalus sanguineus tick. DNA of another human pathogen, Candidatus N. mikurensis was detected in Rhipicephalus sanguineus and Heamaphysalis leachi ticks, and is the first description of Candidatus N. mikurensis in Africa. The Theileria sp. DNA detected in a local dog in this study had 98% sequence identity to Theileria ovis from sheep. Conclusions/Significance: The results of this study indicate that human and animal pathogens are abundant in dogs and their ticks in Nigeria and portray the potential high risk of human exposure to infection with these agents.

This work describes the results obtained from a questionnaire sent to veterinarians throughout the province of Lleida. The majority of veterinarians (25/32, 78.1%) believed CanL cases were increasing and that the dogs had been infected locally (30/32, 93.8%). Also, a cross-sectional study was performed on the seroprevalence of CanL in kennel dogs, with and without compatible clinical signs, in the county of Pallars SobirÃ  (Pyrenees of Lleida), where an autochthonous case of CanL had been previously detected. Four serological tests were used (IFAT, ELISA, Western blot, ICF) and dogs that tested positive with at least two immunological methods were considered seropositive and probably infected. 33.1% (48/145) of the dogs were seropositive. The results of a mixed logistic regression model showed that the risk of seropositivity increased with age (OR = 1.35, p-value = 0.002), among dogs living in the southern part of Pallars SobirÃ  (OR = 6.20, p-value = 0.025) and among dogs whose owners considered their animals to be at risk of leishmaniasis infection (OR = 1.26, p-value = 0.024) and who were unaware of anti-sand fly preventive methods (OR = 11.6, p-value = 0.009). The risk decreased when dogs lived in an urban-periurban habitat (OR = 0.17, p-value = 0.002). The information gathered in the veterinary questionnaires helped us to define the knowledge, perception and awareness of the disease in a naÃ¯ve region, supporting the hypothesis of an existing CanL focus in Pallars SobirÃ , which was confirmed by the seroepidemiological survey. The seroprevalence study carried out on kennel dogs of local origin proved useful for detecting an autochthonous focus of leishmaniasis through the analysis of a small number of animals.

We conducted an explorative cross-sectional serological study, using a commercial ELISA, in 1048 healthy Austrian individuals to assess the distribution of specific antibodies against Leishmania spp. in humans in Austria. Overall, 47 individuals (4.5%) tested positive, and an additional 32 (3.1%) showed borderline results. After 12months, sera from 42 of the 79 individuals who had initially tested seropositive/borderline were tested by ELISA a second time: 18 were persistently positive, nine were borderline. Those whose sera were persistently positive/borderline were then screened for potential carrier status using a commercial oligochromatographic PCR test to detect parasite DNA. Four samples were PCR positive and were subjected to a second PCR allowing parasite identification after DNA sequencing: two samples were identified as Leishmania donovani/infantum complex and Leishmania (Viannia) guyanensis, respectively. Epidemiological information was obtained with a questionnaire: no correlation was found for the number of holiday trips within the previous 6months, but a significant risk of exposure to Leishmania spp. was found for travel to the New World, particularly to the Caribbean. Our data demonstrate that Leishmania spp. seroprevalence in non-endemic countries has been considerably underestimated. Â© 2012 The Authors.

This study provides the first report regarding molecular confirmation and ancestral relationship analysis of blood smears positive cases of assorted haemopathogens in Punjab province of India. On blood smear examination, haemopathogens were observed in 124 out of 778 (15.95%, 95% CI: 13.53-18.68) blood smears. Further polymerase chain reactions (PCR) was used on bloods smear positive cases to validate the results. Out of 778 blood samples, Babesia gibsoni was most common parasite infecting dogs (15.04%, 95% CI: 12.7-17.72), followed by Ehrlichia canis (0.39%, 95% CI: 0.0-1.13), infection of Babesia vogeli and Hepatozoon canis was same (0.26%, 95% CI: 0.0-0.9).

During the last decades no cases were notified from northern Cyprus, but herein three cases of VL (female: 2, male: 1, median age: 24.6 months) diagnosed during their hospital admission between January 2011 and December 2012 are reported. Diagnosis was based on clinical findings; 1 ? 1/64 titer positivity of immunofluorescence antibodies, Leishmania amastigotes in Giemsa-stained slides of bone marrow, as well as molecular identification confirmed that in all three the infecting pathogen was Leishmania infantum. Fever, splenomegaly, and hepatomegaly were the typical clinical findings. First-line treatment with liposomal amphotericin B (AmBisome; intravenous, 3 mg/kg) on days 1-5, followed by the same on days 10 and 21 yielded a successful outcome with no relapse in all cases. These confirmed VL cases found within 2 years demonstrate the presence of VL on the island.

We report the first case of L. infantum infection in southern Israel, presented atypically as CL in an immunosuppressed 47-year old male. The patient was treated with liposomal amphotericin-B and recovered, without extra-cutaneous complications. Diagnosis of L. infantum CL was confirmed by microscopic identification of amastigotes in Gimsa-stained smear of skin lesion, positive blood serology and a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the internal transcribed spacer 1 genes (ITS1) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS1 PCR-RFLP). We also review the medical literature on old-world CL caused by L. infantum. Multiple L. donovani/infantum CL cases were identified in the literature search. These can be divided schematically to two: 1) In several endemic countries, L. infantum strains are the main causative agents of CL; 2) In other regions, CL is almost exclusively caused by L. major or L. tropica, while L. donovani strains CL cases were reported sporadically or as imported disease.

Frontera;Detection of Leishmania DNA and blood meal sources in phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae) in western of Spain: Update on distribution and risk factors associated;Leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum is present in Mediterranean countries, with high prevalence in areas of the center and south of Spain. However, in some regions such as Extremadura (in southwest of Spain), data has not been updated since 1997. The aim of this work was (i) to provide information about the distribution of phlebotomine sand fly species in western of Spain (Extremadura region), (ii) to determine risk factors for the presence of sand fly vectors and (iii) to detect Leishmania DNA and identify blood meal sources in wild caught females. During 2012â€“2013, sand flies were surveyed using CDC miniature light-traps in 13 of 20 counties in Extremadura. Specimens were identified morphologically and females were used for molecular detection of Leishmania DNA by kDNA, ITS-1 and cyt-B. In addition, blood meals origins were analyzed by a PCR based in vertebrate cyt b gene. A total of 1083 sand flies of both gender were captured and identified. Five species were collected, Phlebotomus perniciosus (60.76%), Sergentomyia minuta (29.92%), P. ariasi (7.11%), P. papatasi (1.48%) and P. sergenti (0.74%). The last three species constitute the first report in Badajoz, the most southern province of Extremadura region. Leishmania DNA was detected in three out of 435 females (one P. pernicious and two S. minuta). Characterization of obtained DNA sequences by phylogenetic analyses revealed close relatedness with Leishmania tarentolae in S. minuta and L. infantum in P. perniciosus. Haematic preferences showed a wide range of hosts, namely: swine, humans, sheep, chickens, horses, donkeys and turkeys. The simultaneous presence of P. perniciosus and P. ariasi vectors, the analysis of blood meals, together with the detection of L. infantum and in S. minuta of L. tarentolae, confirms the ideal conditions for the transmission of this parasitosis in the western of Spain. These results improve the epidemiological knowledge of leishmaniosis and its vectors in this part of Spain, highlighting the need for ongoing entomological and parasitological surveillance.

Velo, X. de Lamballerie, M. Kota, P. Kadriaj, Y. Ozbel, R.N. Charrel, S. Bino;Detection of Leishmania infantum and a Novel Phlebovirus (Balkan Virus) from Sand Flies in Albania;"RESULTS: A total of 972 sand flies (568 females, 404 males) were aliquoted to 55 pools. Three pools (in two different regions) were positive for Leishmania infantum. Two pools (Kruje region) were positive for phlebovirus RNA and a 575-nucleotide (nt) colinearized sequence of a novel virus most closely related to but clearly distinct from Tehran virus (16% and 3% divergence at nt and amino acid levels). Next generation sequencing analysis indicated that this virus might be transmitted by either Phlebotomus neglectus, Phlebotomus tobbi, or both vectors. CONCLUSIONS: Visceral leishmaniasis has been clinically recognized in Albania for at least 80 years; however, this is the first time that L. infantum, detected by molecular means, has been reported in sand flies in Albania. At the outset of this study, only Adria virus (Salehabad species) was recognized in Albania. A novel virus, Balkan virus, was identified and genetic analysis revealed that it belongs to the Sandfly fever Naples virus group containing human pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To organize entomological campaigns to trap sand flies in selected regions of Albania and to test them for the presence of existing or new phleboviruses and for leishmania DNA. METHODS: Sand flies were collected in 14 locations from May to October 2014 using three different types of traps. Pools with a maximum of 30 individuals were prepared according to gender, trapping site, and trapping date; they were tested for the presence of (1) phlebovirus RNA with three different PCR systems (2) and Leishmania DNA using two different real-time PCR assays.";;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;;;;;806;;;;;;;12;Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.);arbovirus,Bunyaviridae,phlebotomus,Toscana virus,protozoal DNA,virus RNA,Albania,animal,female,genetics,isolation and purification,Leishmania infantum,male,parasitology,Phlebovirus,phylogeny,Psychodidae,virology,Albania,Animals,DNA, Protozoan,Female,Leishmania infantum,Male,Phlebovirus,Phylogeny,Psychodidae,RNA, Viral;;Cited By :3,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;802;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019847416&partnerID=40&md5=dd2d1893df468480d7f9d57340c0d8a9;16;2016;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

However, further knowledge about epidemiological aspects of this disease is needed in several provinces to plan control and preventive strategies to tackle the disease. The present study aims to determine the epidemiological aspect of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Taza Province from 2007-2014 and to identify the circulating species in this province. Results: The temporal study from 2007 to 2014 showed that the number of cutaneous leishmaniasis cases increased since 2010. During the period of study, most leishmaniasis cases were detected in both urban and rural areas with 34% of cases detected in two urban localities, Bab Zitouna and Bab tÃ©tÃ© with 297 and 106 cases, respectively. The molecular study of cutaneous leishmaniasis showed the presence of non-sporadic Leishmania infantum and Leishmania tropica in this province. Regarding visceral leishmaniasis, Leishmania infantum is the species that has been identified. Conclusions: The epidemio-molecular study of leishmaniasis in Taza Province showed the coexistence of two species of Leishmania in the same foci. They also indicated that CL due to Leishmania infantum is more prevalent than reported in the literature. These results will be helpful for the implementation of control strategies by targeting dogs that constitute a reservoir of Leishmania infantum.

A serological and molecular investigation of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) was performed in the municipality of Alfenas, located in the southern region of Minas Gerais, where the disease is not endemic. Samples from 87 dogs were submitted to serological tests including the Dual Path Platform (DPP (r) ) CVL Bio-Manguinhos rapid test, an in-house enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), as well as molecular techniques such as a conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the RV1/RV2 primers and a quantitative PCR (qPCR) with the LinJ31, Ldon and DNApol primers. Of the 87 serum samples, eight (9.2%) were positive for Leishmania using the DPP rapid test, but only four (4.6%) were confirmed by ELISA and two (2.3%) by IFAT. In these two serologically confirmed cases, spleen and liver samples were positive by all the employed molecular and parasitological procedures performed on spleen samples. When whole blood samples were used in the molecular assays, two samples (2.3%) were positive only by qPCR. DNA extracted and amplified from the spleens of seropositive dogs was sequenced, showing 100% of similarity with the Leishmania infantum (syn L. chagasi) sequence. Thus, the first cases of CVL have been confirmed in the Alfenas region, suggesting the importance of canine surveys in non-endemic municipalities for CVL to monitor disease progression and to prevent outbreaks.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;10.1590/S1678-9946201658075;;;;;;;;;;;;Revista do Instituto de Medicina Tropical de Sao Paulo;protozoon antibody,animal,blood,Brazil,dog,Dog Diseases,enzyme linked immunosorbent assay,fluorescent antibody technique,genetics,immunology,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,real time polymerase chain reaction,veterinary,Animals,Antibodies, Protozoan,Brazil,Dog Diseases,Dogs,Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,Fluorescent Antibody Technique,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction;;Cited By :2,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;75;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85014810090&doi=10.1590%2fS1678-9946201658075&partnerID=40&md5=62205ac2428f4f97542fe61ca1c95f71;58;2016;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

BaÃ±uls;Transmission of Leishmania infantum in the Canine Leishmaniasis Focus of Mont-Rolland, Senegal: Ecological, Parasitological and Molecular Evidence for a Possible Role of Sergentomyia Sand Flies;"Leishmania (L.) infantum is the causative agent in an endemic focus of canine leishmaniasis in the Mont-Rolland district (ThiÃ¨s, Senegal). In this area, the transmission cycle is well established and more than 30% of dogs and 20% of humans are seropositive for L. infantum. However, the sand fly species involved in L. infantum transmission cycle are still unknown. Between 2007 and 2010, 3654 sand flies were collected from different environments (indoor, peridomestic, farming and sylvatic areas) to identify the main L. infantum vector(s). Nine sand fly species were identified. The Phlebotomus genus (n = 54 specimens; Phlebotomus (Ph) duboscqi and Phlebotomus (Ph). rodhaini) was markedly under-represented in comparison to the Sergentomyia genus (n = 3600 specimens; Sergentomyia (Se) adleri, Se. clydei, Se. antennata, Se. buxtoni, Se. dubia, Se. schwetzi and Se. magna). Se. dubia and Se. schwetzi were the dominant species indoor and in peridomestic environments, near humans and dogs. Blood-meal analysis indicated their anthropophilic behavior. Some Se. schwetzi specimens fed also on dogs. The dissection of females in the field allowed isolating L. infantum from sand flies of the Sergentomyia genus (0.4% of Se. dubia and 0.79% of Se. schwetzi females). It is worth noting that one Se. dubia female not engorged and not gravid revealed highly motile metacyclic of L. infantum in the anterior part of the midgut. PCR-based diagnosis and sequencing targeting Leishmania kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) highlighted a high rate of L. infantum-positive females (5.38% of Se. dubia, 4.19% of Se. schwetzi and 3.64% of Se. magna). More than 2% of these positive females were unfed, suggesting the parasite survival after blood-meal digestion or egg laying. L. infantum prevalence in Se. schwetzi was associated with its seroprevalence in dogs and humans and L. infantum prevalence in Se. dubia was associated with its seroprevalence in humans. These evidences altogether strongly suggest that species of the Sergentomyia genus are probably the vectors of canine leishmaniasis in the Mont-Rolland area and challenge one more time the dogma that in the Old World, leishmaniasis is exclusively transmitted by species of the Phlebotomus genus.

The dogs were selected based on their close contact with foxes during fox bolting and because they had not traveled into known endemic areas. Using diagnostic PCR amplifying partial 18S rDNA fragment, Hepatozoon DNA was detected in 20 red foxes (95Â %) and 4 dogs (50Â %). From 8 positive foxes and 2 positive dogs, we obtained nearly complete 18S rDNA sequences. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences revealed very low variability. Buffy coat smears from positive dogs were prepared and examined. No Hepatozoon gamonts were found. This study provides the first report of autochthonous infection of H. canis/Hepatozoon in dogs and foxes from the Czech Republic. Our study indirectly demonstrates cross infection between red foxes and dogs and confirms autochthonous infection of Hepatozoon canis in dogs living in a geographic area well outside the range of Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, which is so far the only known vector of H. canis in Europe.

De Lima, A.L. Tartarotti, R.R. Ramos, F.A.P. De Araujo;Seroepidemiology of Leishmania infantum in dogs in the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil;Leishmaniosis are zoonoses that present several clinical manifestations in humans and have dogs as their main reservoir in the urban environment. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most severe form of the parasitosis and has been increasing in Brazil, despite the actions of public health agencies. Until 2002, the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) was considered free of human and canine leishmaniasis. The first human case of cutaneous leishmaniasis in RS was recorded in 2003. In 2009, the first autochthonous cases of human VL and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) were confirmed in SÃ£o Borja, RS, and the occurrence of the insect vector was recorded for the first time in the state. In 2010, the first confirmed case of CVL was reported and seropositive dogs were identified in the city of Porto Alegre, RS. Given the importance of this zoonosis and the difficulties of a reliable diagnosis in dogs, this study aimed to identify epidemiological aspects of CVL in dogs in an area of Porto Alegre where cases of the disease have been reported. A total of 300 blood samples were collected from dogs in this area, which were then tested by the methods of RT-DPPÂ® and ELISA for diagnosis of Leishmania infantum. An epidemiological questionnaire was completed by dog owners, containing aspects related to care of the animals, characteristics of their environment, and their living conditions. We observed that 83% (250/300) of the studied dogs were of mixed breed, 58% (175/300) were female, 78% (238/300) slept outdoors, and 61% (183/300) shared their living quarters with other species. Clinically, we observed that 90% (270/300) of the animals were infested by ectoparasites, 70% (210/300) had dermatopathies, 24% (72/300) presented weight loss and anorexia, and 22% (65/300) had ocular disorders. The results of the two serological tests were 100% concordant for the three seropositive samples (1%), and the remaining 297 (99%) were negative for both tests. We conclude that despite the low prevalence of L. infantum seropositive dogs, conditions in the region are favorable for CVL transmission, creating a risk of VL for the human population in the city of Porto Alegre.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;10.5433/1679-0359.2016v37n6p4077;;;;4084;;;;;;;6;Semina:Ciencias Agrarias;Dogs,Porto Alegre,Serologic Diagnosis,Visceral Leishmaniasis;;Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;4077;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85006295087&doi=10.5433%2f1679-0359.2016v37n6p4077&partnerID=40&md5=464ae476a69de609631dea418ee2750f;37;2016;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Diagnostic performance of different techniques for identifying CL was assessed. Isolates of Leishmania spp. were detected by in vitro culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on DNA extracted from dried filter papers and microscopic examination of direct lesion smears from patients visiting three major primary care hospitals in Peshawar. A total of 125 CL patients were evaluated. Many acquired the disease from Peshawar and the neighboring tribal area of Khyber Agency. Military personnel acquired CL while deployed in north and south Waziristan. Leishmania tropica was identified as the predominant infecting organism in this study (89.2%) followed by Leishmania major (6.8%) and, unexpectedly, Leishmania infantum (4.1%). These were the first reported cases of CL caused by L. infantum in Pakistan. PCR diagnosis targeting kinetoplast DNA was the most sensitive diagnostic method, identifying 86.5% of all samples found positive by any other method. Other methods were as follows: ribosomal DNA PCR (78.4%), internal transcribed spacer 2 region PCR (70.3%), culture (67.1%), and microscopy (60.5%). Clinical examination reported 14 atypical forms of CL. Atypical lesions were not significantly associated with the infecting Leishmania species, nor with ""dry"" or ""wet"" appearance of lesions. Findings from this study provide a platform for species typing of CL patients in Pakistan, utilizing a combination of in vitro culture and molecular diagnostics. Moreover, the clinical diversity described herein can benefit clinicians in devising differential diagnosis of the disease.

Zanella;West Nile virus transmission: Results from the integrated surveillance system in Italy, 2008 to 2015;In Italy a national Plan for the surveillance of imported and autochthonous human vector-borne diseases (chikungunya, dengue, Zika virus disease and West Nile virus (WNV) disease) that integrates human and veterinary (animals and vectors) surveillance, is issued and revised annually according with the observed epidemiological changes. Here we describe results of the WNV integrated veterinary and human surveillance systems in Italy from 2008 to 2015. A real time data exchange protocol is in place between the surveillance systems to rapidly identify occurrence of human and animal cases and to define and update the map of affected areas i.e. provinces during the vector activity period from June to October. WNV continues to cause severe illnesses in Italy during every transmission season, albeit cases are sporadic and the epidemiology varies by virus lineage and geographic area. The integration of surveillance activities and a multidisciplinary approach made it possible and have been fundamental in supporting implementation of and/or strengthening preventive measures aimed at reducing the risk of transmission of WNV trough blood, tissues and organ donation and to implementing further measures for vector control.

Walochnik;Could Phlebotomus mascittii play a role as a natural vector for Leishmania infantum? New data;Background: The occurrence of phlebotomine sand flies in Central Europe was questioned until they were recorded for the first time in Germany in 1999, and ten years later also in Austria. The aim of this study was to investigate sand flies collected in Austria for their carrier status of Leishmania spp. Findings: From 2012 to 2013 field studies were conducted in eastern Austria. Altogether, 22 individuals of sand flies were found, all morphologically identified as Phlebotomus (Transphlebotomus) mascittii Grassi, 1908. Twelve non-engorged female specimens with no visible remnants of a blood meal in their bodies were individually investigated for Leishmania spp. by ITS-1 real-time PCR. One out of these was positive for Leishmania, identified as Leishmania infantum by DNA sequencing. This finding suggests that L. infantum is not excreted by P. mascittii and possibly can establish an infection within P. mascittii. Interestingly, an asymptomatic dog living on the farm where this sand fly had been caught was also Leishmania-positive. Conclusions: This study provides new data on the suspected vector capacity of P. mascittii, being the northernmost sand fly species in Europe and in most central European regions the only sand fly species found. Proven vector capacity of P. mascittii for Leishmania spp. would be of significant medico-veterinary importance, not only with respect to expanding sand fly populations in Central Europe related to global warming, but also in the light of globalization and increasing movements of humans.

An epizootiological study was conducted to investigate the prevalence of H. canis in the canine population of ItuberÃ¡, Bahia, and to analyze any associated risk factors. Blood samples were collected from 380 dogs and determined the presence of the protozoan by performing capillary blood smear and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Epizootiological data were collected by asking dog owners to answer a structured questionnaire. H. canis gamonts were not detected in the blood smears. However, PCR detected H. canis in 163/380 (42.9%) dogs examined. Physical examination and anamnesis indicated 105 (64.4%) positive asymptomatic dogs. Hematological alterations were observed in 115 (70.5%) infected dogs. No clinical, hematological, or epizootiological variable was found to be significantly associated to the infection. In conclusion, the high prevalence of H. canis infection in local dogs may be because of the peri-urban features of this municipality. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this study the first study to report H. canis infection in the State of Bahia.

GÃ¼rÃ¼z;Seroprevalence of Leishmania infection and molecular detection of Leishmania tropica and Leishmania infantum in stray cats of IË™zmir, Turkey;Leishmaniasis caused by more than 20 species of genus Leishmania is transmitted by the bite of infected phlebotomine sand flies. The studies on Leishmania infection in cats is very few in Turkey and therefore we aimed to screen stray cats living in city of IË™zmir located in western Turkey using nested PCR targeting kinetoplast DNA and serological techniques (ELISA and IFA). Leishmania DNA positive samples were also studied by ITS1 real time PCR.Whole blood and serum samples were obtained from stray cats (n: 1101) living in different counties of IË™zmir. In serological assays, a serum sample was considered positive in 1:40 dilution in IFA and for ELISA a serum sample was accepted positive when the absorbance value (AV) exceeded the mean AV + Standard Deviation (SD) of the negative control serum samples.According to the results, the seropositivity rates were 10.8% (119/1101) and 15.2% (167/1101) by in house ELISA and IFA, respectively. Among serology coherent samples, the seropositivity rate was 11.1% (116/1047) as detected by both assays after discordant samples (n: 54) were discarded. Of the 1101 stray cats, six (0.54%) were positive by nested PCR while only one of these six samples was positive by ITS1 real time PCR.During PCR, three controls designated as Leishmania infantum, Leishmania tropica, and Leishmania major were used for species identification. According to nested PCR results, L. tropica was identified in two cats (no.76 and 95). In another cat (no. 269), there were two bands in which one of them was well-matched with L. infantum and the other band had ~850 bp size which does not match with any controls. Remaining three cats (no. 86, 514, and 622) also had the ~850 bp atypical band size. ITS1 real time PCR detected L. tropica in only one cat (no. 622) which showed an atypical band size in nested PCR. These results indicated that three cats with only one atypical band (no. 86, 514, and 622) and the cat with mixed infection (no. 269) were infected with L. tropica. Altogether, L. tropica was detected in all six DNA positive cats and L. infantum was detected in one cat with mixed infection.In conclusion, although the reservoir role of cats in nature is still unclear the high seroprevalence rate against Leishmania parasites and detecting parasite DNA in stray cats in IË™zmir indicates that the stray cats are frequently bitten by infected sand flies. Further research activities are required to reveal the frequency of leishmaniasis in cats in different regions of Turkey where Leishmania species are endemic.

Little;Prevalence of vector-borne pathogens in dogs from Haiti;"Canine vector-borne pathogens are common on some Caribbean islands, but survey data in Haiti are lacking. To determine the prevalence of selected vector-borne pathogens in dogs from Haiti, we tested blood samples collected from 210 owned dogs, 28 (13.3%) of which were infested with Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks at the time of blood collection. No other tick species were identified on these dogs. A commercially available ELISA identified antibodies to Ehrlichia spp. in 69 (32.9%), antibodies to Anaplasma spp. in 37 (17.6%), and antigen of Dirofilaria immitis in 55 (26.2%); antibodies to Borrelia burgdorferi were not detected in any sample. Molecular assays of whole blood from 207 of the dogs confirmed infection with Ehrlichia canis (15; 7.2%), Anaplasma platys (13; 6.3%), D. immitis (46; 22.2%), Wolbachia spp. (45; 21.7%), Babesia vogeli (16; 7.7%), and Hepatozoon canis (40; 19.3%), but Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia canis, Babesia rossi, Babesia gibsoni, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia ewingii, or Hepatozoon americanum were not detected. Co-infection with two or more vector-borne pathogens was detected by serology in 42 (20.0%) dogs and by molecular assays in 22 (10.6%) dogs; one dog was co-infected with B. vogeli and E. canis as detected by PCR with D. immitis detected by serology (antigen). Overall, evidence of past or current infection with at least one vector-borne pathogen was identified in 142/210 (67.6%) dogs in this study, underscoring the common nature of these pathogens, some of which are zoonotic, in Haiti.

Faustino;Molecular detection of Anaplasma platys, Ehrlichia canis, Hepatozoon canis and Rickettsia monacensis in dogs from Maio Island of Cape Verde archipelago;Tick-borne diseases are emerging worldwide and have an important zoonotic relevance. Dogs play an important role in the epidemiology of several zoonotic tick-borne pathogens acting as sentinels and/or reservoirs. This study focused on the molecular identification of tick-borne pathogens in blood samples of 153 autochthonous asymptomatic dogs in Maio Island, Cape Verde archipelago. Eighty-four (54.9%) dogs were positive for one or more pathogens. Fifty-five (35.9%) dogs were infected with Hepatozoon canis, 53 (34.6%) with Anaplasma platys, five (3.3%) with Ehrlichia canis and Rickettsia monacensis, an emerging human pathogen, was also identified in a single dog (0.7%). The former three pathogens cause important canine tick-borne diseases that are transmitted or potentially transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus s.l., the only hard tick identified in Cape Verde. Furthermore, Wolbachia spp. was amplified from the blood of one dog. None of the dogs were positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Midichloria mitochondrii, Bartonella spp., Babesia spp. or Theileria spp. Fifty-four (35.3%) animals showed single infections and 30 (19.6%) co-infections, with A. platys and H. canis co-infection being the most frequent (28 dogs, 18.3%). The frequency of E. canis infection was statistically different among age groups (PÂ =Â 0.017), being higher among dogs older than 4 years compared to younger dogs. Infection by A. platys was also statistically different among age groups (PÂ =Â 0.031), being higher in dogs younger than 2 years compared to older dogs. The statistical analyses showed no significant association of PCR positivity with gender or location. The frequency of tick-borne pathogens detected in dogs in Maio Island, including R. monacensis, highlights the need to improve diagnosis and control in order to prevent the risk of transmission of these pathogens among dogs and humans living in or travelling to this touristic island.

A cross-sectional survey on the presence of protozoan pathogens in ticks was carried out to assess the impact of tick-borne protozoa on domestic animals in Palestine. Ticks were collected from herds with sheep, goats and dogs in different geographic districts and their species were determined using morphological keys. The presence of piroplasms and Hepatozoon spp. was determined by PCR amplification of a 460â€“540Â bp fragment of the 18S rRNA gene followed by RFLP or DNA sequencing. A PCR-RFLP method based on the 18S rRNA was used in order to detect and to identify Hepatozoon, Babesia and Theileria spp. A total of 516 ticks were collected from animals in six Palestinian localities. Five tick species were found: Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato, Rhipicephalus turanicus, Rhipicephalus bursa, Haemaphysalis parva and Haemaphysalis adleri. PCR-based analyses of the ticks revealed Theileria ovis (5.4%), Hepatozoon canis (4.3%), Babesia ovis (0.6%), and Babesia vogeli (0.4%). Theileria ovis was significantly associated with ticks from sheep and with R. turanicus ticks (pÂ <Â 0.01). H. canis was detected only in R. sanguineus s.l. and was significantly associated with ticks from dogs (pÂ <Â 0.01). To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the presence of these pathogens in ticks collected from Palestine. Communicating these findings with health and veterinary professionals will increase their awareness, and contribute to improved diagnosis and treatment of tick-borne diseases.

Faye;First insights into the genetic diversity and origin of Leishmania infantum in Mont Rolland (ThiÃ¨s region, Senegal);Visceral leishmaniasis is not endemic in West Africa. However, high seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum infection (one of the Leishmania species that cause visceral leishmaniasis) was detected in dogs and humans in the Mont Rolland community (close to ThiÃ¨s, Senegal), despite the lack of reports concerning human clinical cases. Our aim was to genetically characterize this L. infantum population and identify its origin. We thus conducted seven field surveys in 25 villages of the Mont Rolland community between 2005 and 2009 and blood samples were collected from 205 dogs. Serological testing indicated that 92 dogs (44.9%) were positive for Leishmania infection. L. infantum was identified as the cause of infection. Analysis of 29 L. infantum isolates from these dogs by multilocus microsatellite typing and multilocus sequence typing indicated that this population had very limited genetic diversity, low level of heterozygosity and only seven different genotypes (79.3% of all isolates had the same genotype). Multilocus sequence typing showed that the Mont Rolland isolates clustered with strains from the Mediterranean basin and were separated from East African and Asian strains. Therefore, our data suggest a quite recent and unique introduction into Senegal of a L. infantum strain from the Mediterranean basin.

Horta;Epidemiological aspects and risk factors for infection by Leishmania infantum chagasi in dogs from municipality of Petrolina, Northeastern Brazil;"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a disease of great concern for public health because of its high incidence and lethality. Here, we performed a serologic study of domestic dogs in the municipality of Petrolina in northeastern Brazil to evaluate the possible risk factors associated with canine seropositivity for Leishmania infantum chagasi. Blood samples from 1245 dogs in urban and rural areas were collected and examined by indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The dogs were subjected to physical examination and classified according to their clinical manifestations. A questionnaire was administered to the owners to detect potential risk factors for infection with Leishmania spp. using logistic regression models. Of the 1245 dogs evaluated, 11.2% (140/1245) were seropositive in both tests (CI 95%: 9.5% to 13.1%). Approximately 60.7% of the reactive dogs were clinically suspect, with lymphadenomegaly, cutaneous ulcerations, onychogryphosis, pale mucous membranes and alopecia being the most obvious symptoms of infection. The seroprevalences in urban and rural areas were 5.4% (CI 95%: 4% to 7.1%) and 23.6% (CI 95%: 19.5% to 28.1%), respectively. The possible risk factors for the presence of anti L. infantum chagasi antibodies were the presence of a green area close to the home of the animal (ORÂ =Â 3.63; pÂ <Â 0.001), a mongrel breed (ORÂ =Â 2.11; pÂ =Â 0.025) and male gender (ORÂ =Â 1.51, pÂ =Â 0.034). The seroprevalence of L. infantum chagasi in the canine population is distributed in a heterogeneous manner, with a higher prevalence in rural areas.

Baneth;The quest for canine leishmaniasis in Romania: The presence of an autochthonous focus with subclinical infections in an area where disease occurred;Background: Canine leishmaniasis is a severe, potentially life-threatening, systemic vector-borne disease of dogs caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. Romania has been traditionally regarded as a non-endemic country for leishmaniasis with sporadic human disease cases. However, the recent report of an autochthonous canine leishmaniasis case (the first in the last 80 years) suggested the presence of an infection focus in the area of RÃ¢mnicu VÃ¢lcea. The present study describes a survey of canine leishmaniasis in this geographical area with comparison to a georeferenced dataset of sand fly distribution based on historical literature records. Methods: The study was carried out in RÃ¢mnicu VÃ¢lcea and included samples (serum, blood and conjunctival swabs) collected from 80 dogs including client-owned dogs from two local practices and dogs from two public shelters. Serum anti-leishmanial antibodies were assessed by ELISA. All blood and conjunctival samples were assessed by real-time quantitative PCR, targeting the leishmanial kinetoplast minicircle DNA. Results: Three dogs (3.7 %) were seropositive and another four (5.0 %) showed borderline results indicative of exposure or infection. TaqMan PCR was performed for all dogs, on both blood and conjunctival swabs. Seven dogs (8.7 %) were positive by conjunctival swab PCR and one dog (1.2 %) by blood PCR. None of the positive dogs presented clinical signs compatible with canine leishmaniasis. Conclusions: This is the first study evaluating canine leishmaniasis in a dog population in Romania by both highly sensitive PCR and serology. Although the prevalence was relatively low compared to other endemic regions, our results clearly demonstrate the presence of a canine leishmaniasis focus in Romania.

Inpankaew, S.F. Hii, W. Chimnoi, R.J. Traub;Canine vector-borne pathogens in semi-domesticated dogs residing in northern Cambodia;"Background: In Southeast Asia, the canine vector-borne pathogens Babesia spp., Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys, Hepatozoon canis, haemotropic mycoplasmas and Dirofilaria immitis cause significant morbidity and mortality in dogs. Moreover, dogs have also been implicated as natural reservoirs for Rickettsia felis, the agent of flea-borne spotted fever, increasingly implicated as a cause of undifferentiated fever in humans in Southeast Asia. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and diversity of canine vector-borne pathogens in 101 semi-domesticated dogs from rural Cambodia using molecular diagnostic techniques. Results: The most common canine vector-borne pathogens found infecting dogs in this study were Babesia vogeli (32.7 %) followed by Ehrlichia canis (21.8 %), Dirofilaria immitis (15.8 %), Hepatozoon canis (10.9 %), Mycoplasma haemocanis (9.9 %) and ""Candidatus Mycoplasma haematoparvum"" (2.9 %). A high level of co-infection with CVBD agents (23.8 %) was present, most commonly B. vogeli and E. canis. Naturally occurring R. felis infection was also detected in 10.9 % of dogs in support of their role as a natural mammalian reservoir for flea-borne spotted fever in humans. Conclusions: This study reports for the first time, the prevalence and diversity of CVBD pathogens in dogs in Cambodia. In total, five species of CVBD pathogens were found infecting semi-domesticated dogs and many were co-infected with two or more pathogens. This study supports the role of dogs as natural mammalian reservoirs for R. felis, the agent of flea-borne spotted fever in humans.

The occurrence of agents from the genera Anaplasma, Babesia, Ehrlichia and Hepatozoon was assessed in 103 domestic dogs from Luanda, by means of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequence analysis. Results: Forty-six dogs (44.7 %) were positive for at least one pathogen. Twenty-one animals (20.4 %) were found infected with Anaplasma platys, 18 (17.5 %) with Hepatozoon canis, six (5.8 %) with Ehrlichia canis, six (5.8 %) with Babesia vogeli, one (1.0 %) with Babesia gibsoni and one (1.0 %) with an unnamed Babesia sp. The molecular frequency of single infections taken together was 37.9 % and that of co-infections with several combinations of two pathogens accounted for 6.8 % of the animals. Conclusions: This is the first report of A. platys, B. vogeli, B. gibsoni, E. canis and H. canis infections diagnosed by PCR in domestic dogs from Angola. The present study provides evidence that dogs in Luanda are widely exposed to, and at risk of becoming infected with, tick-borne pathogens. Further investigation is needed, including a larger number of animals, canine populations from other cities and provinces of the country, as well as potential vector ticks, aiming at better characterizing and controlling canine vector-borne diseases in Angola.

Pennisi;Detection of vector-borne pathogens in cats and their ectoparasites in southern Italy;Background: Vector-borne pathogens are the subject of several investigations due to the zoonotic concern of some of them. However, limited data are available about the simultaneous presence of these pathogens in cats and their ectoparasites. The aim of the present study was to define the species of ectoparasites found on cats as well as to investigate vector-borne pathogens in cats and their ectoparasites in southern Italy. Methods: Blood from 42 cats and fleas or flea pools (n = 28) and ticks (n = 73) collected from them were investigated by quantitative PCR for the detection of vector-borne pathogens. Feline serum samples were tested by IFAT to detect IgG antibodies against Leishmania infantum, Bartonella henselae, Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia felis, Rickettsia typhi, Babesia microti, Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum antigens. Results: Only one flea species (Ctenocephalides felis) and four tick species belonging to the genera Rhipicephalus and Ixodes were identified on cats from southern Italy. Molecular evidence of Bartonella spp., Rickettsia spp., hemoplasmas, Babesia vogeli and L. infantum was found in ectoparasites (fleas and/or ticks) while DNA from Hepatozoon felis and Ehrlichia/Anaplasma spp. was not detected. Likewise, DNAs from Bartonella, hemoplasma and Leishmania were the only pathogens amplified from feline blood samples. Cats had also antibodies against all the investigated pathogens with the exception of Rickettsia typhi. Agreement between serological and molecular results in individual cats and their ectoparasites was not found. The only exception was for Bartonella with a fair to moderate agreement between individual cats and their ectoparasites. Bartonella clarridgeiae was the species most frequently found in cats and their fleas followed by B. henselae. Conclusions: In conclusion, cats harboring ticks and fleas are frequently exposed to vector-borne pathogens. Furthermore, ticks and fleas harbored by cats frequently carry pathogens of zoonotic concern therefore appropriate feline ectoparasiticide preventative treatments should be used in cats.

CristÃ³vÃ£o, M.D. Tabar, O. Francino, L. Cardoso, L. Campino, X. Roura;Molecular detection of Leishmania infantum, filariae and Wolbachia spp. in dogs from southern Portugal;"Background: Leishmaniosis caused by the protozoan Leishmania infantum and dirofilariosis caused by the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis or Dirofilaria repens are vector-borne zoonoses widely present in the Mediterranean basin. In addition, some studies reported that the endosymbiont Wolbachia spp. play a role in the biology and pathogenesis of filarial parasites. The aim of this work was to evaluate the frequency of mono- and co-infections by L. infantum, filariae and Wolbachia spp. and their association with clinical signs in dogs from the south of Portugal. Leishmanial, filarial and Wolbachia spp. DNA were evaluated by specific real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays in blood samples from 230 dogs. Findings: One hundred and thirty-nine (60.4 %) dogs were qPCR-positive for L. infantum and 26 (11.3 %) for filariae (24 for D. immitis only, one D. immitis and for Acanthocheilonema dracunculoides and another one for Acanthocheilonema reconditum only). Wolbachia spp. DNA was amplified from 16 (64.0 %) out of the 25 D. immitis-positive dogs. Nineteen (8.3 %) dogs were co-infected with L. infantum and D. immitis, including the one (0.4 %) A. drancunculoides-positive animal. In dogs without clinical signs consistent with leishmaniosis and/or dirofilariosis, L. infantum prevalence was 69 %, whereas in those dogs with at least one clinical manifestation compatible with any of the two parasitoses prevalence was 42.7 %. Leishmania prevalence was significantly higher in apparently healthy mongrels (77.2 %) and pets (76.9 %) than in defined-breed dogs (including crosses; 58.8 %) and in dogs with an aptitude other than pet (i.e. farm, guard, hunting, shepherd or stray), respectively, whereas in those dogs with at least one clinical sign, the detection of L. infantum DNA was higher in males (53.3 %) and in those dogs not receiving insect repellents (52.8 %). Conclusions: The molecular detection of canine vector-borne disease (CVBD) agents, some of which are zoonotic, reinforces the need to implement efficient prophylactic measures, such as insect repellents and macrocyclic lactones (including compliance to administration), in the geographical areas where these agents are distributed, with the view to prevent infection and disease among mammalian hosts including humans.

Schnyder, F. Grimm, A.C. CustÃ³dio, L. Cardoso, P. Deplazes, L.M. De Carvalho;Seroprevalence of vector-borne pathogens and molecular detection of Borrelia afzelii in military dogs from Portugal;"Background: Canine vector-borne diseases (CVBDs) are increasingly being reported worldwide and represent a serious threat to both animal and public health. Military dogs may constitute a risk group for the agents causing these diseases, as they frequently work outdoors in different areas and are thus exposed to vector arthropods. In order to assess the risk of exposure of this type of dogs, a serological and molecular survey was conducted in military working dogs in Portugal. One hundred apparently healthy dogs were surveyed. Serum samples were tested for antigens of Angiostrongylus vasorum and Dirofilaria immitis; and for antibodies to A. vasorum, Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Ehrlichia canis, Leishmania infantum, Rickettsia spp. and Toscana virus. Serum was tested by polymerase chain reaction for Borrelia burgdorferi (sensu lato), with sequencing of the DNA products. Results: Forty-nine per cent of the dogs were seropositive for antibodies against Rickettsia spp., 16 % for Anaplasma spp., 13 % for L. infantum, 7 % for E. canis, 5 % for A. vasorum (including 1 % positive for both antibodies and circulating antigens), 3 % for Babesia spp. and 1 % positive for Toscana virus. B. burgdorferi (s.l.) was detected in eight out of 94 dogs tested (8.5 %) and in three cases (3.2 %) nucleotide sequence analysis showed identity with the genospecies Borrelia afzelii. No positive cases were recorded for D. immitis. Overall, 66 % of the dogs were positive for at least one out of the eight tested CVBD agents, six of which are zoonotic (i.e. Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., E. canis, L. infantum, Rickettsia spp. and Toscana virus). Serological specific antibody detection against more than one CVBD agent (including molecular detection of Borrelia spp.) was recorded in 25 % of the dogs, comprising 19 % with positive reaction to two agents, 5 % to three agents and 1 % to four agents. Conclusions: These results reveal a high occurrence of CVBD agents in military working dogs in Portugal and highlight the need to maintain a comprehensive and regular prophylaxis to reduce the contact between working dogs and those pathogens. For the first time in Portugal, B. afzelii DNA was identified in dogs and a dog was found seropositive for antibodies against Toscana virus.

RodrÃ­guez;Detection of Leishmania DNA in wild foxes and associated ticks in Patagonia, Argentina, 2000 km south of its known distribution area;"Background: Zoonotic Visceral Leishmaniasis (ZVL) is a vector-borne disease affecting humans and other mammals and caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum (syn. L. chagasi), belonging to the L. donovani complex. The regions in Northern Argentina (above 32 Â°S) are its southern distribution limit in South America. Results: We detected Leishmania sp. DNA (most likely belonging to the L. donovani complex) in 37.5 % of 32 grey foxes (Pseudalopex griseus) captured in Argentinean Patagonia (48Â°S and 50Â°S). Eleven monosexual pools of Amblyomma tigrinum ticks from eight different foxes (six grey foxes and two culpeo foxes P. culpaeus) were also positive. The southernmost known distribution limit for L. infantum, and the southernmost reported capture of a phlebotominae, had previously been 2000 and 750 km north of our study area, respectively. Conclusions: This finding is significant because it markedly extends the distribution area of leishmaniasis; supports the existence of a sylvatic cycle in the absence of dogs; and has implications in transmission, indicating that either sand fly distribution is broader than currently thought or non-sand fly Leishmania maintenance is possible. Additional molecular, parasitological, epidemiological and entomological studies are still needed.

Aguiar;A survey of tick-borne pathogens in dogs and their ticks in the Pantanal biome, Brazil;"Tick and blood samples collected from domestic dogs in the Brazilian Pantanal were tested by molecular methods for the presence of tick-borne protozoa and bacteria. Among 320 sampled dogs, 3.13% were infected by Babesia vogeli (Piroplasmida: Babesiidae), 8.75% by Hepatozoon canis (Eucoccidiorida: Hepatozoidae), 7.19% by Anaplasma platys (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae), and 0.94% by an unclassified Anaplasma sp. In three tick species collected from dogs, the following tick-borne agents were detected: (a) B. vogeli, An. platys and Ehrlichia canis (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae), infecting Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato (Ixodida: Ixodidae) ticks; (b) H. canis, an unclassified Anaplasma sp. and Rickettsia amblyommii (Rickettsiales: Rickettsiaceae), infecting Amblyomma cajennense sensu lato (Ixodida: Ixodidae) ticks, and (c) Rickettsia sp. strain Atlantic rainforest, an emerging human pathogen, infecting Amblyomma ovale ticks. Molecular analysis, based on a mitochondrial gene, revealed that the Am. cajennense s.l. ticks of the present study corresponded to Amblyomma sculptum, a member of the Am. cajennense species complex, and that Rh. sanguineus s.l. belonged to the tropical lineage. Whereas dogs are exposed to a number of tick-borne bacterial and protozoan agents in the Pantanal biome, humans are potentially exposed to infection by spotted fever group rickettsiae (e.g. R. amblyommii and Rickettsia sp. strain Atlantic rainforest) because both Am. sculptum and Am. ovale are among the most important human-biting ticks in Brazil.

KuÅŸadasi town, belonging to Aydin province and located in western part of Turkey, is endemic for human and canine visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum MON1 and MON98.In this study, phlebotomine survey was conducted to determine the vector sand fly species and to identify sand fly blood meal sources. In August and September 2012, 1027 sand fly specimens were caught using CDC light traps. Eight Phlebotomus and two Sergentomyia species with the dominancy of Phlebotomus tobbi (61.34%) were detected. A total of 622 female sand flies (571 Phlebotomus; 51 Sergentomyia) were checked for Leishmania infection by direct dissection of the midgut. The half of the midgut content was inoculated into NNN culture for isolation of the parasite. Leishmania species-specific ITS1 real time PCR, conventional PCR assays of ITS1 and hsp70 genes and subsequent sequencing were performed from extracted DNAs. A region of cytochrome b (cyt-b) gene of vertebrates based PCR was used to determine the source of blood meal of sand flies.In microscopical examinations, two female specimens (0.32%) were found naturally infected with high number and different stages of promastigotes. No growth was observed in NNN culture but Leishmania DNA was obtained from both specimens. First positive specimen was identified as P. tobbi and L. infantum DNA was detected. Second specimen was Sergentomyia dentata, but Leishmania DNA could not be identified on species level. A total of 16 blood-fed female P. tobbi specimens were used for blood meal analysis and eight, three and one specimens were positive for human, dog and mouse, respectively.This is the first detection of Leishmania promastigotes using microscopical examination in P. tobbi and S. dentata in human and canine visceral leishmaniasis endemic area in western part of Turkey. Our results indicate that, (i) P. tobbi is the principal vector species and (ii) human and dogs are main blood sources. The detection of Leishmania sp. in Sergentomyia species may be an evidence for natural cycle of Sauro-leishmania agents in the area.

Methods: Extensive epidemiological and entomological investigations in and around the focus were carried out. Leishmaniasis infection was confirmed by histopathology, indirect fluorescent antibody test, real-time PCR, and culture. Parasite strain was typed by the isoenzymatic technique. Results: The survey revealed close contacts between the autochthonous dog and two infected bitches imported from Spain, but failed to find any possible vector or disease spreading to other animals or humans. L. infantum zymodeme MON-1, the most frequent type in the Mediterranean basin, was identified. Although transplacental and venereal transmissions could not be excluded, the evidence was in favour of non-vectorial, direct dog-to-dog transmission. Conclusions: This study corroborates the possibility of non-vectorial routes (transplacental, venereal, and direct dog-to-dog) of canine leishmaniasis transmission in New Caledonia and raises the debate of relevant test requirements and diagnostic sensitivity prior to importation of dogs in Leishmania-free regions. New leishmaniasis control measures and recommendations to avoid future CanL introduction on the island are discussed.

Eight different pathogens, namely Babesia vogeli, Hepatozoon canis, Leishmania infantum, Dirofilaria immitis, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Anaplasma platys, Ehrlichia canis, and Mycoplasma haemocanis, were detected by direct methods with prevalence rates ranging from 1 to 9Â %.

More than half (51.7Â %) of the dogs were seroreactive to T. gondii and 18.3Â % to N. caninum. This is the first report on the detection of A. phagocytophilum, A. platys, E. canis, and M. haemocanis by PCR as well as the serological confirmation of exposure of dogs to N. caninum and T. gondii in Albania. The spectrum of pathogens and the seroprevalences for N. caninum and T. gondii in client-owned dogs from Tirana, Albania, are comparable to that reported in other countries in the Mediterranean Basin. The prevalence rates of vector-borne pathogens are at the lower range of that reported in studies from this geographical region. This is probably due to increased awareness of the owners of pet dogs, including better husbandry conditions and ectoparasiticidal treatment, thus limiting exposure of dogs to vectors.

Veras;The Rapid Test Based on Leishmania infantum Chimeric rK28 Protein Improves the Diagnosis of Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis by Reducing the Detection of False-Positive Dogs;"Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) has spread to many urban centers worldwide. Dogs are considered the main reservoir of VL, because canine cases often precede the occurrence of human cases. Detection and euthanasia of serologically positive dogs is one of the primary VL control measures utilized in some countries, including Brazil. Using accurate diagnostic tests can minimize one undesirable consequence of this measure, culling false-positive dogs, and reduce the maintenance of false-negative dogs in endemic areas. In December 2011, the Brazilian Ministry of Health replaced the ELISA (EIE CVL) screening method and Indirect Immunofluorescence Test (IFI CVL) confirmatory method with a new protocol using the rapid DPP CVL screening test and EIE CVL confirmatory test. A study of diagnostic accuracy of these two protocols was done by comparing their performance using serum samples collected from a random sample of 780 dogs in an endemic area of VL. All samples were evaluated by culture and real time PCR; 766 out of the 780 dogs were tested using the previous protocol (IFI CVL + EIE CVL) and all 780 were tested using the current protocol (DPP CVL + EIE CVL). Performances of both diagnostic protocols were evaluated using a latent class variable as the gold standard. The current protocol had a higher specificity (0.98 vs. 0.95) and PPV (0.83 vs. 0.70) than the previous protocol, although sensitivity of these two protocols was similar (0.73). When tested using sera from asymptomatic animals, the current protocol had a much higher PPV (0.63 vs. 0.40) than the previous protocol (although the sensitivity of either protocol was the same, 0.71). Considering a range of theoretical CVL prevalences, the projected PPVs were higher for the current protocol than for the previous protocol for each theoretical prevalence value. The findings presented herein show that the current protocol performed better than previous protocol primarily by reducing false-positive results.

Boulassel;Leishmania infantum and Epstein-Barr virus co-infection in a patient with hemophagocytosis;The authors describe a rare case of a 27- year old previously healthy male presenting with high grade fever, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, high levels of ferritin and triglyceride, suggesting a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) syndrome. Other investigations showed a positive Leishmania infantum serology and high Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viremia. The diagnosis of a visceral leishmaniasis was confirmed by bone morrow biopsy, which showed Leishman-Donovan bodies and evidence of HLH. The patient received liposomal amphotericin B and he had a complete resolution of his symptoms and clearance of EBV viremia. This case of HLH associated with visceral leishmaniasis and EBV co-infection raises the question about the significance of EBV in patients with HLH. The treatment of actual etiological agent can lead to complete cure while using current recommend chemotherapy for HLH-related EBV in a patient with hidden infection may have deleterious effects.

In Mexico there is not enough data available about their surveillance. This study aimed to detect the prevalence of Hepatozoon by PCR in domestic animals and ticks from a fragmented rainforest area from southeast Mexico and analyze the phylogeographic structure of the parasites detected. The total prevalence of H. canis in mammals was 9.7% (20/206; 95% Confidence limits: 6.0â€“14.6%), being dogs the species with the highest prevalence, of 63.3% (19/30; 95% Confidence limits: 43.9â€“80.1%). The phylogenetic analysis revealed that sequences from this study were closer to the sequence of H. canis of domestic origin, rather than from wild origin, but in an independent cluster. Haplotypes from our study were geographically restricted to Mexico and the closest haplotype was from Brazil. Ticks that resulted positive by PCR were identified as Amblyomma cajennense (A. mixtus) and Rhipicephalus turanicus. Under fragmented and disturbed conditions of habitat in Balancan, the presence of H. canis may represent a potential risk for other species of domestic and wildlife animals. To the knowledge of the authors, this study represents the first molecular finding of H. canis in Mexico in both domestic animals and ticks. This research lays the groundwork for further studies in order to elucidate the relationships between domestic hosts, wildlife and ticks and describe the life cycle of this parasite in the area.

Dolabela De Lima, V.M.F. de Lima;Natural canine infection by Leishmania infantum and Leishmania amazonensis and their implications for disease control;Leishmaniasis is a major public health problem worldwide. Because Leishmania can adapt to new hosts or vectors, knowledge concerning the current etiological agent in dogs is important in endemic areas. This study aimed to identify the Leishmania species detected in 103 samples of peripheral blood from dogs that were naturally infected with these protozoa. The diagnosis of leishmaniasis was determined through parasitological examination, the indirect enzymeâ€‘linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The Leishmania species were identified by means of PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The samples were subjected to PCR using oligonucleotide primers that amplify the intergenic region ITS1 of the rRNA gene in order to identify the species. The amplified DNA was digested using the restriction enzyme HaeIII. A restriction profile identical to L. amazonensis was shown in 77/103 samples and the profile was similar to L. infantum in 17/103. However, a mixed profile was shown in 9/103 samples, which impeded species identification. In conclusion, the infection in these dogs was predominantly due to L. amazonensis, thus indicating that diagnosing of cases of canine leishmaniasis needs to be reexamined, since the causative agent identified is not restricted to L. infantum.

During 2014â€“2015, a total of 408 sera were collected from healthy household dogs and tested for L. infantum and T. gondii infection using commercial ELISA kits. The endemic characteristics according to gender, age group and breed were revealed by statistical descriptions and inference. The positive rates of L. infantum infection (24/408, 5.9%) were lower than those of T. gondii infection (37/408, 9.1%), and co-infection with both parasites was detected in seven dogs (7/408, 1.7%). Seropositivity for either parasite was more likely associated with age: the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection ranged from 1.3% (dogsâ‰¤1 year) â€“ 18.7% (dogs>6 years), whereas that of L. infantum ranged from 1.3% (dogsâ‰¤1 year) â€“ 9.9 % (dogs>6 years). Interestingly, the rates of exposure to both L. infantum and T. gondii were higher in males than in females. Relatively higher exposure rates for L. infantum and T. gondii were also observed in crossbred dogs compared with purebred dogs. However, neither gender nor breed is likely a determining factor for infection with these two parasites (P > 0.05). Identification of the risk factors that underlie these differences may help in the prevention of L. infantum and T. gondii infection in household dogs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of L. infantum and T. gondii infection in household dogs in Shanghai, which shows that these two important parasites are still prevalent in this region. Therefore, it is necessary to take integrated strategies for prevention and control of infection in animals, which could help to reduce human infection in the region.

The present study sought to investigate the fauna in this city using Shannon and Disney traps, having human beings and hamsters, respectively, as bait. Both types of traps were installed in forest fragment and peridomiciliary areas in the period from 2007 to 2009. The phlebotomine females were analyzed by PCR for Leishmania identification. Lutzomyia longipalpis was the only species collected in the peridomiciles and rendered a total of 574 specimens with a 5.2:1 male:female ratio. A total of eight species were attracted to the two traps (one of each type) installed in the forest fragment, including: Bichromomyia flaviscutellata, Evandromyia bourrouli, Evandromyia lenti, Lutzomyia longipalpis, Nyssomyia whitmani, Pintomyia christenseni, Psathyromyia bigeniculata, and Sciopemyia sordellii. A total of 143 specimens were collected, Bi. flaviscutellata accounting for 81% and Lu. longipalpis for 1.4% of them. In one female of Lu. longipalpis collected in a Disney trap installed in a peridomicile, Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum DNA was found, thus strengthening the hypothesis that the transmission of leishmaniasis is in fact occurring in the anthropic environment.

The aim of this study was to investigate VL dynamics in a prospective cohort study of dogs in Juatuba, between 2010 and 2011, to confirm the incidence of Leishmania infantum, and to assess possible risk factors associated with infection. An observational and prospective closed cohort study was performed using serology testing in dogs, randomly selected from the whole municipality. All seronegative dogs, or dogs with inconclusive results were monitored using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) at 6-month intervals. The dog's owners completed a semi-structured questionnaire to assess possible causal factors of seroconversion, and the responses were assessed using logistic regression. The canine incidence coefficient was 206/1,000 dogs per year (CI: 178-238), and a cluster was identified in an area with a high concentration of seropositive dogs, but a low overall canine population. Large dogs were identified as a risk factor and the following variables were identified as protection factors: dogs aged over 4 years, daily peridomicile cleaning, and better socioeconomic conditions. VL is spreading over a large area in Juatuba in a short period of time.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;10.1590/1678-4162-8893;;;;1412;;;;;;;6;Arquivo Brasileiro de Medicina Veterinaria e Zootecnia;Cluster,Incidence,Leishmaniasis,Risk factors,Seroconversion;;Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;1403;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008384609&doi=10.1590%2f1678-4162-8893&partnerID=40&md5=bb1d80adfc7170164b978ece613c2588;68;2016;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

A total of 1,043 dogs were tested, and the serological diagnoses of Chagas disease (CD) and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) was performed by the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Animals that tested seropositive for both diseases (by IFAT) were further subjected to ELISA. Of the 1,043 dogs 81 (7.8%; 95% CI = 6.1-9.4%) tested seropositive for Leishmania spp., while 83 were seropositive for T. cruzi (7.9%; 95% CI = 6.3-9.6%). Simultaneous serological reactions were detected in 49 animals (4.6%; 95% CI= 3.6-6.2%). Semi-domiciled housing (OR = 2.044), free housing (OR = 4.151), and soil (OR = 3.425) and soil/cement (OR = 3.065) environmental conditions were identified as risk factors for CVL seropositivity. The risk factors identified for CD seropositivity were semi-domiciled (OR = 2.353) or free housing (OR = 3.454), and contact with bovine (OR = 2.015). This study revealed the presence of dogs in the ParaÃ­ba State seropositive for CVL and CD, suggesting the need for revisiting and intensification of disease control measures through constant monitoring of the canine population.

Harrus;Molecular detection of emerging tick-borne pathogens in Vojvodina, Serbia;Ticks play an important role in disease transmission globally due to their capability to serve as vectors for human and animal pathogens. The Republic of Serbia is an endemic area for a large number of tick-borne diseases. However, current knowledge on these diseases in Serbia is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of new emerging tick-borne pathogens in ticks collected from dogs and the vegetation from different parts of Vojvodina, Serbia.A total of 187 ticks, including 124 Rhipicephalus sanguineus, 45 Ixodes ricinus and 18 Dermacentor reticulatus were collected from dogs. In addition, 26 questing I. ricinus ticks were collected from the vegetation, using the flagging method, from 4 different localities in Vojvodina, Serbia. DNA was extracted from each tick individually and samples were tested by either conventional or real-time PCR assays for the presence of Rickettsia spp.-DNA (gltA and ompA gene fragments), Ehrlichia/. Anaplasma spp.-DNA (16S rRNA gene fragment) and Hepatozoon spp./. Babesia spp.-DNA (18S rRNA gene fragment). In addition, all I. ricinus DNA samples were tested for Bartonella spp.-DNA (ITS locus) by real-time PCR.In this study, the presence of novel emerging tick-borne pathogens including Rickettsia raoultii, Rickettsia massiliae, Babesia venatorum, Babesia microti, Hepatozoon canis and Candidatus Neoehrlichia mikurensis was identified for the first time in Serbia. Our findings also confirmed the presence of Rickettsia monacensis, Babesia canis and Anaplasma phagocytophilum in ticks from Serbia.The findings of the current study highlight the great diversity of tick-borne pathogens of human and animal importance in Serbia. Physicians, public health workers and veterinarians should increase alertness to the presence of these tick-borne pathogens in this country.

Among the rural samples, 40 were collected in riverine communities and 26 were collected in Indian communities, both along the Purus River. During the sampling, a questionnaire was applied to obtain information relating to sex, age, living in dryland or seasonally flooded areas, access to the streets (for urban dogs) and access to forests. The presence of antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Leishmania infantum chagasi and Leishmania amazonensis was detected by means of the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) with cutoffs of 16, 50, 40 and 40, respectively. The association of each qualitative variable, with each parasite and positivity for each of them, were evaluated X2 test (p < 0.05). T. gondii, N. caninum and L. amazonensis antibodies were found, respectively, in 61.6%, 7.1% and 8.1% of the animals examined. None of the samples were positive for L. infantum chagasi. The variable of living in an urban area (p = 0.041) presented an association with occurrence of T. gondii and the positivity for T. gondii increased with age of the dogs (p = 0.0006). The variable of male sex presented an association with N. caninum (p = 0.018) and no variable presented any association with L. amazonensis. The antibody titers against T. gondii ranged from 64 to 32,768; against N. caninum from 100 to 800; and against L. amazonensis from 40 to 640. Both T. gondii and L. amazonensis are important zoonotic agents and are active in this region. The municipality studied, and especially its riverine communities, has geographic, social and ecological peculiarities. This region requires greater attention from the authorities for controlling these agents. Â© 2016, Universidade de Sao Paulo. Faculdade de Medicina Veterinaria e Zootecnia.

Several studies have identified dogs as the main reservoirs of the VL caused by Leishmania infantum in Iran and other Mediterranean regions. This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis as animal reservoir host for human visceral leishmaniasis in Boyer Ahmad district in southwest of Iran. Methods: A seroepidemiological study was carried out to determine the seroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) among ownership dogs by using direct agglutination test (DAT) in 23 of 182 villages of Boyer Ahmad district, during August 2009 to August 2010. One hundred and seventy serum samples from ownership dogs were selected by multi-stage cluster sampling in villages of Boyer Ahmad district. All samples were tested by DAT and anti-Leishmania antibodies titers at â‰¥ 1:320 was considered as positive. Results: Of the 170 serum samples, 10% were positive by DAT at titers of 1:320 and higher. No statistical significant difference was found between male (10.7%) and female (8.3%) seroprevalence. The highest seroprevalence rate (15.1%) was observed among the ownership dogs of four to seven years age. Altogether, seventeen (25.4%) of the seropositive dogs had clinical signs and symptoms.

It is endemic in some parts of provinces of Iran. According to the reported cases of VL in Kermanshah Province in recent years, this study was conducted to determine the seroprevalence of VL in high risk villages of the province. Methods: Totally, 1622 serum samples obtained from children under 15 years old and 178 from adults in 22 villages of studied areas. Serum samples were examined by direct agglutination test (DAT) for the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies. Data were analyzed using SPSS software ver.11.5. Results: Only 6 serum samples (0.33%) showed anti-Leishmania antibodies against L.infantum at titers â‰¥ 1/3200. Four of the seropositive cases had a history of kala-azar and Leishman bodies were seen in their bone marrows. The highest (0.5%) and lowest (0.29%) seroprevalence was seen in the age groups of 5-9 and 10-14 years old, respectively. None of the adults were seropositive. There were not any significant differences between the rate of seropositivity in males (0.36%) and females (0.31%). 66.7% of seropositive individuals showed clinical manifestations. The most important symptoms in Kala-azar patients were fever, hepatospleenomegally and anemia. Conclusion: Kala-azar is occurred sporadically in Kermanshah Province.

In this study we followed the prevalence of human visceral leishmaniasis and of Leishmania infantum infection in stray dogs of an endemic area of visceral leishmaniasis at periods of time between 1997 and 2010. Prevalence of human visceral leishmaniasis had two peaks (40 cases) in 1997 and 2006 with sharp declines to 2 cases in 2001 and to 5 cases in 2008. Similar fluctuations were also observed in the occurrence of positive spleen culture and anti- Leishmania serology in dogs, although the proportion of dogs with active spleen parasitism remained relatively high even in the periods of low prevalence of human disease. These observations support the notion that stray dogs may constitute a renewable source of parasites, capable of sustaining the persistence of the infection in urban areas, even in periods of low transmission by phlebotomines.

Babba;Geographical distribution updating of Tunisian leishmaniasis foci: About the isoenzymatic analysis of 694 strains;"Over a period of ten years, a series of 694 Leishmania strains from Tunisian leishmaniasis foci were isolated and identified by isoenzymatic analysis. Strains were obtained from human cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in immunocompetent subjects, visceral leishmaniasis in imunocompromised individuals and from dogs with visceral leishmaniasis. Two classically dermotropic species, Leishmania (L.) major and Leishmania killicki were found. L. major with the single zymodeme MON-25 was the most isolated in cutaneous leishmaniasis foci of the Centre and South of Tunisia with a recent northern extension. L. killicki zymodeme MON-8 was sporadically found both in its classical microfocus of Tataouine in southeastern Tunisia as well as in some new foci in Southwestern, Central and Northern Tunisia. Leishmania infantum with its three zymodemes MON-1, MON-24 and MON-80 was isolated from both visceral and cutaneous human cases. The majority of L. infantum strains were found in the Northern part of the country; however, some strains were reported for the first time in the Southern part. L. infantum MON-1 was the only zymodeme isolated from canine leishmaniasis.

Bustamante, R. Porrozzi;Canine cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by neotropical Leishmania infantum despite of systemic disease: A case report;Visceral leishmaniasis is an anthropozoonosis caused by a protozoan Leishmania infantum (syn. Leishmania chagasi). Here, we report a typical case of canine cutaneous leishmaniasis due to L. infantum infection without any other systemic symptom in one dog in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A mongrel female dog was admitted in a veterinary clinic with reports of chronic wounds in the body. Physical examination revealed erosive lesions in the limbs, nasal ulcers, presence of ectoparasites and seborrheic dermatitis. Blood samples and fragments of healthy and injured skin were collected. The complete hemogram revealed aregenerative normocytic normochromic anemia and erythrocyte rouleaux, and biochemical analysis revealed normal renal and hepatic functions. Cytology of the muzzle and skin lesions suggested pyogranulomatous inflammatory process. The histopathology of a skin fragment was performed and revealed suspicion of protozoa accompanied by necrotizing dermatitis. The diagnosis of leishmaniasis was accomplished by positive serology, isolation of Leishmania from the skin lesion, and also by molecular test (PCR targeting the conserved region of Leishmania kDNA). Culture was positive for damaged skin samples. PCR targeting a fragment of Leishmania hsp70 gene was performed employing DNA extracted from damaged skin. RFLP of the amplified hsp70 fragment identified the parasite as L. infantum, instead of Leishmania braziliensis, the main agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Rio de Janeiro. Characterization of isolated promastigotes by five different enzymatic systems confirmed the species identification of the etiological agent. Serology was positive by ELISA and rapid test. This case warns to the suspicion of viscerotropic Leishmania in cases of chronic skin lesions and brings the discussion of the mechanisms involved in the parasite tissue tropism.

Carneiro;Low Parasite Load Estimated by qPCR in a Cohort of Children Living in Urban Area Endemic for Visceral Leishmaniasis in Brazil;"Background: An important issue associated with the control of visceral leishmaniasis is the need to identify and understand the relevance of asymptomatic infection caused by Leishmania infantum. The aim of this study was to follow the course of asymptomatic L. infantum infection in children in an area of Brazil where it is endemic. The children were assessed twice during a 12-month period. Methodology: In this population study, 1875 children, ranging from 6 months to 7 years of age, were assessed. Blood samples were collected on filter papers via finger prick and tested by ELISA (L. infantum soluble antigen and rk39). Seropositives samples (n = 317) and a number of seronegatives samples (n = 242) were subjected to qPCR. After 12 months, blood samples were collected from a subgroup of 199 children and tested for Leishmania spp. to follow the course of infection. Principal Findings: At baseline qPCR testing identified 82 positive samples. The prevalence rate, as estimated for 1875 children based on the qPCR results, was 13.9%. The qPCR testing of whole blood samples collected from a cohort of children after 12 months (n = 199) yielded the following results: of the 44 (22.1%) children with positive qPCR results at baseline, only 10 (5.0%) remained positive, and 34 (17.1%) became negative; and of the 155 (77.9%) children with negative qPCR results, 131 (65.8%) remained negative, and 24 (12.1%) became positive at the follow-up measurement. The samples with positive findings at baseline (n = 82) had a mean of 56.5 parasites/mL of blood; and at follow-up the mean positive result was 7.8 parasites/mL. Conclusions: The peripheral blood of asymptomatic children had a low and fluctuating quantity of Leishmania DNA and a significant decrease in parasitemia at 1-year follow-up. Quantitative PCR enables adequate monitoring of Leishmania infection.

The present study clarifies the clinico-epidemiologic profile of CL and the molecular genotyping of the Leishmania spp. in the Nalut district, Libya. Two hundred and twenty-three CL patients were examined at the out-patient clinics of Nalut Hospital from March 2006 to February 2007. CL was diagnosed by clinical, microscopic, culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses. The disease was observed year-round, with the highest prevalence between November and February. Fifty-nine percent of patients were younger than 20 yr. Nodulo-ulcerative lesions, indurated ulcers, papulo-ulcerative lesions, and subcutaneous nodular lesions were observed in 170, 25, 15, and 13 patients, respectively. Two hundred patients (89.7%) had dry type of lesions, whereas 23 patients (10.3%) presented a wet type of lesion. One hundred and fifty-nine (71.3%) of 223 patients were confirmed positive for CL by the presence of the amastigote form of Leishmania by stained Giemsa smear, and 170 (76.2%) were positive according to the presence of the promastigote form of Leishmania by culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). PCR confirmed 203 (91.0%) positive cases. Genotyping of Leishmania spp. by RFLP analysis revealed that L. tropica was the most common species at all ages, and L. infantum was second under 20 yr of age. In summary, CL is endemic in the Nalut district, Libya; PCR was the most sensitive parasite diagnostic test, and L. tropica was the most common species.

Ejaz;Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in central Punjab and Azad Kashmir regions of Pakistan;Objective: To describe frequency and clinical spectrum of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis in two geographical regions of Pakistan. Patients and methods This case series was compiled at PAF Hospital Sargodha (January, 2003 to November, 2004) and CMH, Muzaffarabad (January, 2006 to July, 2008). All patients clinically and parasitologically diagnosed as leishmaniasis, having concomitant cutaneous as well as mucosal lesions (contiguous or non-contiguous) were included in the study. Various demographical features (age, sex, geographical origin) and clinical pattern (number, site, morphology) of the lesions were recorded in all cases. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis. Results: Out of 414 cases of tegumentary leishmaniasis, 10 (2.4%) had mucocutaneous disease. In central Punjab (Sargodha) it was 2 out of 148 (1.35%), while it was 8 out of 266 (3.0%) in northern part (Azad Kashmir) of the country. Age range was 2 years to 67 years (mean age = 28.72Â±4.47 years). There were 3 females and 7 males. 4 of them had solitary contiguous lesions affecting adjacent cutaneous and mucosal surfaces. Rest had more than one discrete lesion and two of them had two mucosal surfaces (nose and lip) involved. Seven patients were treated with weekly intralesional injections (maximum up to 16 weeks) and three received daily intramuscular injections of meglumine antimoniate (for 2 weeks). Most common morphological pattern was psoriasiform plaque. All patients responded well to treatment without any significant side effect. Conclusion: Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is a rarity but does exist in Pakistan. However, its clinical spectrum is entirely different from that of New World mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Lesions are characteristically benign and respond well to systemic as well as intralesional antimonials compound.

Microscopical examination of Giemsa-stained bone marrow (BM) smears show the presence of Leishmania spp. amastigotes based on their morphological characteristics. In spite of the parasitological finding, the serological test applied gave negative results. Molecular analyses confirmed the infection and allowed us to identify the leishmania species as Leishmania infantum (100% identity). VL/HIV coinfection has important clinical, diagnostic and epidemiological implications. In fact, the failure of serological tests is expected in this condition, and the application of molecular diagnostics to the blood may offer, apart from an easy and non-invasive diagnostic opportunity, the possibility of warning about the risk of possible nosocomial infections.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;10.2298/ABS1204271M;;;;1276;;;;;;;4;Archives of Biological Sciences;HIV co-infection,Molecular diagnosis,Visceral leishmaniosis;;Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;1271;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84867779018&doi=10.2298%2fABS1204271M&partnerID=40&md5=7352d213ea2f387ed278db9392faa9d0;64;2012;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Campino;Risk factors for canine leishmaniasis in an endemic Mediterranean region;"Human visceral leishmaniasis is an emergent/re-emergent parasitic zoonotic disease in Europe caused by Leishmania infantum, with domestic dog as its main reservoir host. This study presents the results of a canine epidemiological survey in a mediterranean region where human and canine leishmaniasis (CanL) are endemic - Portugal. The main goal was to identify risk factors, which can be relevant for Leishmania infection control. The national survey was carried out in January 2009 with a screening of 3974 dogs from all 18 districts of mainland Portugal. Direct Agglutination Test was used for the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies in canine blood. An overall CanL true prevalence of 6.31% was observed. Apparent prevalence at district level ranged from 0.88% to 16.16%, with the highest prevalence in the interior regions. Identified risk factors for positivity were: dogs of 2 years and older (adjusted odds ratio OR = 5.39); spending exclusively/most of the time outdoors (OR = 2.51); origin from the interior of Portugal in comparison to littoral/coast districts (OR = 2.51); not having long fur (OR = 2.03); and being pure exotic (OR = 1.67). The results confirm the leishmaniasis endemicity in Portugal and the dynamic character of prevalence as new foci emerged and old foci lost their importance. The dog's age, fur size, district and living outdoors as opposed to indoors were more important than dog breeds and insecticide treatment in the transmission of Leishmania infection. The future of CanL prevention and control rely on an integrated approach involving veterinarians, dog owners and health authorities in order to reduce the canine infection risk and consequently, the human zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis.

A venereal route of transmission has also been suggested, but this issue is still controversial. Findings. Here, we report a case of a dog affected by orchitis showing a clinical profile of L. infantum infection. By exploiting a real-time PCR assay, we detected a significantly higher DNA load of the parasite in the lymph node and testis than in blood and urine samples collected from the dog. Conclusions: Our results suggest that: 1) L. infantum infection can be associated with testicular lesions in naturally infected dogs; 2) genital involvement could result in shedding of the parasites in the semen, favoring venereal transmission of the disease.

Al-Jawabreh;Serological and molecular survey of Leishmania parasites in apparently healthy dogs in the West Bank, Palestine;"Background: Canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) is caused by Leishmania infantum in all Mediterranean countries. The Leishmania parasite is transmitted by the bite of a corresponding sand fly vector and primarily maintained in nature by wild and domestic reservoirs, including dogs, foxes and jackals. Infected dogs are the primary reservoir host in endemic regions and are the most significant risk disposing humans to infection. The present study aimed at assessing the prevalence of infection with Leishmania and identification of Leishmania infantum in domestic dogs in the West Bank, Palestine. Methods. The infection rate among domestic dogs collected from seven districts in the Palestinian West Bank was investigated by examination of parasites in culture from the buffy coat using serological and molecular methods; based on ELISA, internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) and cysteine protease (CPB) PCR. Results: Out of 215 dogs examined for Leishmania, 36 (16.7%) were positive in at least one method. Twenty three animals (11.5%) were positive for Leishmania DNA, whereas, ELISA and culture revealed 16 (7.5%), and 4 (1.5%) respectively. CPB-PCR on one of three culture-positive isolates revealed Leishmania infantum as the causative agent for Leishmania infection in dogs. Conclusions: Our study showed that canine leishmania infection is prevalent with varying degrees in all the seven studied districts in Palestine despite the absence of human VL cases in 4 of these districts. The causative agent was confirmed to be Leishmania infantum.

Diagnosis and species identification was done by applying internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) RFLP analysis to 47 isolates, of which 44 (93.6%) were . Leishmania tropica and 3 (6.4%) were . L. major. RFLP analysis was also performed on 256 skin tissue scrapings spotted onto filter papers, showing that 138 (53.9%) were positive, of which 50.7% were infected with . L. tropica, 17.4% with . L. major and 2.9% with . L. donovani s.l., and 29.0% could not be identified. This is the first report from Palestine on human CL caused by . L. infantum. Nine of the strains of . L. tropica were subjected to multilocus enzyme electrophoresis, six of which belonged to the zymodeme MON-137 and three to a new zymodeme (MON-307). This separation was corroborated by excreted factor serotyping. This observation modifies the classical epidemiological view of CL in Palestine. Jenin District is an active focus of CL caused by . L. tropica, where . Phlebotomus sergenti, the putative vector, is abundant. These data suggest that CL is a zoonotic infection, but an animal reservoir has not been found.

Recently asymptomatic infected dogs were regarded to be as important as clinically ill dogs. This study was aimed to determine the seroprevalence of L. infantum infection among asymptomatic dogs in the southwest and central parts of Iran and to investigate possible risk factors associated with this infection. 548 serum samples were collected from dogs in three Iranian provinces and subjected to direct agglutination test (DAT) in dilutions of 1:80 to 1:20480. Fifty three (9.67%) of the dogs had detectable anti- L. infantum antibodies at dilutions of â‰¥1:80. Living status of the dogs (household or free roaming) was a potential risk factor for the infection; seroprevalence was significantly higher in free roaming dogs (P<0.001). Dogs of more than 2-year-old had a significantly higher infection rate in comparison with younger dogs (P<0.001). No significant statistical differences were seen between seroprevalences of the male and female dogs. The results of this study show relatively high sero-prevalence of L. infantum infection in evaluated regions and higher seroprevalence in old and free roaming dogs, which shows the importance of environmental contamination and access of the dogs to the other reservoir hosts.";;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;;;;;57;;;;;;;1;Iranian Journal of Veterinary Research;Dogs,Iran,Leishmania infantum,Visceral leishmaniasis;;Cited By :6,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;54;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865386702&partnerID=40&md5=e5a53aafd53c05d5b80a6e0ca3449d7e;13;2012;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

In the present study, we describe the detection of L. braziliensis, L. infantum, and L. mexicana in serum of dogs from the states of Yucatan and Quintana Roo in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico). A total of 412 sera were analyzed by ELISA using the total extract of the parasite and the iron superoxide dismutase excreted by different trypanosomatids as antigens. We found the prevalence of L. braziliensis to be 7.52%, L. infantum to be 6.07%, and L. mexicana to be 20.63%, in the dog population studied. The results obtained with ELISA using iron superoxide dismutase as the antigen were confirmed by western blot analysis with its greater sensitivity, and the agreement between the two techniques was very high.

GÃ¡llego;Application of molecular techniques in the study of natural infection of Leishmania infantum vectors and utility of sandfly blood meal digestion for epidemiological surveys of leishmaniasis;"Epidemiological studies on the distribution of leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum Nicolle, 1908 (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) have been based principally on serological surveys of the canine reservoir. This methodology is useful due to the facility of sampling, the rapidity in obtaining results, its consistency and because it allows the detection of heterogeneous foci of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) even in small areas. Other investigations have analysed Leishmania parasitism in sandflies (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) by using classical dissection techniques. These techniques allow the vector species to be incriminated in different foci, although they suffer from being very time consuming. Lately, studies in this field are increasingly using molecular techniques, which are faster and easier to perform. In the present work, we applied a nested-PCR in a study of natural infection of sandflies by Leishmania in three isolated farms where serological data on canine leishmaniasis of local dogs were also obtained. The analysis allowed the detection of 38.7% of females with positive nested-PCR (78%, 18% and 0%, respectively, in the different isolated farms). The positive Leishmania DNA samples were genotyped and identified as L. infantum. The results of this work provide new data for the vectorial capacity of Phlebotomus ariasi in a Pyrenean area, which can be considered at risk of becoming a new focus of CanL. The females with positive nested-PCR displayed blood in the midgut at different degrees of digestion, and/or were gravid. According to the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk of nested-PCR-positivity increased significantly with the degree of blood digestion (OR=1.3; P value=0.025). The Phlebotomus species and the presence of eggs were not statistically associated with nested-PCR positivity (P value of >0.05). The correlation of positive nested- PCR results with the presence of seropositive dogs in the farm confirms the utility of this technique in the study of the distribution and intensity of leishmaniasis foci. Also, the importance of sandfly blood-meal digestion for epidemiological surveys of leishmaniasis foci has been demonstrated.

Berdjane-Brouk, R.N. Charrel, B. Hamrioui, A. Izri;First detection of Leishmania infantum DNA in Phlebotomus longicuspis Nitzulescu, 1930 from visceral leishmaniasis endemic focus in Algeria;Two clinico-epidemiological forms of leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum complex are endemic in Algeria: human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) and sporadic cutaneous leishmaniasis. In the northern part of the country, the Kabylian region is the main endemic HVL focus with more than 200 cases recorded annually. During the summer of 2009, an entomological study was performed in Larbaa Nath Irathen with the aim to identify the vectors of Leishmania and of phleboviruses. In the present paper, we report the results of the Leishmania vectors. In the field, female sand flies, which were alive at collection time, were morphologically identified and examined for the presence of promastigotes. The remaining sandflies (males and dead females) were carried to the laboratory for morphological identification and molecular analysis. Total DNA was extracted from each female sandfly, and ITS2 Leishmania was amplified by PCR. A total of 883 sandfly specimens were collected. Ten distinct species were morphologically identified: one species belonged to the Sergentomyia genus and nine to the Phlebotomus genus. L. infantum DNA was amplified in 1/169 (0.6%) dissected dead females, one Phlebotomus longicuspis. Our data support the Parrot's hypothesis raised in 1941 concerning the role of P. longicuspis in the transmission of L. infantum.

Amr;Stray dogs of northern Jordan as reservoirs of ticks and tick-borne hemopathogens;Dogs are competent reservoir hosts of several hemopathogens including zoonotic agents and can serve as readily available source of nutrition for many blood-feeding arthropods. Three hemopathogens had been detected for the first time in Jordan. The PCR prevalence of Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Hepatozoon canis, and piroplasmid DNA were 39.5%, 28.9%, and 7.9% (nâˆˆ=âˆˆ38) respectively. Sequencing of amplicons of PCR with universal primers targeting the 18S rRNA gene of piroplasmids shows the highest similarity to equine piroplasmids species Theileria equi from two dogs and Babesia caballi from a single dog. Ticks of two genera Rhipicephalus and Haemaphysalis, were detected in this study (nâˆˆ=âˆˆ268). The brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus was the most abundant species (95.1%, nâˆˆ=âˆˆ255), followed by Haemaphysalis erinacei (3%, nâˆˆ=âˆˆ8) and Haemaphysalis parva (1.9%, nâˆˆ=âˆˆ5). The two Haemaphysalis species were detected for the first time from dogs in Jordan. Regarding its high prevalence, we expect R. sanguineus being a possible vector of detected pathogens.

Farkas;First record of autochthonous canine leishmaniasis in Hungary;"Hungary is traditionally regarded as a leishmaniasis-free country, and human or canine cases diagnosed locally have been recorded as imported. However, recent entomological surveys have verified the presence in Hungary of Phlebotomus neglectus and Phlebotomus perfiliewi perfiliewi, which have been incriminated as competent vectors of Leishmania infantum elsewhere in Europe. Following the occurrence in October 2007 of an undisputable clinical case of L. infantum canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in a 4-year-old female pug in a kennel of 20 dogs in Tolna province, an investigation was performed to assess the infection status in that canine population and to search for putative phlebotomine vectors. Another female pug became sick during the study period (May-November 2008) and L. infantum was confirmed as the causative agent. The other animals appeared clinically healthy; however, 4 additional dogs were found positive by indirect fluorescent antibody test (2 dogs), or by buffy-coat PCR (1 dog), or by both methods (1 dog). Hence the overall Leishmania infection prevalence in the kennel was 30% (6/20). All dogs were born in the same place and had been always kept outdoors. They had neither been abroad nor received a blood transfusion. No sand flies were collected with CDC Standard Miniature Light traps, Mosquito MagnetÂ® X (MMX) dry ice-baited traps, or sticky traps placed either in or around the kennel and at nearby chicken yards during July and August of 2008 and 2009. Considering the dogs' historical background and the failure to trap any sand fly vectors in the kennel area, the origin of CanL in this site remains unexplained.

The chi-square test revealed that there was a significant relationship between the symptoms and dogs that were positive for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The parasitological investigation showed concordance of 66.7% with PCR on blood and 84.1% with PCR on lymph node aspirate. In addition to these tests, evaluations of the diagnoses in parallel and in series were conducted, which showed concordances with the parasitological test of 76.2% and 74.6%, respectively.

Cardoso;Tongue nodules in canine leishmaniosis a case report;"Background: Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) caused by Leishmania infantum is an endemic zoonosis in southern European countries. Infected dogs can present rare or atypical forms of the disease and diagnosis can be challenging. The present report describes a case of tongue nodules in a 3-year-old neutered female Labrador Retriever dog with leishmaniosis. Findings: A fine needle aspiration of the lingual nodules revealed amastigote forms of Leishmania inside macrophages. Differential diagnosis ruled out neoplasia, calcinosis circumscripta, solar glossitis, vasculitis, amyloidosis, eosinophilic granulomas, chemical and electrical burns, uremic glossitis and autoimmune diseases. Combined therapy with antimoniate meglumine and allopurinol for 30 days resulted in the normalization of hematological and biochemical parameters. Two months after diagnosis and the beginning of treatment, a mild inflammatory infiltrate was observed by histopathology, but an anti-Leishmania immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) was negative as well as a PCR on both tongue lesions and a bone marrow aspirate. Seven months after diagnosis, the dogs general condition appeared good, there were no tongue lesions and a new IFAT was negative. Fifteen months after diagnosis this clinically favourable outcome continued. Conclusions: The dog could have suffered a relapsing episode of CanL, but a new systemic or local infection cannot be excluded. Regular clinical re-evaluation should be maintained, as a future relapse can potentially occur. In conclusion, CanL should be considered in the differential diagnosis of nodular glossitis in dogs.

Falqueto;The effect of removing potentially infectious dogs on the numbers of canine Leishmania infantum infections in an endemic area with high transmission rates;To assess the effect of the rapid removal of potentially infectious dogs on the prevalence and incidence of canine infections, a prospective study was undertaken in an area endemic for Leishmania infantum. We used serological testing based on the rapid DPP rK28 fusion protein chromatographic immunoassay for this dog screening-and-culling intervention trial. The outcome was evaluated by measuring seropositivity and sero-conversion/-reversion rates for canine infection. Our estimates indicated that concomitant detection and elimination of seropositive dogs with active disease may affect the numbers of canine infections and disease burden temporarily, although it is insufficient as a measure to interrupt the zoonotic L. infantum transmission. However, most of the asymptomatic, seropositive dogs continuously exhibit low levels of antibodies and/or reverted, remaining seronegative thereafter. In the process of waiting for an effective vaccine, one option for canine reservoir control may be to identify these possibly genetically resistant animals and promote their expansion in the population.

In this study, the regional prevalence of canine seropositivity to . Leishmania spp. in Greek mainland was simultaneously assessed in 7 different regions. A total of 2620 serum samples were collected from clinically healthy dogs and were tested for anti-. L. infantum antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A high degree of agreement (. Îº=. 0.96) was observed between these two tests. The seroprevalence rate in the whole study population was nearly 20%, being highest among dogs living in Attiki (30.12%) and lowest for those living in Florina (2.05%). There was no difference in terms of the gender of the dogs, their length of hair coat or their utility; on the contrary, seroprevalence rates were significantly higher among dogs in the age groups of 1-3 years (23.39%) and 3-9 years (23.35%) than in younger (2.26%) or older (6.03%) dogs. Epidemiological data on the seroprevalence of canine leishmaniasis provide indirect information on the prevalence of the infection and the disease and are necessary to implement and then to evaluate the effectiveness of control measures.

Lakshmikantan, S. Shivaji;Molecular characterization of Hepatozoon spp. infection in endangered Indian wild felids and canids;Hepatozoon species are parasites that infect a wide variety of domestic and wild animals. The objective of this study was to perform the molecular detection and characterization of Hepatozoon spp. in Asiatic lion, Indian tiger, Indian leopard, Indian wild dog, Indian domestic dog and cat based on partial 18S rRNA gene sequences from Hepatozoon spp. in the naturally infected animals. Hepatozoon spp. could be detected in blood samples of 5 out of 9 Asiatic lions, 2 out of 5 Indian tigers, 2 out of 4 Indian leopards and 2 out of 2 Indian wild dogs and, 2 out of 4 domestic cats and 2 out of 3 domestic dog samples by PCR. Sequencing of PCR amplicon and BLAST analysis of partial 18S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the Hepatozoon spp. in Asiatic lion, Bengal tiger, Indian leopard and domestic cat was Hepatozoon felis (98-99% similarity) and in the Indian wild and domestic dog the phylogenetic neighbour was Hepatozoon canis (97-100% similarity). Presence of H. felis and H. canis in both domestic and wild animals suggested that they are not host specific and the same parasite causes infection in domestic and wild felids and canids in India and from different parts of the world. To our knowledge, this is the first report on detection and molecular characterization of H. felis infection in Asiatic lions, Indian tigers, Indian leopards and H. canis in Indian wild dog. Hepatozoon spp. may be a potential pathogen and an opportunistic parasite in immuno-compromised animals and could thus represent a threat to endangered Indian wild felids and canids.

Trotta;Detection of Leishmania infantum DNA mainly in Rhipicephalus sanguineus male ticks removed from dogs living in endemic areas of canine leishmaniosis;"Background: Sand flies are the only biologically adapted vectors of Leishmania parasites, however, a possible role in the transmission of Leishmania has been proposed for other hematophagous ectoparasites such as ticks. In order to evaluate natural infection by Leishmania infantum in Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks, taking into account its close association with dogs, 128 adult R. sanguineus ticks removed from 41 dogs living in endemic areas of canine leishmaniosis were studied. Methods. Individual DNA extraction was performed from each tick and whole blood taken from dogs. Dog sera were tested for IgG antibodies to L. infantum antigen by ELISA and L. infantum real-time PCR was performed from canine whole blood samples and ticks. Results: Leishmania infantum PCR was positive in 13 ticks (10.1%) including one female, (2.0%) and 12 males (15.2%), and in only five dogs (12.2%). Male ticks had a significantly higher infection rate when compared to female R. sanguineus. The percentage of L. infantum seroreactive dogs was 19.5%. All but two PCR positive dogs were seroreactive. Leishmania infantum PCR positive ticks were removed from seropositive and seronegative dogs with a variety of PCR results. Conclusions: This study demonstrates high prevalence of L. infantum DNA in R. sanguineus ticks removed from L. infantum seropositive and seronegative dogs. The presence of L. infantum DNA was detected mainly in male ticks possibly due to their ability to move between canine hosts and feed on several canine hosts during the adult life stage. Additional studies are needed to further explore the role of R. sanguineus ticks and in particular, male adults, in both the epidemiology and immunology of L. infantum infection in dogs in endemic areas.

Naucke, S. Lorentz;First report of venereal and vertical transmission of canine leishmaniosis from naturally infected dogs in Germany;"Background: Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) is a zoonotic disease caused by Leishmania (L.) infantum. It is endemic to several tropical and subtropical countries but also to the Mediterranean region. It is transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies but occasional non-vector transmissions have been reported, including vertical and horizontal transmission. Findings. The authors report a case of CanL in a female boxer dog from Dusseldorf, Germany, that had never been in an endemic region. A serum sample from the bitch was tested positive for antibodies against Leishmania (IFAT 1:2,000, ELISA 72). The bitch had whelped three litters, and one puppy from the third litter was also found to be seropositive for Leishmania antibodies (IFAT 1:4,000, ELISA 78). Conclusions: Up to now, despite intensive searching, the occurrence of sandflies could not be proved in the bitch's region of origin. Thus, vertical and horizontal transmission are to be discussed as possible ways of infection. This may be the first report of venereal and vertical transmission of L. infantum in naturally infected dogs in Germany.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of three species of the Leishmania genus and possible associated factors in sera of 218 dogs from two different populations in MÃ©rida, YucatÃ¡n (Mexico). The sera were analyzed to detect antibodies against L. mexicana, L. braziliensis, and L. infantum using the superoxide dismutase- enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (SOD-ELISA) and Western blot as confirmation. The Fe-SOD excreted was used as the antigenic fraction for the three Leishmania species. The prevalence values found were 30.2% (. L. mexicana), 8.2% (. L. braziliensis), and 11.9% (. L. infantum). , with L. mexicana seroprevalence being greater than L. braziliensis and L. infantum (p. <. 0.05). Five percent (11/218) of the dogs showed antibodies against L. mexicana/L. braziliensis, 5.5% (12/218) with L. mexicana/L. infantum and 1.8% (4/218) with L. mexicana/L. braziliensis/L. infantum. No relationship (p. >. 0.05. ) was found between antibodies against L. mexicana and breed, age, physical condition, or cutaneous lesions in dogs. This study provides evidence of antibodies against L. mexicana, L. braziliensis and L. infantum in dog populations from MÃ©rida, Mexico.

Current situation of Leishmania infantum infection in shelter dogs in northern Spain Parasites and Vectors, 5(1),  #Pages#; G. MirÃ¡, R. Checa, A. Montoya, L. HernÃ¡ndez, D. Dado, R. GÃ¡lvez;Current situation of Leishmania infantum infection in shelter dogs in northern Spain;"Background: Canine leishmaniosis (CanL) caused by Leishmania infantum is a widespread endemic disease in the Mediterranean basin, though, so far, the north of Spain has been considered a non-endemic area. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of specific antibodies to L. infantum among stray dogs living in shelters in this area, and to evaluate the clinical status (both clinical signs and clinico-pathological abnormalities) of seropositive dogs. Besides L. infantum infection, the epidemiological role of variables like sex, breed and age was also assessed. Methods. Over the year 2011 a cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 418 stray dogs. A preliminary entomological survey was carried out using CDC-light traps. The chi-squared test was used to examine relationships between L. infantum seroprevalence and the remaining variables. Results: The overall seroprevalence of L. infantum infection detected was 3% in the Cantabrian coast. In Orense the seroprevalence was 35.6%. In this latter region, the presence of sand fly, Phlebotomus perniciosus was also detected. In general, seropositivity for L. infantum was related to size (large breed dogs versus small) and age, with a significantly higher seroprevalence recorded in younger (0-3 years) and older dogs (> 7 years) than adult dogs. Clinical signs of CanL were observed in 41.3% of the seropositive dogs. The seropositivity for L. infantum infection associated with the presence of clinical signs and/or abnormal laboratory findings shows a prevalence of 4.5%. Conclusion: Our data provide new insight into the prevalence of CanL across northern Spain. The situation observed in Orense seems to be worsening compared to the few reports available, with figures being similar to those cited for known endemic areas of Spain. Besides, the presence of P. perniciosus in Orense points out to a risk of the spread of this zoonotic disease in this geographical area. These findings identify a need for an active search for the sand fly vectors of L. infantum across the entire northern spanish region including the rest of Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria and the Basque Country.

Many CVBD-agents are of zoonotic concern, with dogs potentially serving as reservoirs and sentinels for human infections. The present study aimed at assessing the seroprevalence of infection with or exposure to Dirofilaria immitis, Ehrlichia canis, Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, Anaplasma spp. and Leishmania infantum in dogs in Portugal. Methods. Based on 120 veterinary medical centres from all the regions of mainland and insular Portugal, 557 apparently healthy and 628 CVBD-suspect dogs were sampled. Serum, plasma or whole blood was tested for qualitative detection of D. immitis antigen and antibodies to E. canis, B. burgdorferi s. l., Anaplasma spp. and L. infantum with two commercial in-clinic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated by logistic regression analysis to identify independent risk factors of exposure to the vector-borne agents. Results: Total positivity levels to D. immitis, E. canis, B. burgdorferi, Anaplasma spp., L. infantum, one or more agents and mixed agents were 3.6%, 4.1%, 0.2%, 4.5%, 4.3%, 14.0% and 2.0% in the healthy group, and 8.9%, 16.4%, 0.5%, 9.2%, 25.2%, 46.3% and 11.6% in the clinically suspect group, respectively. Non-use of ectoparasiticides was a risk factor for positivity to one or more agents both in the apparently healthy (OR = 2.1) and CVBD-suspect (OR = 1.5) dogs. Seropositivity to L. infantum (OR = 7.6), E. canis (OR = 4.1) and D. immitis (OR = 2.4) were identified as risk factors for the presence of clinical signs compatible with CVBDs. Positivity to mixed agents was not found to be a risk factor for disease. Conclusions: Dogs in Portugal are at risk of becoming infected with vector-borne pathogens, some of which are of zoonotic concern. CVBDs should be considered by practitioners and prophylactic measures must be put in place to protect dogs and limit the risk of transmission of vector-borne agents to humans. This study is expected to give veterinary and public health authorities an increased awareness about CVBDs in Portugal and to serve as a reference for future investigations and control actions.

Tselentis;Re-emergence of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Greek Island of Crete;"Leishmaniases are vector-borne diseases transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. Three species of Leishmania are found in the Mediterranean basin: Leishmania infantum, the most common species responsible for both visceral (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL); Leishmania major, found in North Africa and Middle East causing CL; Leishmania tropica with a limited presence in Europe, causing CL. During the last 25 years, Crete has become an endemic zone for L. infantum with a high number of infected dogs and an increasing number of human cases every year; in the last 4 years, the incidence has reached an average of seven VL patients per year in a population of 600,000. At the same time, CL has re-emerged in Crete due to L. tropica, with an average of three CL cases per year in the last 4 years. Isolates were typed as L. infantum MON-1 and MON-98 and L. tropica MON-300, a zymodeme not reported before. Both VL and CL have spread to the whole of the island during the last 25 years, primarily in semi-urban and urban areas with altitudes of 0-50 m. The prevailing Phlebotomus species were Phlebotomus neglectus (proven vector of L. infantum) and Phlebotomus similis (suspected vector of L. tropica).

Otranto;Hepatozoon canis infection in ticks during spring and summer in Italy;Hepatozoon canis is a common protozoan of dogs, being among the most prevalent tick-borne pathogens infecting dogs around the world. It is primarily transmitted by Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the brown dog tick. In this study we tested ticks collected from dogs and from the environment in order to track the origin of an outbreak of H. canis infection detected in October 2009 in a private dog shelter in southern Italy. Ticks from dogs (n=267) were collected during the spring of 2009, whereas ticks from environment (n=300) were found on sticky traps placed in the same shelter during the summer of 2009. All ticks were tested by PCR for the detection of a H. canis 18S ribosomal RNA gene fragment. Four (1.5%, one female and three males) ticks collected from dogs were PCR positive. None of the larvae collected from the environment were positive, but a relatively high infection rate (8.0%) was detected in nymphs. These findings point out that dogs became infected during the summer, when ticks were abundant and highly infected by H. canis. Moreover, this study suggests that castor oil sticky traps might be useful to collect engorged immature ticks in highly infested environments (e.g., dog shelters). This might be particularly interesting to evaluate the level of infection by certain pathogens in free-ranging ticks R. sanguineus, as done in the present study.

Tinucci-Costa;Molecular characterization of Hepatozoon canis in dogs from Colombia;Hepatozoonosis is a tick-borne disease whose transmission to dogs occurs by ingestion of oocysts infected ticks or feeding on preys infested by infected ticks. Until now, there is no previous report of molecular characterization of Hepatozoon sp. in dogs from Colombia. EDTA blood samples were collected from 91 dogs from centralwestern region of Colombia (BogotÃ¡, Bucaramanga, and Villavicencio cities) and submitted to 18S rRNA Hepatozoon sp. PCR and blood smears confection. Phylogenetic analysis was used to access the identity of Hepatozoon species found in sampled dogs. From 91 sampled dogs, 29 (31.8%) were positive to Hepatozoon sp. (25 dogs were only positive in PCR, 1 was positive only in blood smears, and 3 were positive in both blood smears and PCR). After sequencing, the found Hepatozoon sp. DNA showed 100% of identity with Hepatozoon canis DNA isolates. The phylogenetic tree supported the identity of the found Hepatozoon sp. DNA, showing that the isolates from Colombia were placed in the same clade than other H. canis isolates from Venezuela, Spain, and Taiwan. This is the first molecular detection of H. canis in dogs from Colombia.

Motazedian, Q. Asgari, M. Kalantari;Asymptomatic domestic dogs are carriers of Leishmania infantum: Possible reservoirs host for human visceral leishmaniasis in southern Iran;In the past few years, the incidence of human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) has increased in many districts of Fars Province, southwest of Iran, particularly, among communities of nomadic tribes. Recent epidemiological reports in Leishmania infantum endemic regions of Iran indicate that more than 50-70% of seropositive dogs are asymptomatic for Leishmania infection. Between 2004 and 2006, blood samples were collected from 110 domestic dogs from nomadic and rural areas. Each of these samples was tested for anti-Leishmania antibodies, in direct agglutination tests (DATs), and for L. infantum kinetoplast deoxyribonucleic acid (kDNA), in polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays. Of the 110 dogs, 5. 5% (6/110) were found seropositive and 23% (25/110) PCR-positive. Four of the six seropositive (67%) and 22 of the 25 PCR-positive (88%) were asymptomatic. The rate of infection in dogs from nomadic communities was higher (27%) than dogs from rural areas (18%). Since positivity in the PCR-based assay indicated the presence of L. infantum amastigotes in the peripheral blood of 23% of the subjects, it is clear that these asymptomatic dogs (88%) are quite common in the study areas and probably act as reservoirs in the transmission of Leishmania parasites, to humans and to other dogs, by sandflies. Moreover, our study showed that application of PCR to buffy coat samples gave a better estimate of the real rate of infection in asymptomatic dogs than DAT.

Clinical aspects, epidemiologic profiles, and risk factors are described. Most cases were in children â‰¤ 5 years of age, the prevalence of seropositive persons was 77%. The main risk factors associated with this disease were having 1-3 rooms in a house compared with â‰¥ 4 rooms, having a roof that was not made of cement, and having domestic animals. In contrast, only 19% of dogs were seropositive, suggesting that this species is not important in the transmission cycle of Leishmania.

This study aimed to determine the present status of Leishmania infantum infection among humans and domestic dogs using serological and molecular methods in central parts of Mazandaran Province. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, blood samples were randomly collected from 402 humans and fortynine domestic dogs throughout 2009 and 2010 in the central part of Mazandaran Province including Semeskadeh and Kiakola districts where recent cases of human visceral leishmaniasis had been reported there. All the collected samples were tested by direct agglutination test (DAT) for the detection of anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies as well as convenience PCR assay on whole blood samples for detection of leishmanial infection and identification of Leishmania species. Results: None of 402 collected human (402) and dog (49) blood samples showed anti Leishmania infantum antibodies at titers 1:3200 and 1:320 as cut-off values of DAT, respectively but only 2 of domestic dogs (4.1%) were found PCR-positive corresponding to L.infantum. Conclusion: This study confirms the circulation of L. infantum at least among domestic dogs and highlights the sporadic pattern of VL in the studied areas.

Clinical findings, hematological parameters, parasitological, and molecular diagnosis and treatments were evaluated. On physical examination, this animal showed apathy, anorexia, pale mucosal, nasal and eye secretion, coughing, fever, and progressive weight loss. Gamonts of H. canis were observed within neutrophils in thin blood smears. Important hematological findings observed in this case consisted of severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis. A partial sequence of the 18S rRNA gene amplified and sequenced from the dog blood was 100% identical to H. canis. The animal was treated with imidocarb dipropionate, which had great curative efficacy to clinical hepatozoonosis.

Charehdar;Neospora caninum and Leishmania infantum Co-infection in domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) in Meshkin-Shahr District, northwestern Iran;Background: Mediterranean visceral leishmaniasis (MVL) is an infectious disease that affects both human and animals. Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are principal reservoir hosts of MVL caused by Leishmania infantum. Dogs are definitive hosts for Neospora caninum and a risk factor for infecting intermediate hosts. The immunosuppression caused by visceral leishmaniasis (VL) can promote the occurrence of co-infections with other agents such as neosporosis. This study aimed to determine the frequency of co-infection of the both protozoan parasites in the endemic areas of VL from Meshkin-Shahr District, north-west of Iran. Methods: Altogether, 171 serum samples were collected from domestic dogs of Meshkin- Shahr District by multistage cluster sampling from October 2008 to August 2009. The collected serum samples were tested for the detection of simultaneous infection of L. infantum and N. caninum using direct agglutination test (DAT) and indirect ELISA, respectively. Results: Of the 171 domestic dogs, 27 (15.8%) and 52 (30.4%) were showed antibodies against L. infantum and N. caninum, respectively. Simultaneous infections of N. caninum and L. infantum was found in 16 (9.4%) of the dogs. In VL-positive and VL-negative dogs, N. caninum infection was found in 59.3% and 25.0%, respectively. A statistically significant difference was found between VL-positive and VL-negative dogs with N. caninum infection (P= 0.001). Conclusion: These findings indicate that Meshkin-Shahr District in northwestern Iran is an active focus of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). Neospora caninum and L. infantum co-infection is prevalent in the area and infection by L. infantum seems to enhance susceptibility to N. caninum infection in domestic dogs.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;;;;;68;;;;;;;2;Iranian Journal of Arthropod-Borne Diseases;Co-infection,Dog,Iran,Leishmania infantum,Neospora caninum,Seroepidemiology;;Cited By :8,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;60;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84861906918&partnerID=40&md5=bc6c99210e2618395ebdfde712477986;5;2011;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Daraselia, M.P. Fay, S. Kamhawi, D. Sacks;Epidemiologic aspects of an emerging focus of visceral leishmaniasis in tbilisi, georgia;"Background: Over the last 15 years, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has emerged as a public health concern in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia. Methodology/Principal Findings: Seroepidemiological surveys were conducted to determine the prevalence and incidence of infection in children and dogs within the main focus of VL, and to identify risk factors associated with human infection. Of 4,250 children investigated, 7.3% were positive by direct agglutination test in a baseline survey; an apparent incidence rate of 6.0% was estimated by one year follow-up. None of the seropositive children progressed to VL during the survey. Increased seropositivity at one year was predicted by presence at baseline of clustered flying insects (OR = 1.49; P = 0.001), perceived satisfactory sanitation (OR = 1.65; P&0.001), stray dogs (OR = 1.33; P = 0.023), and by persistent fever during the 6 months prior to baseline survey (OR = 14.2; P&0.001). Overall, 18.2% (107/588) of domestic and 15.3% (110/718) of stray dogs were seropositive by the rk39 dipstick test. Clinical VL signs were found in 1.3% of domestic and 2.9% of stray, seropositive dogs. Parasites isolated from human and dog samples were identified by PCR and phylogenetic analysis of the Leishmania 70 kDa heat-shock protein (HSP70) gene as Leishmania infantum. Conclusions/Significance: There is an active focus of L. infantum transmission in Tbilisi with a high prevalence of human and canine infections.

Domestic dogs and small forest mammals are reservoir hosts for L. (Leishmania) infantum. However, the role that these animals play in the transmission cycle of the Leishmania spp. that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis is not well known. This study evaluated 72 rodents, 25 marsupials and 98 domestic dogs found in two villages of the XakriabÃ¡ Indigenous Territory, an area of intense ATL transmission. A total of 23 dogs (23.47%) were shown to be positive according to at least one test; 8 dogs (8.16%) tested positive in a single serological test and 15 dogs (15.31%) tested positive by IFAT and ELISA. Eleven dogs were euthanised to allow for molecular diagnosis, of which nine (81.8%) tested positive by PCR for Leishmania in at least one tissue. Seven animals were infected only with L. (L.) infantum, whilst two displayed a mixed infection of L. (L.) infantum and L. (V.) braziliensis. Isoenzymatic characterisation identified L. (L.) infantum parasites isolated from the bone marrow of two dogs. Of the 97 small mammals captured, 24 tested positive for Leishmania by PCR. The results showed that L. (V.) braziliensis, L. (L.) infantum and L. (V.) guyanensis are circulating among wild and synanthropic mammals present in the XakriabÃ¡ Reserve, highlighting the epidemiological diversity of ATL in this region.

To identify the vector(s), an investigation was carried out in Bilesavar District, one of the important foci of the disease in Ardebil Province in northwestern Iran, during July-September 2008. Methods: Using sticky papers, 2,110 sand flies were collected from indoors (bedroom, guestroom, toilet and stable) and outdoors (wall cracks, crevices and animal burrows) and identified morphologically. Species-specific amplification of promastigotes revealed specific PCR products of L. infantum DNA. Results: Six sand fly species were found in the district, including: Phlebotomus perfiliewi transcaucasicus, P. papatasi, P. tobbi, P. sergenti, Sergentomyia dentata and S. sintoni. Phlebotomus perfiliewi transcaucasicus was the dominant species of the genus Phlebotomus (62.8%).

A study of natural infection in wild rabbits, humans and dogs in southeastern Spain;An epidemiological study was carried out to investigate asymptomatic Leishmania infantum infection by PCR and ELISA in wild rabbits, humans and domestic dogs in southeastern Spain. Seroprevalence was 0% (0/36) in rabbits, 2% (13/657) in humans and 7% (14/208) in dogs. The prevalence of PCR-positives was 0.6% (1/162) in rabbits tested in a wide range of tissue samples, 2% (8/392) in humans analysed in blood samples and 10% (20/193) and 67% (29/43) in dogs analysed in blood and lymphoid tissue samples, respectively. Results suggest that wild rabbits have a very low risk of becoming chronically infected with L. infantum, and provide further evidence that cryptic L. infantum infection is widespread in the domestic dog population and is also present in a comparatively smaller proportion of healthy humans. The epidemiological and clinical implications of these findings are discussed.

Trisciuoglio, N. Negre, E. Ferroglio;An Investigation into Alternative Reservoirs of Canine Leishmaniasis on the Endemic Island of Mallorca (Spain);The role of wild and free-roaming domestic carnivores as a reservoir of Leishmania infantum was investigated on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca (Balearic Islands, Spain), an endemic area for this disease. Serum, blood and/or spleen samples from 169 animals [48 dogs from a kennel, 86 wild-caught feral cats, 23 pine martens (Martes martes), 10 common genets (Genetta genetta) and two weasels (Mustela nivalis)] were analysed. Seroprevalence determined by Western blotting was 38% in dogs and 16% in feral cats, while the prevalence of infection determined by PCR was 44% in dogs, 26% in cats, 39% in pine martens and 10% in genets. This is the first report of infection by L. infantum in the pine marten or any other member of the Mustelidae family. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis found 33 different patterns in 23 dogs, 14 cats and three martens. Two patterns were shared by dogs and cats, two by different cats, and one by different dogs. Patterns were different to those previously reported in carnivores from peninsular Spain. No external lesions compatible with leishmaniasis were observed in any species other than the dogs. Although the dog is probably the primary reservoir of leishmaniasis in endemic areas, the prevalence and the absence of apparent signs of this disease within the island's abundant feral cat and pine marten populations could make these species potential primary or secondary hosts of L. infantum in Mallorca.

Galati, F. Canavez, V.L. Pereira-Chioccola;Detection of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum RNA in fleas and ticks collected from naturally infected dogs;The occurrence of the insect vector (sand flies) with low rates of Leishmania infection, as well as autochthonous transmission in the absence of the natural vector in dogs, have been reported. These unexpected data suggest a hypothesis of other arthropods as a possible way of Leishmania transmission. The prevalence of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum in fleas and ticks collected from dogs with canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL), as well as parasite viability, were evaluated herein. The presence of L. (L.) infantum was assayed by PCR and ELISA in ectoparasites and biological samples from 73 dogs living in a Brazilian endemic area. As the occurrence of Leishmania DNA in ticks and fleas is expected given their blood-feeding habits, we next investigated whether parasites can remain viable inside ticks. PCR and ELISA confirmed that 83% of the dogs had CVL. Fleas and ticks (nymphs, male and female adults) were collected in 55% and 63% of the 73 dogs, respectively. Out of the 60 dogs with CVL, 80% harbored ectoparasites infected with L. (L.) infantum. The infection rates of the ectoparasites were 23% and 50% for fleas and ticks, respectively. The RNA analysis of the extract from ticks left in laboratory conditions during 7 to 10 days after removal from CVL dogs showed that parasites were alive. In addition, live parasites were also detected inside adult ticks recently molted in laboratory conditions. These findings indicate a higher infection rate of L. (L.) infantum in ticks and fleas, but they do not conclusively demonstrate whether these ticks can act as vectors of CVL, despite the fact that their rates were higher than those previously described in Lutzomyia longipalpis. The presence of viable L. (L.) infantum in ticks suggests the possible importance of dog ectoparasites in CVL dissemination.

Carneiro;Prevalence and factors associated with Leishmania infantum infection of dogs from an urban area of Brazil as identified by molecular methods;"Background: Various factors contribute to the urbanization of the visceral leishmaniasis (VL), including the difficulties of implementing control measures relating to the domestic reservoir. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis in an urban endemic area in Brazil and the factors associated with Leishmania infantum infection among seronegative and PCR-positive dogs. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 1,443 dogs. Serology was carried out by using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Biomanguinhos/FIOCRUZ/RJ and ""in house""), and molecular methods were developed, including PCR-RFLP. To identify the factors associated with early stages of infection, only seronegative (n = 1,213) animals were evaluated. These animals were divided into two groups: PCR-positive (n = 296) and PCR-negative (n = 917) for L. infantum DNA. A comparison of these two groups of dogs taking into consideration the characteristics of the animals and their owners was performed. A mixed logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with L. infantum infection. Principal Findings: Of the 1,443 dogs examined, 230 (15.9%) were seropositive in at least one ELISA, whereas PCR-RFLP revealed that 356 animals (24.7%) were positive for L. infantum DNA. Results indicated that the associated factors with infection were family income<twice the Brazilian minimum salary (OR 2.3; 95%CI 1.4-3.8), knowledge of the owner regarding the vector (OR 1.9; 95%CI 1.1-3.4), the dog staying predominantly in the backyard (OR 2.2; 95%CI 1.1-4.1), and a lack of previous serological examination for VL (OR 1.5; 95%CI 1.1-2.3). Conclusions: PCR detected a high prevalence of L. infantum infection in dogs in an area under the Control Program of VL intervention. Socioeconomic variables, dog behavior and the knowledge of the owner regarding the vector were factors associated with canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). The absence of previous serological examination conducted by the control program was also associated with L. infantum infection. It is necessary to identify the risk factors associated with CVL to understand the expansion and urbanization of VL.

Coleman, M. Gatne, R.J. Traub;A survey of canine tick-borne diseases in India;"Background: There are few published reports on canine Babesia, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Hepatozoon and haemotropic Mycoplasma infections in India and most describe clinical disease in individual dogs, diagnosed by morphological observation of the microorganisms in stained blood smears. This study investigated the occurrence and distribution of canine tick-borne disease (TBD) pathogens using a combination of conventional and molecular diagnostic techniques in four cities in India. Results: On microscopy examination, only Hepatozoon gamonts were observed in twelve out of 525 (2.3%; 95% CI: 1.2, 4) blood smears. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a total of 261 from 525 dogs (49.7%; 95% CI: 45.4, 54.1) in this study were infected with one or more canine tick-borne pathogen. Hepatozoon canis (30%; 95% CI: 26.0, 34.0) was the most common TBD pathogen found infecting dogs in India followed by Ehrlichia canis (20.6%; 95% CI: 17.2, 24.3), Mycoplasma haemocanis (12.2%; 95% CI: 9.5, 15.3), Anaplasma platys (6.5%; 95% CI: 4.5, 8.9), Babesia vogeli (5.5%, 95% CI: 3.7, 7.8) and Babesia gibsoni (0.2%, 95% CI: 0.01, 1.06). Concurrent infection with more than one TBD pathogen occurred in 39% of cases. Potential tick vectors, Rhipicephalus (most commonly) and/or Haemaphysalis ticks were found on 278 (53%) of dogs examined. Conclusions: At least 6 species of canine tick-borne pathogens are present in India. Hepatozoon canis was the most common pathogen and ticks belonging to the genus Rhipicephalus were encountered most frequently. Polymerase chain reaction was more sensitive in detecting circulating pathogens compared with peripheral blood smear examination. As co-infections with canine TBD pathogens were common, Indian veterinary practitioners should be cognisant that the discovery of one such pathogen raises the potential for multiple infections which may warrant different clinical management strategies.

Maroli, J. Dereure, P.D. Ready;First surveys to investigate the presence of canine leishmaniasis and its phlebotomine vectors in Hungary;Hungary is regarded as free of leishmaniasis because only a few imported cases have been reported. However, southern Hungary has a sub-Mediterranean climate, and so it was included in the EU FP6 EDEN project, which aimed to map the northern limits of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in Europe. The numbers of traveling and imported dogs have increased in the last decade, raising concerns about the introduction of CanL caused by Leishmania infantum. Serum samples were collected from 725 dogs (22 localities, 6 counties) that had never traveled to endemic countries, as well as from other potential reservoir hosts (185 red foxes and 13 golden jackals). All sera were tested by the indirect fluorescent antibody test, but they were sero-negative using the OIE cut-off of 1:80 serum dilution except for those of two dogs resident since birth in southern Hungary. These had not received a blood transfusion, but the mode of transmission is unclear because no sandfly vectors were caught locally. From 2006 to 2009, phlebotomine sandflies were sampled in the summer months at 47 localities of 8 counties. They were trapped with castor-oil-impregnated sticky-paper, light, and CO2-baited traps. Small numbers of two vectors of Leishmania infantum were found. Phlebotomus neglectus occurred in three villages near to Croatia and one in north Hungary at latitude 47N, and Phlebotomus perfiliewi perfiliewi was trapped at two sites in a southeastern county close to the sites where it was first found in 1931-1932. Our report provides baseline data for future investigations into the northward spread of CanL into Hungary, which we conclude has yet to occur.

Marty, L. Pratlong, F. Faraut, C. Mary, R. Piarroux, J.-P. Dedet, F. Pratlong;Mucosal Leishmania infantum leishmaniasis: Specific pattern in a multicentre survey and historical cases;Objective: Leishmania infantum mucosally restricted leishmaniasis was rarely reported, so that diagnostic and treatment strategies remain debated. A long-term multicentric survey appeared thereby necessary. Methods: Cases were prospectively collected over 12 years in 3 academic hospitals of Southern France. Predisposing factors, clinical findings, diagnostic procedures, treatment and outcome were compared to medical literature. Results: Ten new cases and 40 historical reports were collected. Respectively 10/10 and 35/40 patients were adult males. Immunodeficiency was frequent (5/10 and 18/40). No previous cutaneous lesion was reported. Leishmaniasis affected mostly larynx (5/10 and 19/40), but also mouth (2/10 and 19/40) and nose (3/10 and 5/40). Lesions were highly polymorph. Mucosa histological examination provided respectively 1/10 and 2/40 false negative results, contrary to serum immunoblotting and PCR on mucosal biopsy. Although local response was always satisfactory even using topical treatment, subsequent visceral spreading was observed in 2/10 and 1/40 cases. Conclusion: L. infantum mucosally restricted leishmaniasis exhibits a specific pattern, marked by tropism for adult males, high clinical and histological polymorphism. Immunoblot screening and PCR confirmation of suspected lesions are necessary because of direct examination occasional false negative results. The risk of visceral spreading sustains systemic therapy. Summary: Leishmania infantum mucosal leishmaniasis mostly affects adult males, half of them immunodeficient. Clinical and histological polymorphism makes the diagnosis difficult, stressing the need for immunoblot screening and mucosa PCR analysis of suspected cases. Possible visceralization sustains systemic therapy.

Nahhas, K. Knio, N. Nuwayri-Salti;Detection of Leishmania parasites in the blood of patients with isolated cutaneous leishmaniasis;"Background: The consequences of the spread of Leishmania parasites to the blood from lesions in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis are numerous. To assess the magnitude of this invasion we conducted the present study on patients referred to the American University of Beirut Medical Center for cutaneous leishmaniasis. Methods: Patients referred for the management of cutaneous leishmaniasis were included in the study. Skin and blood cultures for Leishmania were taken from these patients. Results: One hundred sixty-two patients were proven to have cutaneous leishmaniasis by pathology; 52% were males and 44% females (gender information was missing for 4%). Patient age ranged from 5 months to 70 years. None of the patients had received treatment for Leishmania. We obtained parasite isolates from 85 patients (52.5%), proven by cultures from skin and blood/blood components. Interestingly, the parasite was isolated in the blood and blood components of 50 patients (30.9%). Isoenzyme analysis confirmed the fact that the organisms in blood and skin were the same; from the 28 isolates that were positive in both skin and blood, eight isolates were Leishmania major and two were Leishmania tropica. The remaining isolates, whether positive in both blood and skin or in either of these tissues, skin or blood and its products, were Leishmania infantum sensu lato. Conclusions: In the current study, the detection rate of parasites in the blood of patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis was high. This illustrates the invasive characteristic of the parasite that has escaped the skin. Testing should be considered in areas other than Lebanon, especially around the Mediterranean basin. Whether these findings support the administration of systemic treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis or not needs to be confirmed in larger prospective studies.

Poglayen;Canine leishmaniasis surveillance in a northern Italy kennel;An epidemiological survey on canine leishmaniasis (CanL) was performed during a 3-year period (2007-2009) in a public kennel of the Bologna province. The presence of the disease was shown in the canine population for the first time in 2007 by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). The parasite circulation was confirmed also by direct diagnostic tools, as PCR, cytology and cultural method, performed on different bioptic materials. The parasite was isolated and identified as Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON 1. The serological monitoring was performed also in 2008 and 2009 on animals that previously showed negative or uncertain results. The incidence values calculated by significant seroconversions in IFAT titre â‰¥1/160, ranged between 4.9% and 6.6%, indicating a stable focus of leishmaniasis. The entomological survey, performed by sticky and CO 2-baited traps in 2008, showed the presence of the vector Phlebotomus perfiliewi. This study allowed us to identify a stable focus of CanL in an area that was not considered eco-compatible with the presence of the vector and infection. Our results confirm the northward spread of CanL towards areas not previously affected by autochthonous foci.

Gaye;Seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum in a rural area of Senegal: Analysis of risk factors involved in transmission to humans;"Whereas Leishmania infantum, the agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), is well known in North Africa, very limited data exist on its spread in West Africa, where mainly cutaneous leishmaniasis has been widely reported. Nevertheless, dogs infected with L. infantum were recently found in the Mont Rolland District in Senegal. To provide a better understanding of L. infantum epidemiology in this area, clinical and serological surveys were carried out to determine the seroprevalence of L. infantum-specific antibodies in the human population. In parallel, an analysis of environmental and individual factors associated with Leishmania antigen seropositivity was conducted to identify potential risk factors for exposure. Although no cases of VL were detected within this study, a large part of the population (73/315; 23%) was exposed to infection, with a strong age effect (being >40. years old increased the risk of being seropositive). Moreover, the presence of Nebedaye trees (Moringa oleifera) and infected dogs in the household were factors increasing the risk of exposure in household members. These results may provide important information to identify the still unknown sandfly species involved in transmission.

Yang, H.-T. Chen;The prevalence of canine Leishmania infantum infection in western China detected by PCR and serological tests;"Background: Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) is endemic in western China, resulting in important public health problem. It is essential to evaluate the prevalence of canine Leishmania infantum infection for designing control policy. In the present study we report for the first time prevalence of Leishmania infection in dogs living in Jiuzhaigou County (Sichuan Provence, China), which is not only an important endemic area of CanL but also a tourism scenic spot, detected by PCR, ELISA and dipstick test. The results could provide key information for designing control programs against canine and human leishmaniasis. In addition, the complete sequence of the Leishmania isolate from Sichuan Province has not been reported to date and we present the sequences of 116 base-pair (bp) fragment of the conserved region in the minicircle kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) and the results of phylogenetic analyses based on the sequence of the amplified fragment. Results: The proportion of dogs infected with Leishmania in Jiuzhaigou County was 36.79%, 9.43%, and 51.88% detected by ELISA, dipstick test, and PCR, respectively. The ELISA and PCR tests were more sensitive than dipstick test. The PCR method is the most sensitive way to detect dogs infected with Leishmania parasites. The total positive rate for infected dogs in the area was 59.43% by the three methods. The PCR products of 116-bp fragment amplified from the kDNA conserved region of dog blood samples and laboratory maintained L. infantum were DNA sequenced and the variation of the sequences was observed. The phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of 116-bp fragment reveals that L. infantum is more genetically related to visceralizing species L. donovani than to the Leishmania species associated with cutaneous disease. Conclusions: More than half of dogs living in the endemic Jiuzhaigou County were infected by L. infantum. Control measures, such as treatment or eradication of infected dogs, or prohibition of maintaining dogs, must be taken against these infected dogs due to their role in the transmission of the infection to vectors. The phylogenetic tree based on the sequences of conserved region in kDNA of Leishmania can effectively distinguish species of Leishmania.

Baneth;Canine leishmaniosis and its relationship to human visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern Uzbekistan;"Background: The Namangan Region in the Pap District, located in Eastern Uzbekistan is the main focus of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Uzbekistan. In total, 28 cases of human VL were registered during 2006-2008 in this region. A study on the epidemiology of VL in this area was carried out in 2007-2008 in the villages of Chodak, Oltinkan, Gulistan and Chorkesar located at elevations of 900-1200 above sea level. Results: A total of 162 dogs were tested for Leishmania infection. Blood was drawn for serology and PCR. When clinical signs of the disease were present, aspirates from lymph nodes and the spleen were taken. Forty-two dogs (25.9%) had clinical signs suggestive of VL and 51 (31.5%) were sero-positive. ITS-1 PCR was performed for 135 dogs using blood and tissue samples and 40 (29.6%) of them were PCR-positive. Leishmanial parasites were cultured from lymph node or spleen aspirates from 10 dogs. Eight Leishmania strains isolated from dogs were typed by multi-locus microsatellite typing (MLMT) and by multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis (MLEE), using a 15 enzyme system. These analyses revealed that the strains belong to the most common zymodeme of L. infantum, i.e., MON-1, and form a unique group when compared to MON-1 strains from other geographical regions. Conclusions: The data obtained through this study confirm the existence of an active focus of VL in the Namangan region of Uzbekistan. The fact that L. infantum was the causative agent of canine infection with typical clinical signs, and also of human infection affecting only infants, suggests that a zoonotic form of VL similar in epidemiology to Mediterranean VL is present in Uzbekistan.

In addition, blood samples were collected from 30 domestic dogs from the same areas. All the collected blood samples were tested by direct agglutination test (DAT) for the detection of anti-Leishmania antibodies in both human and dog using the cut-off value of â‰¥1:3200 and â‰¥ 1:320, respectively. Parasitological, molecular, and pathological were performed on infected dogs. Chi-square and Fisher exact tests were used to compare sero-prevalence values. Results: From 1476 collected human serum samples, 23 (1.55%) showed anti-Leishmania antibodies at titers of 1:800 and 1:1600 whereas 14 (0.95%) showed anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies at titers of â‰¥ 1:3200. No statistically significant difference was found between male (1.18%) and female (0.69%) sero-prevalence (P=0.330). Children of 5-8 years showed the highest sero-prevalence rate (3.22%). Seven out of 30 domestic dogs (23%) showed anti-Leishmania antibodies at titers â‰¥1:320. Leishmania infantum was identified in five infected dogs by nested - PCR assay. Conclusion: It seems that visceral leishmaniasis is being endemic in southern villages of Baft district, southeast of Iran.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;;;;;11;;;;;;;1;Iranian Journal of Parasitology;Direct agglutination test,Human,Iran,Sero-epidemiology,Visceral leishmaniasis,adult,agglutination test,antibody detection,antibody titer,article,blood sampling,child,dog,endemic disease,epidemic,female,human,Iran,Leishmania infantum,male,nonhuman,polymerase chain reaction,seroprevalence,visceral leishmaniasis,Canis familiaris,Leishmania infantum,Naso hexacanthus;;Cited By :17,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79953006706&partnerID=40&md5=a6b57b3209c63297049186eaf31935f4;6;2011;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Solano-Gallego;A serological and molecular study of leishmania infantum infection in cats from the island of Ibiza (Spain);The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of Leishmania infantum infection within a feline population by serologic and molecular methods and to identify associated risk factors. One hundred five cats living outdoors were studied. Sera were tested for IgG antibodies against L. infantum, Toxoplasma gondii, and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and for the detection of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) p27 antigen by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). L. infantum real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on DNA extracted from blood. L. infantum and T. gondii seroprevalence rates were 13.2% and 55.2%, respectively. The prevalence of L. infantum by PCR was 8.7%. The total rate of L. infantum infection derived from seroreactivity and/or positive PCR was 15.4%. Serology and PCR results were positively associated, and moderate agreement (kappa=0.489) was found between Leishmania ELISA and PCR. No statistical association was found between positive Leishmania PCR results and gender, clinical status, or T. gondii seropositivity. Six of the 105 cats (5.7%) displayed clinical signs compatible with feline cutaneous leishmaniosis, and 4 out of these 6 cats (66.7%) were found to have Leishmania infection by means of serology and/or PCR. Leishmania seropositivity was associated with clinical signs of feline cutaneous leishmaniosis (p=0.029). The prevalence of FeLV p27 antigen was 16.2% (17/105) and of FIV antibody was 20.9% (22/105), with coinfection found in 9.5% (10/105) of the cats. Leishmania ELISA seroreactivity and positive PCR results were statistically associated with FeLV infection and with coinfection of both retroviruses but not with a positive FIV status. The high seroprevalence and molecular rates of Leishmania infection observed indicate that cats are frequently infected with L. infantum, and the association with FeLV suggests a potential role for this retrovirus in feline Leishmania infection in endemic areas.

This study aimed to determine current distribution of visceral leishmaniasis in four distinct geographical zones of Iran. A cross-sectional study was conducted using direct agglutination test (DAT) on 9396 and 2559 serum samples collected from humans and domestic dogs, respectively during the period of 2007 through 2009. Altogether, 403 (4.3%) out of 9396 human serum samples collected from 4 distinct geographical locations showed anti-Leishmania antibodies with titers â‰¥1:3200. Physical examinations performed on 142 sero-positive cases with anti-Leishmania antibodies at titers of 1: 3200 to 1:102400 among whom fever (94.4%), paleness (67.6%) and hepato-splenomegaly (42.2%) were the predominant clinical signs and symptoms. The highest sero-prevalence rate (1.55%) was found in children â‰¤5 years old. Out of 2559 serum samples collected from domestic dogs, 212 (8.3%) were DAT positive (â‰¥1:320). Leishmania infantum is the principal causative agent of the disease was isolated from both infected humans and dogs in Iran. Our findings indicate that Mediterranean visceral leishmaniasis with different distribution occurs in different geographical locations of Iran. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of our study is to determine the seroprevalence of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in owned dogs of the Sarab area and to identify the species of Leishmania isolated from these dogs. We also compared the sensitivities and specificities of two polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays (kDNA and ITS1) used for Leishmania infantum identification with culture, microscopic detection and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods as well as validate the PCR techniques for the molecular diagnosis of CVL. Sera from 384 dogs of 30 villages around Sarab, were tested by ELISA and buffy coat blood fractions after sampling tested with PCR by specific primers (kDNA, ITS-18sRNA). Thirty-five dogs were seropositive by ELISA. The seroprevalence rate (SPR) of CVL was 9.1% (CI, 95% 6.6 -12.4). The most important serological result was a high proportion of seropositivity for leishmaniasis. Out of 361 (94%) asymptomatic dogs, 31 (8.6%) were seropositive, and out of 23 (6%) symptomatic dogs, 4 (17.4%) were seropositive. Agreement between the ELISA test and clinical signs was 86.7%. Each assay was performed on 60 blood samples. PCR of kDNA (7/60 positives, 11.8%) was the most sensitive of the assays examined, followed by ELISA (3/60, 5%) and ITS1-PCR (2/60, 3.4 %). All diagnostic assays were highly specific (100 %) and had positive predictive values (PPV) >90% and negative predictive values (NPV) >88% for CVL. As expected, kDNAPCR proved to be the most sensitive (87.5 %) assay for leishmanial DNA in peripheral blood. This study shows that kDNA-PCR is significantly more sensitive than the other parasitological and serological methods, allowing the identification of infected dogs even before the appearance of serum L. infantum antibodies. Because kDNA-PCR is the most reliable, sensitive, and also a rapid diagnostic assay for CVL, it should be employed as the new standard for routine diagnosis.

Canines are the main reservoirs of VL in most of the endemic areas. Different serological methods have been introduced for diagnosis of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). Objective: In this survey a Fucose-Mannose Ligand (FML) ELISA, using native L. infantum antigen, was developed and its validity for detection of infected dogs in comparison with direct agglutination test (DAT) and PCR was evaluated. Methods: Blood samples of sixty ownership dogs (â‰¤ 3 years old) were collected from Meshkin-shahr district in Ardabil province, North-west of Iran. Sera were separated for serological assays (DAT and FMLELISA) and the buffy coats were collected for molecular evaluation. Results: Two out of the 60 (3.33%) samples were found to be positive (antibody titer of â‰¥ 1/320) in DAT while seven of the 60 (11.66%) samples were positive by FML-ELISA. Nine out of 60 (15%) buffy coat samples showed a band about 680 bp indicative of L. infantum in PCR. Three out of 60 dogs had Kala-azar symptoms and were positive by PCR and FML-ELISA, while two of these three dogs had antibody titers >1/320 in their serum samples. The sensitivity and specificity of FML-ELISA for the detection of CVL in both symptomatic and asymptomatic dogs were found to be 77.8% and 100%, respectively. Conclusion: Considering the acceptable sensitivity and high specificity of FMLELISA, use of this serological method can be recommended for epidemiological surveys of CVL.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;;;;;250;;;;;;;4;Iranian Journal of Immunology;Canine,DAT,ELISA,Iran,PCR,Visceral leishmaniasis,fucose,mannose,agglutination test,antibody titer,antigen detection,article,cachexia,controlled study,dog,endemic disease,enzyme linked immunosorbent assay,Iran,Leishmania infantum,nonhuman,polymerase chain reaction,sensitivity and specificity,serology,validity,visceral leishmaniasis,Animals,Antigens, Protozoan,Coombs Test,Disease Reservoirs,Dog Diseases,Dogs,Endemic Diseases,Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,Feasibility Studies,Iran,Lectins,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Sensitivity and Specificity;;Cited By :3,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;244;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84856441504&partnerID=40&md5=fdbe67bb7a05e1e3752555e683c594d9;8;2011;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Campino;Feline Leishmania infection in a canine leishmaniasis endemic region, Portugal;Canine leishmaniasis (CanL) caused by Leishmania infantum is a serious zoonotic public health and veterinary problem in the Mediterranean basin. Leishmania infection in domestic cats (Felis catus domesticus) has been reported in several countries where this zoonosis is endemic, such as Portugal, Spain, Italy, France, Greece, Israel, Palestine and Brazil. The aim of this study was to contribute to the knowledge of the role played by cats in Leishmania epidemiology, in an endemic focus of zoonotic leishmaniasis, the Lisbon metropolitan area, Portugal. L. infantum DNA was detected in peripheral blood of 28 out of 138 cats (20.3%). The result of PCR in blood of cats was not closely associated with the level of specific circulating antibodies in their sera. Positive serology was observed only in one cat out of 76. In the same geographic region and time period the indirect immunofluorescent test revealed 20.4% (31/152) of dogs with antibodies and PCR detected Leismania DNA on 34.9% (53/152) animals. Despite the fact that specific antibodies have been validated for diagnosis of CanL, their detection does not seem to be sensitive enough to predict Leishmania infection in cats. On the other hand, the presence of parasite DNA in cat's peripheral blood during the transmission season and out of the season suggests that these animals living in endemic areas are frequently exposed or infected with the parasite. Although dogs have been universally regarded as the major domestic/peridomestic reservoir hosts, the present data allow us to hypothesize that cats can act as an alternative reservoir host of L. infantum, rather than an accidental host. However, in order to evaluate the existence of a transmission cycle with cats sustaining and spreading zoonotic leishmaniasis is necessary to prove that these animals can transmit the parasite to the vector in nature.

Gaye;Canine visceral leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum in Senegal: Risk of emergence in humans?;In the context of global warming and the risk of spreading arthropod-borne diseases, the emergence and reemergence of leishmaniasis should not be neglected. In Senegal, over the past few years, cases of canine leishmaniasis have been observed. We aim to improve the understanding of the transmission cycle of this zoonosis, to determine the responsible species and to evaluate the risk for human health. An epidemiological and serological study on canine and human populations in the community of Mont Rolland (ThiÃ¨s area) was conducted. The data showed a high seroprevalence of canine leishmaniasis (>40%) and more than 30% seropositive people. The dogs' seroprevalence was confirmed by PCR data (concordance > 0.85, Kappa > 0.7). The statistical analysis showed strong statistical associations between the health status of dogs and seropositivity, the number of positive PCRs, clinical signs and the number of Leishmania isolates. For the first time, the discriminative PCRs performed on canine Leishmania strains clearly evidenced that the pathogenic agent is Leishmania infantum. The results obtained show that transmission of this species is well established in this area. That the high incidence of seropositivity in humans may be a consequence of infection with this species is discussed.

Saraiva, J.D.A. Filho, S. de Oliveira Silva, A.S.R. de Andrade, M.N. Melo;The molecular detection of different Leishmania species within sand flies from a cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis sympatric area in Southeastern Brazil;Over the last 20 years, there has been an increase in the number of leishmaniasis cases in Brazil. Belo Horizonte (BH) is one of the most highly populated Brazilian cities that is affected by visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The health services in BH are coordinated by a central nucleus that is subdivided into nine sanitary districts. Historically, the highest level of human VL cases was found in the northeast sanitary district (NSD). The objective of our study was to detect Leishmania infection in the phlebotomine sand flies collected in the NSD by dissection and molecular approaches. Following the occurrence of human VL cases in 2005, entomological captures were performed from July 2006-June 2007. Out of the 245 sand flies dissected, only three Lutzomyia longipalpis spp contained flagellates. The female sand flies were grouped into 120 pools according to date, collection site and species, with approximately 10 individual sand flies in each pool. Subsquently, the DNA was extracted and Leishmania spp and other parasites were detected and identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorfism. Leishmania infantum was present in at least 19% of the Lu. longipalpis collected, in 3.8% of the Nyssomiya whitmani collected, in 33.3% of the Evandromiya termitophila collected and in 14.3% of the Nyssomiya intermedia collected. When the females of the cortelezzii complex were compared with each other, 3.2% of the females were infected with Leishmania braziliensis, whereas 3.2% of the females were infected with trypanosomatids.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;;;;;1039;;;;;;;8;Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz;Belo Horizonte,Leishmania spp,Natural infection,Sand flies,protozoal DNA,animal,article,Brazil,classification,disease carrier,disease transmission,female,genetics,isolation and purification,Leishmania,parasitology,polymerase chain reaction,Psychodidae,restriction fragment length polymorphism,skin leishmaniasis,visceral leishmaniasis,Animals,Brazil,DNA, Protozoan,Female,Insect Vectors,Leishmania,Leishmaniasis, Cutaneous,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length,Psychodidae,Kinetoplastida,Leishmania braziliensis,Leishmania infantum,Lutzomyia longipalpis,Mastigophora (flagellates),Phlebotominae,Trypanosomatidae;;Cited By :24,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;1033;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650805280&partnerID=40&md5=2ba35d7d47d26a797068976aa6dd4bfc;105;2010;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Clinical Findings-Physical examination revealed muscle wasting, lymphadenopathy, and multifocal pruritic dermatologic lesions of alopecia, thickening, erythema, and follicular casting. Hematologic and serum biochemical analyses revealed nonregenerative anemia, monocytosis, hypercalcemia, hyperproteinemia, and hyperglobulinemia. Proteinuria was identified on urinalysis. Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and diffuse abdominal lymphadenomegaly were detected on abdominal ultrasonography. A diagnosis of leishmaniasis was confirmed by ELISA detection of serum antibodies against Leishmania spp, a high serum indirect fluorescent antibody titer (1:1,024) against Leishmania infantum, amplification of Leishmania DNA on PCR assay of a whole blood sample and a lymph node aspirate, and histologic identification of suspected Leishmania amastigotes in skin specimens. In addition, the dog had a low CD4+:CD8+ lymphocyte ratio of 1:1. Treatment and Outcome-The dog was euthanized because of the severity of leishmaniasis and poor prognosis. This dog was from a litter of 10 puppies that included 4 stillborn puppies, 2 puppies that died as neonates, and 1 littermate that was euthanized at 1 year of age because of a high serum antibody titer against Leishmania spp. Eventually the foxhound dam was euthanized because of a high serum antibody titer against Leishmania spp. The dog had been raised with an unaffected littermate, its sire, and an unrelated Treeing Walker Coonhound female that were seronegative for Leishmania infection. Clinical Relevance-Although vertical disease transmission was suspected, it is possible that L infantum is now endemic in Colorado. Leishmaniasis should be considered in dogs with scaly dermatoses.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;10.2460/javma.237.11.1288;;;;1291;;;;;;;11;Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association;protozoon antibody,animal,animal disease,article,blood,dog,dog disease,female,isolation and purification,Leishmania infantum,male,parasitology,United States,vertical transmission,visceral leishmaniasis,Animals,Antibodies, Protozoan,Colorado,Dog Diseases,Dogs,Female,Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Male,Animalia,Canis familiaris,Leishmania infantum;;Cited By :7,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;1288;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78650119280&doi=10.2460%2fjavma.237.11.1288&partnerID=40&md5=f71a609afe07ed8c202b7c5ce26cd2be;237;2010;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Bornay-Llinares;A canine leishmaniasis pilot survey in an emerging focus of visceral leishmaniasis: Posadas (Misiones, Argentina);"Background: An increasing number of reports are calling our attention to the worldwide spread of leishmaniasis. The urbanization of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has been observed in different South American countries, due to changes in demographic and ecological factors. In May 2006, VL was detected for the first time in the city of Posadas (Misiones, Argentina). This event encouraged us to conduct a clinical and parasitological pilot survey on domestic dogs from Posadas to identify their potential role as reservoirs for the disease.Methods: One hundred and ten dogs from the city of Posadas were included in the study. They were selected based on convenience and availability. All dogs underwent clinical examination. Symptomatology related to canine leishmaniasis was recorded, and peripheral blood and lymph node aspirates were collected. Anti-Leishmania antibodies were detected using rK39-immunocromatographic tests and IFAT. Parasite detection was based on peripheral blood and lymph node aspirate PCR targeting the SSUrRNA gene. Molecular typing was addressed by DNA sequence analysis of the PCR products obtained by SSUrRNA and ITS-1 PCR.Results: According to clinical examination, 69.1% (76/110) of the dogs presented symptoms compatible with canine leishmaniasis. Serological analyses were positive for 43.6% (48/110) of the dogs and parasite DNA was detected in 47.3% (52/110). A total of 63 dogs (57.3%) were positive by serology and/or PCR. Molecular typing identified Leishmania infantum (syn. Leishmania chagasi) as the causative agent.Conclusions: This work confirms recent findings which revealed the presence of Lutzomyia longipalpis, the vector of L. infantum in this area of South America. This new VL focus could be well established, and further work is needed to ascertain its magnitude and to prevent further human VL cases.

Michalick;First report of infection of Lutzomyia longipalpis by Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum from a naturally infected cat of Brazil;In recent years, cases of feline visceral leishmaniasis (FVL) have been described in different countries. In urban areas, domestic cats are suggested as possible alternative reservoirs of Leishmania (L.) infantum, the causal agent of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). This paper reports the first case of infection of Lutzomyia longipalpis by L. infantum of a naturally infected cat from Brazil through xenodiagnosis. The presence of a cat with FVL and its infectivity to the natural vector in Belo Horizonte city, an endemic area of VL in Brazil, suggests the need for further studies to determine the rate of occurrence of FVL among domestic cats and the infectivity ratio of L. longipalpis in endemic areas, and what is the role of these animals in the epidemiology of the disease.

Low seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum infection in cats from northern Portugal based on DAT and ELISA Veterinary Parasitology, 174(1-2),  37; L. Cardoso, A.P. Lopes, K. Sherry, H. Schallig, L. Solano-Gallego;Low seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum infection in cats from northern Portugal based on DAT and ELISA;"Cats have been considered playing a role in the epidemiology of leishmaniosis caused by Leishmania infantum, an endemic zoonosis in countries of the Mediterranean basin. The present study assessed the prevalence of antibodies to L. infantum in 316 domestic cats from northern Portugal, by means of the direct agglutination test (DAT) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Seroreactivity to DAT was found in six cats, and nine cats were positive in the ELISA, including the six DAT-positive animals. The overall seroprevalence of Leishmania infection was 2.8%, based on ELISA and DAT. A substantial agreement (99%; Îº value. =0.80) was found between DAT and ELISA results. The difference between seroprevalence values in females (0.7%) and males (4.7%) was statistically significant (p=0.045). The age of seropositive cats ranged from 31 to 84 months. Cats with 5-6 years (60-71 months) and 6-7 years (72-83 months) presented the highest level of seropositivity (15.4% and 33.3%, respectively). A significant difference was found comparing the seroprevalences in cats aged less than 24 months (0.0%) and in those with 24 months or more (7.3%) (p=0.022). Seroprevalences in cats living in a rural environment (10.5%) or in urban areas (0.0%) were also found to be significantly different (p<. 0.001). No significant differences were detected between serological status to Leishmania in pure non-European and European or mixed breeds (p=0.442), cats that lived totally indoors and those that had access to outdoors (p=0.412), cats seropositive and seronegative to Toxoplasma gondii (p=0.276), or apparently healthy animals and those with clinical illness (p=0.271). This study is the largest epidemiological investigation performed on feline Leishmania infection in Portugal. The seroprevalence of Leishmania infection was low in cats living in northern Portugal, a region where canine leishmaniosis is endemic. Nevertheless, Leishmania infection must not be underestimated and leishmaniosis may be included in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous or systemic clinical signs in cats.

AlmerÃ­a;Kennel dogs as sentinels of Leishmania infantum, Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum in Majorca Island, Spain;Kennel dogs can serve as sentinels and/or reservoirs of diseases of veterinary and zoonotic interest because they have often roamed free and lived outdoors, thus being exposed to pathogens. We tested dogs from the kennel of Inca (Majorca/Mallorca, Balearic Islands, Spain) for evidence of infection with three protozoan parasites: Leishmania infantum, Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum. Exposure to L. infantum was found in 56.3% of 48 dogs (37.5% by Western blot, 43.8% by PCR). Only 30% of infected dogs had leishmaniosis-like lesions. Seroprevalence to T. gondii was 58.7% of 46 dogs using the modified agglutination test (MAT, titer 1:25). None of the 44 dogs tested had N. caninum antibodies using a commercial competitive ELISA, probably because the surveyed dogs did not roam in the proximity of cattle farms. Results confirm the endemicity of L. infantum and also the widespread presence of T. gondii in the Mediterranean island of Majorca.

Cancrini;The first report of hepatozoon canis identified in vulpes vulpes and Ticks from Italy;"This is the first report on the presence of Hepatozoon canis in Vulpes vulpes in Italy. During the years 2005 and 2006, a total of 119 foxes were collected and their spleen tissues were screened by microscopy, polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing. In the same area, 290 ticks were picked off from dogs or collected from the environment. Microscopy detected inclusion bodies regarded as belonging to the genus Hepatozoon in four samples, whereas molecular diagnostics evidenced 16 foxes (13.4%) and 6 ticks (2.1%) positive to H. canis. The H. canis isolates we found in foxes, compared with the strains we previously detected in dogs from the same area and with the strains found in foxes from other European countries, show a certain genetic heterogeneity. In fact, seven isolates cluster with the Italian dog strain and nine isolates cluster with the fox strain found in Spain and Slovakia; moreover, the dog's strain is closely related to one tick's isolate, and the strain found in three Rhipicephalus sanguineus and in one Ixodes ricinus collected from the environment cluster with the aforementioned Spanish and Slovak fox strains. Our findings confirm the importance of R. sanguineus as final host and suggest that I. ricinus might also be implicated in parasite transmission, explaining in that way the occurrence of hepatozoonosis in areas considered R. sanguineus-free. The peridomestic habits of V. vulpes and the increasing global temperature are expected to amplify the impact of this vector-borne disease and to enforce the transmission of Hepatozoon to domestic animals.

The SNAP 4DX detects Dirofilaria immitis (Di) antigen and antibodies against Ehrlichia canis (Ec), Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), and Anaplasma phagocytophylum (Aph); the SNAP Leishmania kit detects antibodies against Leishmania infantum (Li). Dogs were classified as healthy or sick based on physical examination, complete blood counts, and serum chemistry profiles. The prevalence of positive test results was as follows: Ec, 5.3% (n=7); Aph, 19.0% (n=25); Bb, 0%; Di, 0%; and Li, 5.3% (n=7). Four dogs (3%) were coexposed to Ec and Aph, and three dogs (2.3%) were coexposed to Aph and Li. There was no statistically significant correlation between positive serology and clinical status (sick vs. healthy) or hematologic/biochemical abnormalities. The prevalence of Aph was the highest and is in agreement with a recent report in a dog shelter in northwestern Spain. These point-of-care assays may be more valuable as epidemiologic than as clinical tools.

Between January-February of 2009, CDC light traps were used to collect insect samples from 13 capture sites in the municipality of Posadas, which is located in the province of Misiones of Argentina. Sand flies identified as Lutzomyia longipalpis were grouped into 28 separate pools for molecular biological analysis. Canine samples were taken from lymph node aspirates of two symptomatic stray animals that had been positively diagnosed with canine visceral leishmaniasis. One vector pool of 10 sand flies (1 out of the 28 pools tested) and both of the canine samples tested positively for Leishmania infantum by PCR and RFLP analysis. PCR products were confirmed by sequencing and showed a maximum identity with L. infantum. Given that infection was detected in one out of the 28 pools and that at least one infected insect was infected, it was possible to infer an infection rate at least of 0.47% for Lu. longipalpis among the analyzed samples. These results contribute to incriminate Lu. longipalpis as the vector of L. infantum in the municipality of Posadas, where cases of the disease in humans and dogs have been reported since 2005.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:45;;;;;799;;;;;;;6;Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz;Argentina,Leishmania infantum,Lutzomyia longipalpis,Visceral leishmaniasis,protozoal DNA,animal,animal disease,Argentina,article,disease carrier,disease transmission,dog,dog disease,genotype,isolation and purification,Leishmania infantum,parasitology,polymerase chain reaction,Psychodidae,restriction fragment length polymorphism,visceral leishmaniasis,Animals,Argentina,DNA, Protozoan,Dog Diseases,Dogs,Genotype,Insect Vectors,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length,Psychodidae,Animalia,Canis familiaris,Diptera,Hexapoda,Leishmania infantum,Lutzomyia longipalpis,Phlebotominae,Psychodidae;;Cited By :18,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;796;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77957975025&partnerID=40&md5=628ce5fe7070c6cab6d13f7565373209;105;2010;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Zhou;An outbreak of the desert sub-type of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis in Jiashi, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, People's Republic of China;Few outbreaks of the desert sub-type of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis (VL) have been described worldwide. In 2008, the incidence rate of VL in Jiashi County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the western part of the People's Republic of China, increased more than twenty-folds compared to the average annual incidence rate. The majority of the cases (96.6%) occurred among <2 year-old infants. For the first time in the desert area of Xinjiang, the parasites were isolated from bone marrow aspirates, using the NNN medium culture approach. The genetic analysis of the ITS-1 nucleotide sequence indicated that three isolates from eastern Jiashi County were genetically closely related and belonged to the Leishmania infantum group. However, they differed from an isolate from Kashi city which was classified as a member of the Leishmania donovani group.

Berriatua;Geographical variation and factors associated to seroprevalence of canine leishmaniosis in an endemic mediterranean area;"This article retrospectively analyses the spatial distribution and dog- and environmental-level risk factors associated to Leishmania infantum seroprevalence among 807 asymptomatic dogs in the Municipality of Crevillente in Alicante in southeast Spain in 1999. They represented 60% of the dogs in this 103 km2 area, with a human census of 27 034 people and 90% lived in Crevillente town. The estimated seroprevalence (95% confidence interval) in 714 dogs â‰¥1-year old was 22% (19-25) however; it was 12% (8-15) in town dogs and 0-100% in other administrative zones. High-medium seroprevalence zone clustered along a northeast-southwest fringe and around the town. They comprised the highest and driest inhabited part of the municipality, where farmland was interspersed by residential detached houses, whilst null-low seroprevalence zones included larger farmland extensions and two small rural villages. Predominant vegetation and ground soil type were bush, non-irrigated fruit trees and conglomerate crust and sandstone in medium-high seroprevalence zones and irrigated grassland and fruit trees and colluvial deposits in null-low seroprevalence zones. Random effects logistic regression indicated that the prevalence of infection with L. infantum was higher for dogs sharing residence with infected dogs, increased until 5-6 years old and with body weight and was associated to increasing conglomerate crust and low surface water in the dog's zone of residence. The study confirms that L. infantum infection is endemic in this part of Spain and shows that prevalence can vary significantly within a small area depending on specific demographic and environmental factors conditioning the habitat of the local L. infantum vector, Phlebotomus perniciosus. It suggests similar low-scale variability is present in other geographically variable endemic areas and should be investigated to design Leishmaniosis risk maps and cost-effective, evidence-based, targeted control interventions.

The main objective was to investigate the potential threat of stray cats for animal and public health. Samples of blood, stool, hair and auricular swabs were collected from 231 cats in 27 colonies. Anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were detected in 47/194 samples (24.2%); anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies in 1/180 cats (0.6%); intestinal parasites in 23/74 samples (Toxocara cati, Isospora felis, Ancylostoma tubaeforme, Dipylidium caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Toxascaris leonina) and Otodectes cynotis in 4/182 cats (2.2%); dermatophyte fungi were isolated in 40/136 samples (29.4%); feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies were detected in 23/226 samples (10.2%); feline leukaemia virus antigen in 14/198 samples (7.1%); and feline coronavirus RNA in 9/127 samples (7.1%). Our results revealed that zoonotic agents, namely dermatophyte fungi and Toxocara cati were present in stray cat colonies in the investigated counties. Overall the low frequency of major pathogens suggests a balanced relationship between host and agents.

BrandÃ£o-Filho;Cutaneous and visceral leishmaniosis in dogs from a rural community in northeastern Brazil;A community-based epidemiological study was carried out in a rural area in northeastern Brazil, where visceral leishmaniosis is endemic, but the primary vector Lutzomyia longipalpis has never been found. Forty-one dogs were screened by an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) for the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies and 12 (29.3%) of them were positive. One of the IFAT-positive dogs was also positive for Leishmania amastigotes in bone marrow cytology and for Leishmania infantum by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on blood. One IFAT-negative dog was positive for L. infantum by PCR on bone marrow and other for Leishmania amastigotes in skin stained-smears. When tested for L. braziliensis by PCR, 20 dogs were positive. Considering all diagnostic tests, the estimated prevalence of Leishmania spp. infection in the studied rural dog population was 58.5%. There was no significant difference in IFAT-positivity in relation to age, gender, and clinical status of the dogs. When tested for L. infantum by real-time PCR, 20 ticks collected from IFAT-positive dogs were all negative. This study shows a high level of exposure to Leishmania spp. infection in dogs from a rural community in northeastern Brazil. In general, the results do not support the participation of ticks as vectors of L. infantum in this area, which is likely to be transmitted by Lutzomyia spp. other than L. longipalpis. Finally, this study highlights that the use of IFAT in areas where both L. infantum and L. braziliensis are present should be withdraw in order to avoid the unnecessary culling of dogs that are actually infected only by L. braziliensis.

MartÃ­n, E. Cubero, R. Molina;Emerging trends in the seroprevalence of canine leishmaniosis in the Madrid region (central Spain);This report describes a cross-sectional serological survey of the epidemiology of canine leishmaniosis (CanL) performed in 2006 and 2007 in the Madrid region (central Spain) where the disease is endemic. The work presented here is one of the several studies conducted in different Spanish regions under the Integrated Project of the European Commission entitled Emerging Diseases in a changing European eNvironment (EDEN). The aim of this project is to identify and catalogue European ecosystems and environmental conditions that determine the spatial and temporal distributions and dynamics of several pathogenic agents including Leishmania infantum (EDEN-LEI). The study area (Madrid Autonomous Region) was selected on the grounds of its wide altitude range. This area was surveyed from NE to SW across its mountain range (Sistema Central) and plateau area. One thousand and seventy-six dogs from 32 villages were examined for clinical signs of CanL, and serum samples were obtained to determine several haematological and biochemical variables. Leishmaniosis-specific antibodies were identified using an indirect immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT). 87 of the 1076 dogs were seropositive for the protozoan (IFAT: cut-off â‰¥ 1/80) indicating a seroprevalence of 8.1% (0-16.1% depending on the village). On the basis of a physical examination and the biochemical/haematological status of each dog, 32 of the 87 infected dogs were described as clinically healthy (37%). Seroprevalence showed a peak in young dogs (1-2 years) and a second larger peak among the older dogs (7-8 years). Factors correlated with a higher infection risk were age (OR = 1.15 [95% CI: 1.07-1.22]), weight (OR = 1.10 [95% CI: 1.04-1.16]), and living outdoors as opposed to in a home (OR = 3.38 [95% CI: 1.42-8.05]). According to data from studies performed in 1992 in the same area, the seroprevalence of CanL has increased 1.54-fold [95% CI: 1.04-2.29]. Given that this increasing trend cannot be attributed to differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of the dog populations, it is proposed that environmental changes could have had an impact on vector and reservoir densities and their geographical distributions. Further studies designed to explain this trend should attempt to correlate sand fly densities and CanL seroprevalences with climate, land use and human changes.

Costa, J. MacHado, D. Diz-Lopes, G. Baneth;Canine babesiosis in northern Portugal and molecular characterization of vector-borne co-infections;"Background. Protozoa and bacteria transmitted by arthropods, including ticks and phlebotomine sand flies, may cause a wide range of canine vector-borne diseases. Dogs can be simultaneously or sequentially infected with multiple pathogens. Canine babesiosis caused by Babesia canis canis and Babesia canis vogeli is known to occur in Portugal. This study assessed, by means of blood smear examination, PCR and DNA nucleotide sequencing, the presence of Babesia spp. and co-infecting agents Leishmania, Anaplasma/Ehrlichia and Hepatozoon in 45 dogs from northern Portugal clinically suspected of babesiosis. Results. Forty-four dogs (98%) had infection with B. canis canis and one with B. canis vogeli. Co-infections were detected in nine animals (20%). Eight dogs were found infected with two vector-borne agents: six with B. canis canis and Leishmania infantum; one with B. canis canis and Ehrlichia canis; and one with B. canis canis and Hepatozoon canis. Another dog was infected with three vector-borne pathogens: B. canis vogeli, E. canis and L. infantum. Overall, L. infantum was found in seven (16%), E. canis in two (4%), and H. canis in one (2%) out of the 45 dogs with babesiosis. Almost 90% of the 45 cases of canine babesiosis were diagnosed in the colder months of October (18%), November (27%), December (20%), February (13%) and March (9%). Co-infections were detected in February, March, April, May, October and November. Twenty-two (50%) out of 44 dogs infected with B. canis were found infested by ticks including Dermacentor spp., Ixodes spp. and Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Mortality (9%) included two co-infected dogs that died spontaneously and two with single infections that were euthanized. Conclusions. Babesia canis canis is the main etiological agent of canine babesiosis in northern Portugal. A higher sensitivity of Babesia spp. detection was obtained with PCR assays, compared to the observation of blood smears. Twenty percent of the dogs were co-infected with L. infantum, E. canis or H. canis. Furthermore, this is the first molecular identification of H. canis in dogs from northern Portugal.

Naucke;Imported and travelling dogs as carriers of canine vector-borne pathogens in Germany;Background. With the import of pets and pets taken abroad, arthropod-borne diseases have increased in frequency in German veterinary practices. This is reflected by 4,681 dogs that have been either travelled to or relocated from endemic areas to Germany. The case history of these dogs and the laboratory findings have been compared with samples collected from 331 dogs living in an endemic area in Portugal. The various pathogens and the seroprevalences were examined to determine the occurrence of, and thus infection risk, for vector-borne pathogens in popular travel destinations. Results. 4,681 dogs were examined serological for Leishmania infantum, Babesia canis and Ehrlichia canis. Buffy coats were detected for Hepatozoon canis and blood samples were examined for microfilariae via the Knott's test. The samples were sent in from animal welfare organizations or private persons via veterinary clinics. Upon individual requests, dogs were additionally examined serological for Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi and Rickettsia conorii. Overall B. canis was the most prevalent pathogen detected by antibody titers (23.4%), followed by L. infantum (12.2%) and E. canis (10.1%). Microfilariae were detected in 7.7% and H. canis in 2.7% of the examined dogs. In 332/1862 dogs A. phagocytophilum, in 64/212 B. burgdorferi and in 20/58 R. conorii was detected. Of the 4,681 dogs, in total 4,226 were imported to Germany from endemic areas. Eighty seven dogs joined their owners for a vacation abroad. In comparison to the laboratory data from Germany, we examined 331 dogs from Portugal. The prevalence of antibodies/pathogens we detected was: 62.8% to R. conorii, 58% to B. canis, 30.5% to A. phagocytophilum, 24.8% to E. canis, 21.1% to H. canis (via PCR), 9.1% to L. infantum and 5.3% to microfilariae. Conclusions. The examination of 4,681 dogs living in Germany showed pathogens like L. infantum that are non-endemic in Germany. Furthermore, the German data are similar in terms of multiple pathogen infection to the data recorded for dogs from Portugal. Based on these findings the importation of dogs from endemic predominantly Mediterranean regions to Germany as well as travelling with dogs to these regions carries a significant risk of acquiring an infection. Thus we would conclude that pet owners seek advice of the veterinarians prior to importing a dog from an endemic area or travel to such areas. In general, it might be advisable to have a European recording system for translocation of dogs.

Microfilariae were detected in 7.7% and H. canis in 2.7% of the examined dogs. In 332/1862 dogs A. phagocytophilum, in 64/212 B. burgdorferi and in 20/58 R. conorii was detected. Of the 4,681 dogs, in total 4,226 were imported to Germany from endemic areas. Eighty seven dogs joined their owners for a vacation abroad. In comparison to the laboratory data from Germany, we examined 331 dogs from Portugal. The prevalence of antibodies/pathogens we detected was: 62.8% to R. conorii, 58% to B. canis, 30.5% to A. phagocytophilum, 24.8% to E. canis, 21.1% to H. canis (via PCR), 9.1% to L. infantum and 5.3% to microfilariae. Conclusions. The examination of 4,681 dogs living in Germany showed pathogens like L. infantum that are non-endemic in Germany. Furthermore, the German data are similar in terms of multiple pathogen infection to the data recorded for dogs from Portugal. Based on these findings the importation of dogs from endemic predominantly Mediterranean regions to Germany as well as travelling with dogs to these regions carries a significant risk of acquiring an infection. Thus we would conclude that pet owners seek advice of the veterinarians prior to importing a dog from an endemic area or travel to such areas. In general, it might be advisable to have a European recording system for translocation of dogs.

Sadjjadi, B. Sarkari;First report of natural infection in cats with leishmania infantum in Iran;Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by Leishmania infantum, is an endemic zoonosis in Iran. In recent years, Leishmania infection in cats has been reported in several countries where leishmaniasis is present. The aim of this study was to survey Leishmania infection in cats and to detect its causative agents in VL endemic areas in Iran. Forty stray cats were captured from two areas where VL is endemic, Fars and East Azerbaijan provinces. Infection with Leishmania was evaluated by parasitological and molecular methods. Leishmania parasites were detected in 4 out of 40 cats (10%). The parasite was isolated from the spleen of three and the liver of one cat and mass cultivated in the culture medium. Molecular and isoenzyme characterization revealed that the parasites isolated from the four cats were all L. infantum. Considering the high rate of feline Leishmania infection in this study, it may be suggested that cats have an epidemiological role in areas where VL is endemic in Iran.

Antoniou;Leishmaniases and the Cyprus Paradox;In Cyprus, leishmaniasis has been considered exclusively a veterinary problem. It was prevalent before 1945, and until its recent reemergence, it was nearly eradicated by 1996 as a consequence of the destruction of reservoir hosts and vectors. A survey carried out to provide an unbiased estimate of current transmission rates in dogs and humans showed a 9-fold increase in dog seroprevalence (reaching 14.9%) compared with 10 years ago. However, no human cases caused by Leishmania infantum were detected, although L. donovani cases were reported recently. The 62 strains isolated from dogs were typed as L. infantum MON-1 (98.4%), which is the predominating zymodeme in the Mediterranean region, and MON-98 (1.6%). The Phlebotomus species P. tobbi (vector of L. infantum in Cyprus), P. galilaeus, and P. papatasi were the predominant species captured. Two transmission cycles seem to run in parallel in Cyprus: in dogs with L. infantum and in humans with L. donovani.

Otranto;Detection of Leishmania infantum in Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks from Brazil and Italy;Canine leishmaniosis is a widespread disease caused by Leishmania parasites, which are transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. However, in some areas where canine leishmaniosis is endemic, but the primary vectors have not been found, ticks have been suspected to play a role in transmitting the infection. Herewith, we report the detection of Leishmania infantum kinetoplast minicircle DNA (kDNA) in ticks collected from naturally infected dogs living in rural areas of Southern Italy (site A) and Northeastern Brazil (site B). Between March and October 2007, ticks were collected from 26 dogs positive to anti-Leishmania antibodies (one from site A and 25 from site B) and either placed directly into vials containing 70% ethanol or maintained alive for identification and subsequent dissection. All the 95 ticks collected were morphologically identified as Rhipicephalus sanguineus. After identification, their genomic DNA was extracted (either individually or in pools) and processed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of L. infantum kDNA. Two pools of salivary glands from ticks (one from five females and other from five males) found on a dog from site A and tested by a conventional PCR were positive. Amplicon sequencing confirmed the identity of the parasite. In addition, nine (12.3%) out of the 73 ticks found on dogs from site B and tested by a real-time PCR were positive, with a low parasite load (less than 1 parasite/ml). The retrieval of L. infantum kDNA in salivary glands of R. sanguineus ticks has been here reported for the first time. Therefore, further studies are needed to assess the competence of ticks as vectors of Leishmania parasites from dog to dog.

Rajapakse, C. Sreekumar, J.P. Dubey;Surveillance for antibodies to Leishmania spp. in dogs from Sri Lanka;"The global distribution of leishmaniasis is rapidly expanding into new geographic regions. Dogs are the primary reservoir hosts for human visceral leishmaniasis caused by infection with Leishmania infantum. Natural infections with other Leishmania spp. can occur in dogs, but their role as reservoir hosts for other species of Leishmania is uncertain. Leishmania donovani is traditionally considered a visceralizing anthroponotic species; however, cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by L. donovani has been reported in Sri Lanka. In the present study, sera from 114 dogs in Sri Lanka were examined for antibodies to visceralizing Leishmania spp. Sera were tested by the canine immunochromatographic strip assays based on recombinant K39 antigen. Anti-Leishmania spp. antibodies were detectable in 1 of 114 (0.9) dogs from Sri Lanka. Nonetheless, serological evidence suggests that leishmaniasis may be an emerging zoonosis in Sri Lanka.

In addition, 121 serum samples from rural chickens (n = 73) and backyard birds (n = 48) were tested for anti-L. infantum antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence test. All the 19 animals showed to be molecularly positive at least at one tissue sample. In particular, 26 tissue samples from the experimentally infected chickens were positive on conventional PCR and/or qPCR but no clinical signs or seroconversion were detected and all tissue cultures were negative. Accordingly, all serum samples from rural chickens were negative whereas four (8.4%) from game birds (three Anser anser and one Phasianus colchicus) were positive. These results indicate that chickens are not suitable hosts for L. infantum under experimental condition. The occurrence of anti-L. infantum antibodies in domestic gooses (A. anser) and in a pheasant (P. colchicus) points out their possible role in the epidemiology of visceral leishmaniasis.

L. infantum-specific antibodies were detected by Western blotting (WB) in 39 subjects (7.41%), while L. infantum kinetoplast DNA was amplified from buffy coat in 21 out of 39 WB-positive subjects, confirming asymptomatic infection in 53.8% of seropositives. Risk factors significantly associated with WB positivity were uninterrupted residence since childhood in a local rural environment (odds ratio [OR], 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.7 to 7.3), daily contact with animals though not exclusively with dogs (OR, 3.7; 95% CI, 1.3 to 10.7), older age (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.2 to 4.5), and agricultural/other outdoor activities (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 0.99 to 3.7.) Logistic regression analysis showed that uninterrupted residence in a local rural environment and an age of >65 years were the only independent predictors of seropositivity assessed by WB. Follow-up at 24 months did not show evidence of VL in either seropositive or PCR-positive subjects. The detection of a high seroprevalence rate, confirmed as asymptomatic infection by PCR in more than half of the cases, among healthy residents in a continental area of northwestern Italy makes local L. infantum transmission very likely. In a region where VL is considered nonendemic, these findings warrant further epidemiological investigations as well as interventions with respect to both the canine reservoir and vectors, given the possible risks for immunosuppressed patients.

The detection of DNA was performed using specific primers. Amplicons were analyzed through electrophoresis and sequencing. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the UPGMA method, revealing that the sequences were closely related to those of strains from other geographic regions.

The object was to analyze the prevalence and incidence of human Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi infection as well as the dynamics evolution of its clinical-immunological profiles prior identified: (1) asymptomatic infection (AI); (2) symptomatic infection (SI=AVL); (3) sub-clinical oligosymptomatic infection (SOI); (4) sub-clinical resistant infection (SRI) and; (5) indeterminate initial infection (III). The infection diagnosis was performed by using both the indirect fluorescent antibody test and leishmanin skin test with amastigotes and promastigotes antigens of L. (L.) i. chagasi, respectively. A total of 187 cases of infection were recorded in the prevalence (17%), 117 in the final incidence (6.9%), and 304 in the accumulated prevalence (26.7%), which provided the following distribution into the clinical-immunological profiles: AI, 51.6%; III, 22.4%; SRI, 20.1%; SOI, 4.3%; and SI (=AVL), 1.6%. The major finding regarding the dynamics evolution of infection was concerned to III profile, from which the cases of infection evolved to either the resistant profiles, SRI (21 cases, 30.8%) and AI (30 cases, 44.1%), or the susceptible SI (=AVL; 1 case, 1.5%); the latter 16 cases remained as III till the end of the study. These results provided the conclusion that this diagnostic approach may be useful for monitoring human L. (L.) i. chagasi infection in endemic area and preventing the high morbidity of severe AVL cases.

Titone;Cryptic Leishmania infantum infection in Italian HIV infected patients;"Background: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a protozoan diseases caused in Europe by Leishmania (L.) infantum. Asymptomatic Leishmania infection is more frequent than clinically apparent disease. Among HIV infected patients the risk of clinical VL is increased due to immunosuppression, which can reactivate a latent infection. The aims of our study were to assess the prevalence of asymptomatic L. infantum infection in HIV infected patients and to study a possible correlation between Leishmania parasitemia and HIV infection markers. Methods: One hundred and forty-five HIV infected patients were screened for the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies and L. infantum DNA in peripheral blood. Statistical analysis was carried out by using a univariate regression analysis. Results: Antibodies to L. infantum were detected in 1.4% of patients. L. infantum DNA was detected in 16.5% of patients. Significant association for PCR-Leishmania levels with plasma viral load was documented (p = 0.0001). Conclusion: In our area a considerable proportion of HIV infected patients are asymptomatic carriers of L. infantum infection. A relationship between high HIV viral load and high parasitemic burden, possibly related to a higher risk of developing symptomatic disease, is suggested. PCR could be used for periodic screening of HIV patients to individuate those with higher risk of reactivation of L. infantum infection.

For this purpose 130 dogs were included in the study. Of these, 94.6% were infested with ticks. Altogether, 1293 ticks of the genus Rhipicephalus (in all evaluated cases R. sanguineus) were collected. Examination for haemotropic parasites was performed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Lymph node fine-needle aspirates were screened by PCR for Leishmania infantum infections in 20 dogs with enlarged lymph nodes. Our investigation revealed two species of protozoa (Babesia canis vogeli and Hepatozoon canis) and two species of rickettsiae (Anaplasma platys and Ehrlichia canis). In 101 dogs (77.7%) DNA of one or more pathogens was detected. The PCR examination for H. canis was positive in 83 dogs (63.8%), for E. canis in 34 dogs (26.2%), for A. platys in 10 dogs (7.7%) and for B. canis in five dogs (3.8%), whereas neither B. gibsoni nor L. infantum DNA could be detected. Of the infected dogs, 71.3% had a monoinfection, 27.7% had infections with two pathogens and 1.0% with three pathogens. B. canis, H. canis, E. canis, A. platys and their vector tick R. sanguineus are endemic to Cape Verde and can be present in dogs in high prevalences.

Davoust;Canine leishmaniasis in south-east of France: Screening of Leishmania infantum antibodies (western blotting, ELISA) and parasitaemia levels by PCR quantification;Leishmania infantum leishmaniasis is endemic in south-east of France. The main goal of our study was to evaluate the real prevalence of asymptomatic carriage in dogs by means of real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and serology. We included prospectively 140 military dogs wearing deltamethrine-impregnated collars. Parasitaemia levels were then measured by means of quantitative real time PCR targeting kinetoplast DNA with TaqManÂ® chemistry. ELISA and western blotting (WB) were used for serological screening. The number of dogs working in three areas was the following: Var (n = 48), Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne (n = 61) and Corsica (n = 31). Prevalence of symptomatic dogs was 0.7% (n = 1). ELISA and WB were positive in one (0.71%) and 19 (14%) dogs, respectively. Fifty-eight dogs (41.4%) had a positive parasitaemia. Global prevalence (positive WB and/or positive qPCR) was 50% (n = 70). Mean parasitaemia was 0.018 parasites/mL in the global population and 0.043 parasites/mL in positive dogs [min: 0.0002 to max: 2]. The concordance percent for WB and qPCR results was 55% (n = 77). Regarding the prevalence of positive parasitaemia, a significant difference was noticed between dogs living in the Var region and those coming from the two other areas. Parasitaemia was rapidly positive within the first semester of stay in an enzootic area. Despite the use of deltamethrine-impregnated collars, the proportion of dogs with low parasitaemia is important. Thus, it may be relevant to evaluate the effect of screening and treating asymptomatic canine reservoirs on human infection by performing further studies comparing both populations.

Campino;Molecular detection of Leishmania infantum in naturally infected phlebotomus perniciosus from Algarve Region, Portugal;"Background & objectives: In Portugal, Phlebotomus perniciosus and P. ariasi, (Subgenus Larroussius; Diptera: Psychodidae) are the proven vectors of leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum. The Algarve Region in southern Portugal has been considered an endemic focus of leishmaniasis since 1980s. The main objective of the present study was to validate a molecular approach to detect Leishmania infection in phlebotomines based on DNA extraction from the female sandfly whole body, minus genitalia, followed by PCR for application on epidemiological surveys. Methods: In Algarve Region, from early May until early November 2006, sandflies were captured by CDC miniature light-traps. kDNA-PCR and ITS1-PCR were used to screen the presence of Leishmania DNA in female sandflies after species identification by entomological keys. Results: A total of 474 sandflies were collected in 108 biotopes. One female of P. perniciosus, the predominant species, was found infected with L. infantum reflecting an overall infection rate of 0.47%. Interpretation & conclusion: PCR associated with morphological characterization of the sandflies will be a powerful epidemiological tool for the determination of the number of phlebotomines infected with Leishmania spp in nature. In addition, the simultaneous occurrence of dogs and P. perniciosus infected with L. infantum shows that Algarve continues to be an endemic focus of canine leishmaniasis. Furthermore, as P. sergenti and P. papatasi which transmit L. tropica and L. major, respectively were present, the future introduction of these two Leishmania species in southern region of Portugal should not be neglected.";;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:46;;;;;272;;;;;;;4;Journal of Vector Borne Diseases;Leishmania infantum,PCR,Phlebotomus perniciosus,Portugal,article,controlled study,DNA extraction,DNA screening,infection rate,Leishmania infantum,leishmaniasis,nonhuman,parasite vector,Phlebotomus,phlebotomus perniciosus,polymerase chain reaction,Portugal,Animals,Cats,Dogs,Female,Leishmania infantum,Male,Phlebotomus,Polymerase Chain Reaction;;Cited By :16,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;268;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-73449121078&partnerID=40&md5=ae4629402cad2ec1628ce90a6b016fb2;46;2009;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

This was a cross-sectional study with a cohort of 946 individuals, of both genders, from the age of 1 year, living in the municipality of Barcarena, PA, Brazil, an area endemic for American visceral leishmaniasis (AVL). The leishmanin skin test (LST) and the indirect fluorescent test (IFAT), were used for the diagnosis of infection. One hundred and twenty cases of infection were diagnosed, with a prevalence rate of 12.6%; eight cases showed high seroreactivity (1280-10 240, IgG) in IFAT and no LST reaction; four of these cases were typical AVL and four had subclinical oligosymptomatic infection. Using two immunological methods with a clinical examination of the infected individuals enabled the identification of five clinical-immunological profiles which may promote a better understanding of the interaction between L. (L.) i. chagasi and the human immune response: asymptomatic infection (AI) 73.4%; subclinical resistant infection (SRI) 15%; subclinical oligosymptomatic infection (SOI) 3%; symptomatic infection (AVL) 3% and indeterminate initial infection (III) 5%.

Dedet;The potential effects of global warming on changes in canine leishmaniasis in a focus outside the classical area of the disease in Southern France;In 1994, an ecoepidemiologic study was carried out in the mid-AriÃ¨ge valley (French Pyrenees) where autochthonous cases of canine leishmaniasis had been previously reported. Serologic samples were collected from 336 dogs in two groups of villages. The seroprevalences were 11.67% in the valley villages and only 1.43% in the foothill villages. Five lymph node biopsies were taken from serologically positive dogs, and resultant isolates were identified as Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON-1. Phlebotomine sandflies were collected in five locations by CDC light traps. Both of the known French vectors, Phlebotomus ariasi and P. perniciosus, were identified. Bioclimatic and floristic studies showed that this area is an enclave of the supra-Mediterranean climatic zone, containing a typically xerothermophilic Mediterranean flora. The Pyrenees Mountains are usually considered to be outside of the endemic range of leishmaniasis in southern France, and so our demonstration of a microfocus of canine leishmaniasis in the northern foothills is noteworthy. A second serologic survey carried out in 2007 (216 dogs) showed an inversion of the seropositive rates between the two groups of villages compared with those of 1994: only 2.72% in the valley villages and 11.32% in the foothills villages. The decrease of seroprevalence in the first area (valley villages) can be related to a considerable use of deltamethrin collars during the transmission season. The increase of seroprevalence of the foothill villages could be related to climatic conditions, since there was an increase of about 1Â°C in the mean annual temperature.

We applied polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods to detect Leishmania spp. parasites and blood meals within individual sand flies in the most important visceral leishmaniasis (VL) focus in northwestern Iran. Leishmania spp. minicircles (kinetoplast DNA) were found in 14 (0.9%) of 1,569 female specimens. Sequence analysis of 650 basepairs of an internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA gene identified L. infantum/L. donovani in 12 specimens and L. adleri-like parasites in 2 specimens. Nine (64.3%) of 14 of the Leishmania spp.-positive sand flies were Phlebotomus perfeliewi transcaucasicus. Blood meal identification of host DNA within sand flies by PCR-based and ELISA methods showed that 30% and 28%, respectively, were positive for human blood. Results of this study showed that P. perfeliewi transcaucasicus is the most prevalent, infected, and anthropophagic sand fly and plays a major role in VL transmission in the region studied.

Gramiccia;Cutaneous leishmaniasis in North-Western Yemen: A clinicoepidemiologic study and Leishmania species identification by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis;"Background: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is widespread in Yemen, but not fully documented. Objective: To study the clinicoepidemiologic profile of CL in the northwestern region of Yemen Republic and to identify the responsible Leishmania species by molecular methods. Methods: All 265 CL cases (176 males and 89 females) were subjected to detailed analysis. Diagnosis was based on clinical features, positive slit skin smear, and histopathologic findings in some cases. In 198 cases, positive smears were examined at the Leishmania Reference Centre of Istituto Superiore di SanitÃ , Rome (Italy), by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis for Leishmania typing. Results: All patients were Yemeni nationals, originated from 10 governorates of northwestern Yemen. Most of the patients had a single noduloulcerative lesion on the face suggestive of ""dry""-type CL. Slit skin smear was positive in 255 cases (96.23%). Leishmania sp PCR was positive in all 198 cases examined; the RFLP analysis was positive in 155 samples with the following identification results: L tropica in 133 cases (85.80%), L infantum in 17 (10.97%), and L donovani in 5 (3.23%). Limitations: This was a prospective study of CL cases at one center only; hence, the full extent of the disease in the entire region cannot be predicted. Conclusion: CL appears to be endemic in northwestern region of Yemen, clinically presenting as 'dry' type, caused mainly by L tropica (85.8% of cases) and occasionally by L infantum (10.97%) and L donovani (3.23%). There is a need for a multicenter study to evaluate the extent of the disease and diffusion of each Leishmania responsible species.

Azizi, M. Mohebali;Phlebotomus perfiliewi transcaucasicus, a vector of leishmania infantum in northwestern Iran;Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by Leishmania infantum, which is transmitted to humans by bites of phlebotomine sand flies and is one of the most important public health problems in Iran. To identify the vector (s), an investigation was carried out in Germi district, an important focus of the disease in Ardebil province in northwestern Iran, during July-September 2004 and 2005. Using sticky papers, CDC light traps and aspirators, 3,560 sand flies were collected and identified to species. Host bloodmeal preference and Leishmania infections in female specimens were evaluated using enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the former and microscopic examination followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using species-specific kinetoplast minicircle primers for the latter. Nine sand fly species are present in the district, including Phlebotomus kandelakii Shchurenkova, Phlebotomus perfiliewi transcaucasicus Perfil'ev, Phlebotomus major Annandale, Phlebotomus balcanicus Theodor, Phlebotomus halepensis Theodor, Phlebotomus brevis Theodor & Meshghali, Phlebotomus papatasi Scopoli, Sergentomyia dentata Sinton, and Sergentomyia sintoni Pringle, with P. p. transcaucasicus being the most prevalent representative of the genus Phlebotomus at 45%. The anthropophilic index for P. p. transcaucasicus was 36.3%, indicating a strong preference for humans. Of 905 female P. p. transcuacasicus dissected, 10 (1.1%) were found naturally infected with promastigotes. Species-specific amplification of promastigotes eluted from Giemsa-stained slides revealed specific PCR products of L. infantum DNA. Based on its high anthropophily and natural infections with L. infantum, and the fact that it was the only species found infected with L. infantum, we conclude that P. p. transcaucasicus is the principal vector of L. infantum in northwestern Iran.

Yoshinari;Hepatozoon canis infecting dogs in the State of EspÃ­rito Santo, southeastern Brazil;"From May 2007 to March 2008, blood samples were collected from 92 healthy dogs living in 21 households (17 farms in rural area, and 4 homes in urban area) in 6 counties of the State of EspÃ­rito Santo, southeastern Brazil. In addition, ticks were collected from these dogs. A mean of 4.4 Â± 3.0 dogs (range: 1-12) were sampled per household; 78 and 14 dogs were from rural and urban areas, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed to amplify fragments of the 18S rDNA gene of Babesia spp or Hepatozoon spp revealed amplicons of the expected size in 20 (21.7%) dogs for Babesia, and 54 (58.7%) dogs for Hepatozoon. All Babesia-positive dogs were also Hepatozoon-positive. Among the 21 households, 15 (71.4%) from 3 counties had at least one PCR-positive dog, including 13 farms (rural area) and 2 homes (urban area). A total of 40 PCR products from the Hepatozoon-PCR, and 19 products from the Babesia-PCR were submitted to DNA sequencing. All generated sequences from Hepatozoon-PCR were identical to each other, and to corresponding 18S rDNA sequences of H. canis in GenBank. Surprisingly, all generated sequences from the Babesia PCR were also identical to corresponding 18S rDNA sequences of H. canis in GenBank. Dogs from 10 rural and 2 urban households were found infested by Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks. Immature of Amblyomma cajennense ticks were found in dogs from only 4 rural households (also infested by R. sanguineus). All but one household with R. sanguineus-infested dogs had at least one Hepatozoon-infected dog. Statistical analysis showed that the presence of ticks (i.e. R. sanguineus) infesting dogs in the households was significantly (P < 0.05) associated with at least one PCR-positive dog. There was no significant association (P > 0.05) between PCR-positive dogs and urban or rural households. Canine hepatozoonosis caused by H. canis is a high frequent infection in EspÃ­rito Santo, Brazil, where it is possibly vectored by R. sanguineus. Since all infected dogs were found apparently healthy, the pathogenicity of H. canis for dogs in EspÃ­rito Santo is yet to be elucidated. Â© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Bloodsucking sand flies of the subfamily Phlebotominae are the obligatory insect hosts, and the dog is the only domestic reservoir. This study reports data from a survey of canine infection and sand fly phlebotomine monitoring in the province of Perugia in central Italy. The overall seroprevalence in a total of 100 dogs tested was 8% (95% confidence interval: 3.8-15.6%). Data analysis revealed that serological positivity was statistically associated with age (p-value = 0.03) and the area where dogs lived. Standard blacklight traps employed for sampling Culicoides midges in bluetongue disease surveillance were used in phlebotomine monitoring. A total of 5698 sand flies were collected and the two species, Leishmania competent vectors, were identified, Phlebotomus perfiliewi (50%) and Phlebotomus perniciosus (30%). Â© 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Schnian;Identification of the agent causing visceral leishmaniasis in Uzbeki and Tajiki foci by analysing parasite DNA extracted from patients' Giemsa-stained tissue preparations;Our present study is the first attempt to characterize Leishmania parasites from foci in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan endemic for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). PCR-sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 and multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT) were applied to DNA extracted from preparations of Giemsa-stained bone marrow aspirates from 13 cases of VL. L. infantum was shown to cause VL currently occurring in this area. MLMT applying 14 microsatellite markers, previously shown to be polymorphic for strains of the L. donovani complex, revealed that microsatellite profiles of parasites causing human VL in the Namangan and Jizzakh regions in Uzbekistan, and Penjikent region in Tajikistan, basically coincide with those of strains of L. infantum MON-1. Furthermore, these parasites were assigned to a distinct cluster genetically clearly separated from the populations of L. infantum MON-1 from Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. The existence of a genetically homogeneous but distinct group of L. infantum MON-1 indicates that the parasites circulating in the Uzbeki and Tajiki foci studied have been restricted there for a long time rather than having been recently introduced from elsewhere by human or animal reservoir migration.

All cases were in children less than 9 years old (median age 2 years). The average number of cases was 5.06/year and the average annual incidence was 3.02/100 000 children. Ribosomal internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) PCR-RFLP was performed using DNA extracted from two cultures and 36 archived Giemsa-stained slides from VL patients. Leishmania infantum was revealed as the causative agent of VL in the focus. Isoenzyme analysis identified two isolates as zymodeme MON-1. A serological survey of 455 children screened for serum anti-Leishmania antibodies revealed 8.4% seropositivity. Seropositivity was highest for children in households of previous VL cases [odds ratio (OR) 7.5; 95% CI 3.17-17.61; P < 0.001] and among people who had domestic dogs and/or other animals (OR 2.4; 95% CI 1.19-4.68; P = 0.017). No difference was seen between males and females (P = 0.073). A preliminary survey of sand fly distribution showed the abundance of two putative vector species: Phlebotomus syriacus (45%) and Ph. tobbi (10%).

Detection and identification of Leishmania parasites in sand flies;"Sand flies collected between April 2003 and November 2004 at Tallil Air Base, Iraq, were evaluated for the presence of Leishmania parasites using a combination of a real-time Leishmania- generic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and sequencing of a 360-bp fragment of the glucose- 6-phosphate-isomerase (GPI) gene. A total of 2,505 pools containing 26,574 sand flies were tested using the real-time PCR assay. Leishmania DNA was initially detected in 536 pools; however, after extensive retesting with the real-time PCR assay, a total of 456 pools were considered positive and 80 were considered indeterminate. A total of 532 samples were evaluated for Leishmania GPI by sequencing, to include 439 PCR-positive samples, 80 PCR-indeterminate samples, and 13 PCR-negative samples. Leishmania GPI was detected in 284 samples that were sequenced, to include 281 (64%) of the PCR-positive samples and 3 (4%) of the PCR-indeterminate samples. Of the 284 sequences identified as Leishmanial! (91.9%) were L. tarentolae, 18 (6.3%) wereL. donowoni-complex parasites, 3 (1.1%) were L. tropica, and 2 were similar to both L. major and L. tropica. Minimum field infection rates were 0.09% for L. donovani-complex parasites, 0.02% for L. tropica, and 0.01% for the L. major/tropica-like parasite. Subsequent sequencing of a 600-bp region of the ""Hyper"" gene of 12 of the L. donovani- complex parasites showed that all 12 parasites were L. infantum.

Grimaldi;Cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiologic surveys of human and canine Leishmania infantum visceral infections in an endemic rural area of southeast Brazil (Pancas, EspÃ­rito Santo);In an endemic rural area of southeast Brazil, surveys confirmed that dogs serve as peridomestic reservoirs of Leishmania infantum. It is likely that the lack of efficient control is because presently used diagnostic tests miss positive dogs. Overall, 57% of the dogs had specific antibodies, but the canine infection was not uniformly fatal and many seropositive dogs remained asymptomatic or even spontaneously recovered. Furthermore, 42% of the human residents became leishmanin-positive reactors and 47% had positive serology at the initial survey, but our estimates also point at a high recovery rate among the infected population with time. The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction to Leishmania was a good indicator of resistance to infection in this particular epidemiologic situation. The lack of any significant differences in infection rates by gender or age indicate that all of the population was at an equal risk of infection and most people were infected in the peridomestic setting.

Floeter-Winter;The finding of Lutzomyia almerioi and Lutzomyia longipalpis naturally infected by Leishmania spp. in a cutaneous and canine visceral leishmaniases focus in Serra da Bodoquena, Brazil;To identify natural infections by Leishmania spp. in insect vectors of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, we performed field studies in natural and anthropic environments in the Guaicurus Settlement (Bodoquena Range) of the Bonito municipality, Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. From October 2002 to October 2003, a total of 1395 sandfly females were captured with Shannon and light traps and dissected in search of flagellates. The sample is composed of a total of 13 species, with Lutzomyia almerioi (59.9%) and Lutzomyia longipalpis (31.4%) predominant. Infections by flagellates were directly observed in three of the dissected of Lu. almerioi females (0.36%). To increase the sensitivity of detection, DNA extracted from pools of the 1220 dissected females (Lu. almerioi 808, Lu. longipalpis 399 and Nyssomyia whitmani 13) was subjected to small subunit rRNA-based polymerase chain reactions (SSU-PCR). DNA from Leishmania (L.) infantum chagasi was detected in at least 0.37% of Lu. almerioi females and in 0.25% of Lu. longipalpis females. The DNA of the Leishmania (Viannia) sp. was detected in 0.12% of Lu. almerioi and in 0.70% of Lu. longipalpis. Leishmania (L.) amazonensis was found in 1.25% of Lu. longipalpis. Mixed infections of L. (Leishmania) sp. and L. (Viannia) sp. were found in 0.50% of Lu. longipalpis. When considering that each positive pool contained at least a single infected specimen, we found a 1.23% rate of Leishmania spp. infection among the total population of dissected female sand flies as determined by PCR. This is the first report of natural infection by L. (L.) infantum chagasi and L. (Viannia) sp. in Lu. almerioi. It is also the first report of infection by L. (Viannia) sp. in Lu. longipalpis. The observation that Lu. longipalpis and Lu. almerioi are naturally infected by agents of both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniases suggests that these two species play a role in the transmission of these diseases within the study area. Furthermore, the finding that Lu. longipalpis has been naturally infected by L. (L.) amazonensis and L. (Viannia) sp., and Lu. almerioi by L. (L.) infantum chagasi and L. (Viannia), suggests their participation as permissive vectors. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Mancianti;Hepatozoonosis in a dog with skeletal involvement and meningoencephalomyelitis;"A 15-month-old, female mongrel dog was presented with a 6- week history of inappetence, weight loss, and tetraparesis. Physical examination revealed weakness, poor body condition, mild fever, pale mucous membranes, and diffuse muscle atrophy. The right hind limb was painful and edematous, with large ecchymoses. The femur was irregular on palpation and moderate popliteal lymphadenopathy was evident. Results of a CBC showed severe anemia with mild regeneration, an inflammatory leukogram with 90% of neutrophils parasitized by Hepatozoon sp. gamonts, and moderate thrombocytopenia. A bone marrow aspirate had myeloid hyperplasia and contained a few extracellular Hepatozoon meronts and a few intracellular gamonts within neutrophils. Serum chemistry abnormalities included hypoalbuminemia, hyperglobulinemia, hypoglycemia, hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and elevated alkaline phosphatase activity. Radiologic findings of the right femur included periosteal bone proliferation and lesions compatible with osteomyelitis. A fine needle aspirate specimen from the bone lesion had neutrophilic inflammation; 36% of the neutrophils contained Hepatozoon gamonts. Results of cerebrospinal fluid analysis included a protein concentration of 37 mg/dL and marked mononuclear pleocytosis (243 cell/mL) with a predominance of lymphocytes. An ELISA was positive for Hepatozoon canis and PCR results with DNA sequencing confirmed infection with this organism. A diagnosis of hepatozoonosis with skeletal involvement and meningoencephalomyelitis was made. The dog recovered almost completely neurologically and had no gamonts in the blood after 60 days of therapy with imidocarb dipropionate and prednisone. This is an unusual case of canine hepatozoonosis involving neurologic signs and a periosteal reaction more typical of H. americanum infection and rarely reported in dogs infected with H. canis.

Capelli;Toward diagnosing Leishmania infantum infection in asymptomatic dogs in an area where leishmaniasis is endemic;The most frequently used diagnostic methods were compared in a longitudinal survey with Leishmania infantum-infected asymptomatic dogs from an area of Italy where leishmaniasis is endemic. In February and March 2005, 845 asymptomatic dogs were tested by an immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT), a dipstick assay (DS), and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for L. infantum and by IFAT for Ehrlichia canis. Dogs seronegative for L. infantum were further parasitologically evaluated by microscopic examination of lymph node tissues and PCR of skin samples. A total of 204 animals both serologically and parasitologically negative for L. infantum at the first sampling were enrolled in the trial and were further examined for canine leishmaniasis (CanL) and canine monocytic ehrlichiosis in November 2005 (i.e., the end of the first sandfly season) and March 2006 and 2007 (1- and 2-year follow-ups, respectively). At the initial screening, the overall rates of L. infantum seroprevalence were 9.5% by IFAT, 17.1% by ELISA, and 9.8% by DS and the overall rate of E. canis seroprevalence was 15%. The rates of concordance between the results of IFAT and DS were almost equal, whereas the rate of concordance between the results of IFAT and DS and those of the ELISA was lower. The results of the annual incidence of Leishmania infection were variable, depending on the test employed, with the highest values registered for PCR (i.e., 5.7% and 11.4% at the 1- and 2-year follow-ups, respectively), followed by ELISA, IFAT, and DS. Over the 2 years of observation, 55 animals (i.e., 26.9%) became positive for L. infantum by one or more diagnostic tests at different follow-up times, with 12.7% showing clinical signs related to CanL, while the remaining 87.3% were asymptomatic. A diagnostic scheme for assessment of the L. infantum infection status in asymptomatic dogs is suggested. Copyright Â© 2009, American Society for Microbiology.

Veterinarians clinically examined all dogs, and the titer of anti-te/shman/a antibodies was determined by indirect immune-fluorescence antibody test. The presence of Leishmania was performed by PCR and in vitro culture. IFAT was positive in 1 2 % of dogs and promastigote form of the parasite was isolated by in vitro culture from only 4.5 % of them. However, DNA of Leishmania was detected by PCR in 20.9 % of dogs. PCR was more sensitive than IFAT (p = 0.004) and in vitro culture (p&lt; 10-5). A prevalence of 21 % was found in Kairouan, which is significant high (p &lt; 10-3) when compared to that of thirty years ago. This state is in correlation with the increase in other Mediterranean countries. Furthermore, 50 % of positive dogs were asymptomatic.

The object was to analyze the transmission dynamics of human Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum chagasi infection based principally on the prevalence and incidence. For diagnosis of the infection, the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and leishmanin skin test (LST) were performed with amastigote and promastigote antigens of the parasite, respectively. The prevalence by LST (11.2%) was higher (pâˆˆ<âˆˆ0.0001) than that (3.4%) by IFAT, and the combined prevalence by both tests was 12.6%. The incidences by LST were also higher (pâˆˆ<âˆˆ0.05) than those by IFAT at 6 (4. 7%âˆˆÃ—âˆˆ0.6%), 12 (4.7%âˆˆÃ—âˆˆ2.7%), and 24 months (2.9%âˆˆÃ—âˆˆ0.3%). Moreover, there were no differences (pâˆˆ>âˆˆ0.05) between the combined incidences by both tests on the same point surveys, 5.2%, 6.3%, and 3.6%. During the study, 12 infected persons showed high IFAT IgG titers with no LST reactions: five children and two adults developed AVL (2,560-10,120), and two children and three adults developed subclinical oligosymptomatic infection (1,280-2,560).

Boucraut-Baralon, A. Alongi, A. Agnone, A. Torina;Hemoprotozoa of domestic animals in France: Prevalence and molecular characterization;Very limited information is available on epizootiology of haematozoan infections in French domestic animals. In an attempt to address this issue, prevalence of piroplasmida was studied in carnivores and ruminants, whereas prevalence of Hepatozoon spp. was only investigated in carnivores. In total, 383 animals were included in the survey (namely 116 cats, 108 dogs, 91 sheep and 68 cows). Parasite diagnosis was carried out using molecular methods such as PCR and sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene. In addition, ruminant samples were analyzed with the reverse line blotting technique (RLB). Results of RLB and PCR plus sequencing were in total agreement. In carnivores, haematozoan prevalence was close to 1%. Two cats were infected by H. canis (1.7% prevalence) and one of them was co-infected by Cytauxzoon sp. (0.8%). This represents the first finding of both pathogens in French cats. One dog was infected by H. canis (0.9%) and another by Babesia canis vogeli (0.9%). In ruminants, haematozoan prevalence (piroplasmida) was significantly higher than in carnivores (4.8% in sheep and 8.8% in cow). Theileria ovis was found in 1 sheep, Theileria sp. in 2 sheep, Theileria buffeli in 5 cows and B. major in 1 cow. Evidence presented in this contribution indicates that haematic protozoa are not widely distributed in domestic mammal populations of France. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Small, non-ulcerating lesions prevailed and patients were negative in rK39 tests for antibody detection for human visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The most abundant sand fly species, Phlebotomus tobbi, was found positive for Leishmania promastigotes with a prevalence of 1.4% (13 out of 898 dissected females). The isolated strains were identical with those obtained from patients with CL and were typed as L. infantum. Phylogenetic analysis revealed similarity to MON-188 and a clear difference from the MON-1 clade. Blood-meal identification showed that P. tobbi feeds preferentially on cattle and humans. This finding, the high number of CL patients and relative scarcity of dogs in the focus, suggests that the transmission cycle could be anthroponotic.

Natalia, A. Nicola;Two cases of primary endonasal leishmaniasis in Sardinia (Italy);Leishmaniasis is an endemic protozoan infection in Sardinia, one of the major islands of the Mediterranean Basin. We report two cases of endonasal primary Leishmaniasis, which is a very rare event in adult men who are immunocompetent, born in, and residents of Sardinia. The diagnosis was confirmed by the presence of intra and extracellular Leishmania amastigotes in the histological smear. Isoenzymatic characterization identified Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON-111 in both cases. Laboratory and instrumental investigations excluded visceral involvement. Treatment with meglumine antimoniate (GlucantimÂ®) intralesional administration, 1ml weekly for 4-5 weeks, led to complete resolution. The unusual location is likely a reflection an uncommon site of inoculation of the protozoa, transmitted by flying vectors. The patients were a shepherd and a farmer, respectively, both professions at high risk of infection because of their habits of sleeping outdoors under trees or in country cottages during spring and summer and exposed to sand fly bites. Although mucosal involvement and infection by Leishmania infantum, a potential cause of visceral leishmaniasis, the Sardinian patients experienced a benign disease course considering mucocutaneous forms described in the New World. Differential diagnosis and early detection are necessary in order to start effective treatment and prevent more serious complications.

Asgari;Seroprevalence of feline leishmaniasis in areas of Iran where Leishtnania infantum is endemic;"The human leishmaniases are endemic diseases in 88 countries in the world (Desjeux, 2004). In Iran, human leishmaniasis is present in at least 20 of the 30 provinces, with human visceral leishmaniasis (VL), caused by Leishtnania infantum, endemic in the southern province of Fars and the eastern provinces of East Azarbayjan and Ardabil (Edrissian et al, 1988; Parvizi et al, 2008). Nourabad, Kavar, Kazeroun, Darab and Jahrom in Fars and Kalaybar and Azarshahr in East Azarbayjan are known to be main foci for the disease (Mohebali et al, 2005; Parvizi et al, 2008). Although dogs have long been considered the main reservoir of L. infantum in Iran (Mohebali et al, 2005), over the last decade cats have increasingly been recognised as secondary reservoirs in several L. infantumendemic areas (Mancianti, 2004; Martin- Sanchez et al, 2007; Maia et al, 2008). About 50 cases of feline leishmaniasis have been reported so far, asymptomatic L. infantum infection or clinical disease attributed to this parasite having being detected in domestic cats in Italy, Spain, France and Brazil (Ozon et al, 1998; HervÃ¡s et al, 1999; Poli et al, 2002; Grevot et al, 2005; Da Silva etal, 2008). So far, nothing is known of the epidemiology of feline leishmaniasis in the VL-endemic areas of Iran. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the seroprevalence of leishmaniasis in cats living in the VL-endemic areas of the provinces of Fars and East Azarbayjan.

Villaescusa, F. Rodriguez-Franco, Ã. Sainz;Serologic and molecular evaluation of Leishmania infantum in cats from central Spain;Infection by different Leishmania spp. in cats has been reported in many countries. In Spain, since the first Leishmania infection described in 1933, sporadic clinical cases in cats have been reported. Various serologic studies performed in other areas of Spain have shown seroprevalences ranging between 1.7 and 60%. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of leishmaniasis in cats from Central Spain (Madrid), and to assess the existence of associations between Leishmania infantum infection and relevant data obtained from each cat. Two-hundred thirty-three cats attended at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Madrid between September 2005 and June 2006 were tested for L. infantum using the indirect immunofluorescent antibody (IFA) test (cutoff: 1:100) and PCR. PCR testing was performed on the samples to detect Leishmania infection, targeting the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). Our results showed a seroprevalence of 1.29% (3/233) using IFA test. Another seven cats were also seroreactive to L. infantum one dilution under the cutoff (1:50). Considering all the seroreactive samples, the percentage of positive animals to L. infantum was 4.29%. Only one of the cats (0.43%) included in the study was PCR-positive. Relative lymphocytosis and an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value were statistically associated with seroreactivity to L. infantum. Our results demonstrate the presence of cats seroreactive to L. infantum in Central Spain, an endemic area for this disease in dogs.

To detect asymptomatic individuals, we used kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-ELISA methods on 388 blood samples of healthy persons in two endemic loci and compared the results with the leishmanin skin test (LST) and the immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). kDNA PCR, LST, and IFAT were positive in 95 (24.5%), 132 (34%), and 212 (54.6%) cases, respectively. Fifty-five (21.4%) individuals that were LST negative were PCR positive. All PCR-positive individuals had a titer of â‰¥ 1:20, whereas 45% of those that were IFAT positive were PCR positive. For a reliable index of prevalence rate of infection, LST alone is not sufficient and needs to be accompanied by PCR-ELISA. The high rate of kDNA-positive results may indicate the possibility of humans being a reservoir and source of transmission. In endemic areas, kDNA PCR-ELISA is not a reliable test for the diagnosis of active VL.

Fakhar, M.H. Motazedian, G.R. Hatam, Q. Asgari, M. Kalantari, M. Mohebali;Asymptomatic human carriers of Leishmania infantum: Possible reservoirs for Mediterranean visceral leishmaniasis in southern Iran;Over the last decade, the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has increased in many districts of the province of Fars, in southern Iran. Recent epidemiological reports indicate that asymptomatic human infections with Leishmania infantum (the causative agent of VL throughout the Mediterranean basin) occur more frequently in Iran than was previously believed. Between 2004 and 2006, blood samples were collected from 802 apparently healthy subjects from communities, in the north-west and south-east of Fars province, where VL cases had been recorded. Each of these samples was tested for anti-Leishmania antibodies, in direct agglutination tests (DAT), and for L. infantum kinetoplast DNA, in PCR-based assays. Of the 426 subjects from north-western Fars, eight (1.9%) were found seropositive and 68 (16.0%) PCR-positive. The corresponding values for the 376 subjects from south-eastern Fars were lower, with five (1.3%) seropositive and 32 (8.5%) PCR-positive. Of the 100 PCR-positive subjects, 18 (18.0%) each lived in a household in which there had been a case of VL, and six (6.0%) had had VL themselves (in each case, more than a year before the blood sampling for the present study). Although 21 of the PCR-positives have now been followed-up for at least 18 months, none has developed symptomatic VL. Since positivity in the PCR-based assay probably indicated the presence of L. infantum amastigotes in the peripheral blood of 12.5% of the subjects, it is clear that asymptomatic human carriers of L. infantum are quite common in the study areas and probably act as reservoirs in the transmission of the parasite, to humans and to dogs, by sandflies.

The aim of this study was to assess the seroprevalence of Leishmania infantum infection in the general population and in HIV infected subjects of Northern Greece, bordering the Mediterranean basin where leishmaniasis is endemic. The clinical cases of the disease during the last 6 years (2001-2006) are also presented. A low frequency of L. infantum antibodies was found by IFA and ELISA in 1,525 healthy individuals (2.8%), aged 18-80 years, living in the 16 prefectures of Northern Greece (Macedonia and Thrace regions), and in 167 HIV positive subjects (0.6%). Fifty-seven clinical cases were diagnosed in the same area and an approximate annual incidence of 0.34/100,000 was estimated. No endemic foci were identified and the cases of the disease were sporadic. Most presented with the visceral form (VL), few with the cutaneous, and one with VL-HIV co-infection. A significant shift in the age of people at risk was observed, with children less affected than adults (children/adults ratio: 0.36). No relevant data from previous studies are available to demonstrate a possible change of the infection in Northern Greece. The results of this study could be used as a reference for leishmaniasis surveillance in the area.

Ready;Two Leishmania species circulating in the Kaleybar focus of infantile visceral leishmaniasis, northwest Iran: implications for deltamethrin dog collar intervention;Leishmania infantum is the causative agent of infantile visceral leishmaniasis (IVL) in the Mediterranean Basin and, based on isoenzyme typing of a few isolates from patients and domestic dogs, this parasite was considered to predominate in the Kaleybar focus of IVL in northwest Iran. However, in the current investigation only one out of five sandfly infections was found to be L. infantum, based on PCR detection and sequencing of parasite internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA infecting Phlebotomus perfiliewi transcaucasicus. The four other infections were of haplotypes of L. tropica, the causative agent of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis in the Middle East and a parasite occasionally detected in the viscera of dogs and patients in Iran and elsewhere. The widespread distribution of L. tropica in the Kaleybar focus suggests that this parasite is not a transient introduction. Kaleybar has been used for a deltamethrin dog collar intervention to reduce the biting rates of the vectors of L. infantum and this has significantly reduced the incidence of Leishmania infections both in children and the domestic dog, the usual reservoir host of IVL. The implications of finding L. tropica widespread in the heart of the intervention area are discussed. Extensive and intensive typing of natural Leishmania infections is a characteristic of epidemiological investigations in the Neotropics and the current report indicates that this will also be necessary in some regions of the Old World.

Campino;Importance of cats in zoonotic leishmaniasis in Portugal;Leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania infantum, is an endemic zoonosis in the Mediterranean basin. Dogs are considered the major host for these parasites, as well as the main reservoir for human visceral infection. In recent years, asymptomatic infection or clinical disease caused by L. infantum in cats has been reported in several countries where zoonotic leishmaniasis is present. The aim of the present study was to perform a leishmaniasis survey in cats from an endemic focus. Twenty-three adult stray cats were surveyed by clinical examination, and peripheral blood samples for serological and molecular analysis were collected. In 7 of the 23 cats (30.4%) Leishmania DNA was detected in blood. A low level of fluorescent antibodies was detected in four serum samples. All the animals were asymptomatic. Taking into account the high rate of asymptomatic feline leishmaniasis in this survey, it can be suggested that cats may act as a habitual reservoir host of L. infantum infection in endemic areas. Furthermore, it will be important in the future to add this parasitosis to the differential diagnosis of feline infections from leishmaniasis foci in cats. Feline leishmaniasis diagnosis should be accessed by molecular tools.

In order to determine whether seasonality in transmission induces seasonal changes in the prevalence of infection by L. infantum and of parasite-specific immune response, two groups of dogs, one in February (n = 37) and another in October (n = 42), were studied. Clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis, as well as presence of microscopic skin lesions in the muzzle were recorded for all dogs. Assays were also performed for detection of L. infantum parasites in muzzle skin samples (PCR, immunohistochemistry and culture), specific serum antibodies (ELISA), and specific lymphocyte proliferation and interferon-Î³ production. Although prevalence of non-specific clinical signs increased significantly after the sandfly season, this was not the case for Leishmania-specific markers: positivity by PCR (24% vs. 21%) or immunohistochemistry (3% vs. 2%) of muzzle skin samples, as well as lymphocyte proliferation (59% vs. 50%) or interferon-Î³ production (21% vs. 27%) were similar in February and in October. Only prevalence of positive specific antibody titers increased noticeably in October (8% vs. 20%), although this was not statistically significant. Overall, the sandfly season did not have a marked impact on the prevalence L. infantum infection or parasite-specific immune responses analyzed in this study. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To characterize the diversity of Hepatozoon spp. in domestic dogs from Oklahoma, blood samples collected from dogs residing in an endemic area of the state, clinical cases presented to veterinarians with symptoms of ACH, and dogs housed at a local shelter were evaluated by a nested PCR designed to amplify a variable region of the 18S rRNA gene of blood ampicomplexa, including Hepatozoon spp. Hepatozoon sequences recovered from a dog from an area where ACH is endemic, from clinically ill dogs, and from one shelter dog most closely resembled H. americanum. However, two other shelter dogs had evidence of infection with H. canis or a closely related organism. A subsequent review of real-time PCR results from the Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory at Auburn University revealed that the majority of samples submitted from dogs from across the United States which tested positive for Hepatozoon spp. had H. americanum. However, some submissions were also found which contained DNA sequence of H. canis. Mixed H. americanum and H. canis-like infections also were detected. Our data suggest that H. americanum, H. canis, as well as H. canis-like organisms are present and may cause disease in dogs in the southern U.S. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence of L infantum DNA parasites by real-time quantitative PCR in our canine blood bank. METHODS: Samples from blood products obtained from 92 canine blood donors were assayed for L infantum by means of real-time PCR amplification and quantification. RESULTS: The prevalence of quantitative PCR-positive blood samples among healthy seronegative blood donors was 19.6 per cent. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The results of this study show that L infantum infection is common in canine blood donors and their blood products in an endemic area, despite a negative commercial serological screening for infectious diseases. Therefore, screening by PCR should be included in an integrated approach to evaluate L infantum infection among potential blood donors.Â© 2008 British Small Animal Veterinary Association.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:46;10.1111/j.1748-5827.2008.00542.x;;;;328;;;;;;;7;Journal of Small Animal Practice;animal,animal disease,article,blood,blood bank,blood donor,disease transmission,dog,dog disease,female,isolation and purification,Leishmania infantum,male,parasitology,polymerase chain reaction,prevalence,standard,visceral leishmaniasis,Animals,Blood Banks,Blood Donors,Dog Diseases,Dogs,Female,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Male,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Prevalence;;Cited By :21,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;325;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-54549122493&doi=10.1111%2fj.1748-5827.2008.00542.x&partnerID=40&md5=d93e0e332abb752bdaf1899ef16d7c4b;49;2008;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

PortÃºs;Asymptomatic infection by Leishmania infantum in blood donors from the Balearic Islands (Spain);BACKGROUND: Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum is a zoonotic disease endemic throughout the Mediterranean basin. The existence of asymptomatic human infection entails the risk of transmission by blood transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The prevalence of Leishmania infection was studied in 1437 blood donors from the Balearic Islands (Majorca, Formentera, and Minorca) using immunologic (Western blot [WB] and delayed-type hypersensitivity [DTH]), parasitologic (culture), and molecular (nested polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) methods. In addition, the efficiency of leuko-reduction by filtration to remove the parasite was tested by nested PCR in the red blood cell (RBC) units. RESULTS: Leishmania antibodies were detected in 44 of the 1437 blood donors tested (3.1%). A sample of 304 donors from Majorca was selected at random. L. infantum DNA was amplified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) in 18 of the 304 (5.9%), and cultures were positive in 2 of the 304 (0.6%). DTH was performed on 73 of the 304 donors and was positive for 8 of them (11%). Of the 18 donors with positive L. infantum nested PCR, only 2 were seropositive. All the RBC samples tested (13 of 18) from donors with a positive PBMNC nested PCR yielded negative nested PCR results after leukodepletion. CONCLUSIONS: Cryptic Leishmania infection is highly prevalent in blood donors from the Balearic Islands. DTH and L. infantum nested PCR appear to be more sensitive to detect asymptomatic infection than the serology. The use of leukodepletion filters appears to remove parasites from RBC units efficiently.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:46;10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01708.x;;;;1389;;;;;;;7;Transfusion;protozoal DNA,protozoon antibody,antibody detection,article,blood donor,clinical article,controlled study,delayed hypersensitivity,erythrocyte,human,human cell,Leishmania infantum,leishmaniasis,leukocyte,parasite cultivation,parasitemia,peripheral blood mononuclear cell,polymerase chain reaction,prevalence,Spain,Western blotting,animal,blood,cytology,genetics,isolation and purification,parasitology,Spain,virology,visceral leishmaniasis,Animals,Blood Donors,Erythrocytes,Humans,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Polymerase Chain Reaction,Prevalence,Spain;;Cited By :54,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;1383;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Article;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-49449118260&doi=10.1111%2fj.1537-2995.2008.01708.x&partnerID=40&md5=1ac50e7edba1852ef00ed1f66d3b38aa;48;2008;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

Britto;Detection of natural infection in Lutzomyia cruzi and Lutzomyia forattinii (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) by Leishmania infantum chagasi in an endemic area of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil using a PCR multiplex assay;In order to identify Lutzomyia spp. naturally infected by Leishmania parasites a PCR multiplex assay coupled to non-isotopic hybridization was used for the analysis of insect samples collected by CDC light traps in an endemic area of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the municipality of CorumbÃ¡, Mato Grosso do Sul State, Brazil in May/June 2006. Wild sand flies were identified and grouped into pools of 10 female specimens and 27 groups in total were collected. Positive results were obtained from Lutzomyia cruzi (2 out of 13 pools) and Lutzomyia forattinii (1 out of 14 pools). The positive pools were confirmed as being infected by Leishmania infantum chagasi after hybridizing the PCR products with a species-specific biotinylated probe derived from the kinetoplast minicircle conserved sequence. Given that we detected infection in 3 out of 27 groups and that there was at least 1 infected insect in each, it was possible to infer an infection rate of 1.5% for Lu. cruzi and 0.7% for Lu. forattinii in the analyzed samples. These results confirm the vectorial role of Lu. cruzi in transmitting L. infantum chagasi and suggest Lu. forattinii as a potential VL vector in the municipality of CorumbÃ¡, where notifications of the disease in humans and dogs have increased over the last two decades.

Babba, E. Chaker;Isoenzymatic variability of Leishmania infantum in Tunisia concerning 254 human strains;"The different clinical forms of leishmaniasis are the result of both the immunological status of individuals and the species of the parasite causing the infection. In Mediterranean countries, the Leishmania infantum complex groups zymodemes which are responsible for visceral, cutaneous and exceptionally cutaneomucosal or mucosal leishmaniasis. We report in this study a synthesis concerning 254 cases of L. infantum that have been characterized at the ""Laboratoire de Parasitologie"" of the Rabta Hospital. The strains were isolated from human cases of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) by culture on NNN medium: 156 VL cases and 98 CL cases. The isoenzymatic characterization revealed three zymodemes of L. infantum.â€¢L. infantum MON 1, a common zymodeme of VL, occurred in 154 cases (61%): 147 VL (95%) and 7 CL (5%). All CL cases were from the northern provinces, six of them occurring during an epidemic disease in 2001.â€¢L. infantum MON 24, a common zymodeme of CL in the north, occurred in 98 cases (38.5%): 91 CL (93%) and 7 VL (7%). The seven VL cases were immunocompetent children aged from 8 months to 9 years and native of northern Tunisia. Two of the CL cases were from central regions of the country. This is the first time that cases from these regions are reported.â€¢L. infantum MON 80, an uncommon zymodeme in Tunisia, occurred in two VL cases (0.5%): two children aged 7 and 5. The small number of strains of this zymodeme does not allow understanding of its epidemiological role. The results of this study indicate a low enzymatic variability of L. infantum in the country. However, our study includes only human strains and should be extended to animal ones (dogs, rodents and sand flies). This would lead to a better understanding of the epidemiology of leishmaniasis in Tunisia. Â© 2008 Elsevier B.V.

O'Dwyer;Molecular and parasitological survey of Hepatozoon canis (Apicomplexa: Hepatozoidae) in dogs from rural area of Sao Paulo state, Brazil;Hepatozoon canis is a protozoan that infects dogs and is transmitted by the ingestion of the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Two distinct species of Hepatozoon genus can infect dogs, H. canis and H. americanum. Routine tests to detect the disease are based on direct examination of gametocytes on Giemsa-stained blood smears. The objectives of this study were the investigation of infection prevalence in rural area dogs, the comparison of diagnostics by blood smear examination and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the association of infection with tick infestation. Blood smears, collected by puncture of the cephalic vein and ear margin capillary bed from 150 dogs, were examined. This technique detected 17 positive animals (11.3%), with 14 (9.3%) in peripheral blood and seven (4.7%) in cephalic vein blood. PCR tests detected 80 (53.3%) positive animals. R. sanguineus and Amblyomma spp. were found in 36 of the dogs (24%), in equal proportions. The identified species for Amblyomma genus were A. cajennense and A. ovale. Data analysis showed that PCR was much more sensitive when compared to blood smear examination. Hepatozoon species was previously identified as closely related to H. canis.

Henderson, W. Sylvester;Prevalence of Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma platys, Babesia canis vogeli, Hepatozoon canis, Bartonella vinsonii berkhoffii, and Rickettsia spp. in dogs from Grenada;"To identify the tick-borne pathogens in dogs from Grenada, we conducted a serologic survey for Ehrlichia canis in 2004 (104 dogs) and a comprehensive serologic and molecular survey for a variety of tick-borne pathogens in 2006 (73 dogs). In 2004 and 2006, 44 and 32 dogs (42.3% and 43.8%) were seropositive for E. canis, respectively. In 2006, several tick-borne pathogens were identified by serology and PCR. DNA of E. canis, Anaplasma platys, Babesia canis vogeli, Hepatozoon canis, and Bartonella sp. were identified in 18 (24.7%), 14 (19.2%), 5 (7%), 5 (7%), and 1 (1.4%) dogs, respectively. Six (8.2%) dogs were seropositive for Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii. All dogs were seronegative and PCR-negative for Rickettsia spp. Coinfection with two or three pathogens was observed in eight dogs. Partial 16S rRNA E. canis and A. platys sequences were identical to sequences in GenBank. Partial 18S rRNA gene sequences from the Grenadian H. canis were identical to each other and had one possible mismatch (ambiguous base) from H. canis detected from Spain and Brazil. Grenadian B. c. vogeli sequences were identical to B. c. vogeli from Brazil and Japan. All of the detected pathogens are transmitted, or suspected to be transmitted, by Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Results of this study indicate that dogs from Grenada are infected with multiple tick-borne pathogens; therefore, tick-borne diseases should be included as differentials for dogs exhibiting thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, fever, or lethargy. One pathogen, E. canis, is also of potential public health significance. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Roura;Vector-borne infections in cats: Molecular study in Barcelona area (Spain);Previous serological surveys have reported the presence of different organisms in cats from Spain but little reports exist about the exact identity of these organisms. The purpose of the study reported here was to assess the presence of DNA of several vector-borne infections in a population of cats from Barcelona area. One hundred blood samples obtained from cats admitted to the UAB-VTH were entered into the study and classified as healthy (n = 48) or unhealthy (n = 52). EDTA-blood samples were assayed for Leishmania infantum, Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia spp., Bartonella spp., Hepatozoon spp., Babesia spp. and Theileria spp. DNA by means of PCR amplification and amplicons obtained were sequenced. Prevalence of infectious agents found were Leishmania infantum (3%), Ehrlichia/Anaplasma sp. (1%), Hepatozoon felis (4%) and Bartonella clarridgeiae (1%). Cats being less than 5 years old had more probability of having at less one PCR positive result (P = 0.028). The results of this study show a low prevalence of several vector-borne pathogens among cats from Barcelona area. Although higher feline seroprevalences are previously reported, they evidenced exposure and probably overestimate the real or active degree of infection. However, it is important to maintain a high index of suspicion on these infectious diseases, both in sick and asymptomatic cats, and molecular techniques could aid in the identification of these pathogens.

The objective of this study was to use dogs as sentinels for multiple vector-borne organisms in order to evaluate the potential for human infection with these agents in southeastern Brazil. Blood from 198 sick dogs with clinicopathological abnormalities consistent with tick-borne infections were selected at the SÃ£o Paulo State University Veterinary Teaching Hospital in Botucatu and tested for DNA and/or antibodies against specific vector-borne pathogens. At least one organism was detected in 88% of the dogs, and Ehrlichia canis DNA was amplified from 78% of the blood samples. Bartonella spp. seroreactivity was found in 3.6%. Leishmania chagasi antibodies were detected in 1% of the dogs. There was no serological or polymerase chain reaction evidence of infection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia ewingii, and Rickettsia rickettsii. The full E. canis 16S rRNA gene sequence of one of the Brazilian strains obtained in this study was identical to the causative agent of human ehrlichiosis in Venezuela. Ehrlichia canis may pose a human health hazard and may be undiagnosed in southeastern Brazil, whereas exposure to the other organisms examined in this study is presumably infrequent.

Gennari, J.P. Dubey, R.R. Tidwell, D.S. Lindsay;Serological survey of Leishmania infantum and Trypanosoma cruzi in dogs from urban areas of Brazil and Colombia;Leishmania infantum and Trypanosoma cruzi are zoonotic parasites that are endemic throughout many parts of Latin America. Infected dogs play an important role in transmission of both parasites to humans. A serological survey of Leishmania and Trypanosoma infection was conducted on 365 dogs from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and BogatÃ¡, Colombia, South America. Serum samples were examined by the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). Anti-Leishmania IgG antibodies were detected in 5 of 107 from Brazil (4.7%) and in 4 of 258 dogs (1.6%) from Colombia. Titers ranged from 1:25 to 1:100. Anti-T. cruzi antibodies were not detected in any of the dogs from either Brazil or Colombia. The results show a low prevalence of anti-Leishmania antibodies and no antibodies against T. cruzi in these canine populations. Our study suggests that dogs play a limited role in the spread of L. infantum and T. cruzi in these urban areas of Brazil and Colombia. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Bern;Kala-Azar outbreak in Libo Kemkem, Ethiopia: Epidemiologic and parasitologic assessment;"In May 2005, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was recognized for the first time in Libo Kemkem, Ethiopia. In October 2005, a rapid assessment was conducted using data from 492 patients with VL treated in the district health center and a household survey of 584 residents of four villages. One subdistrict accounted for 71% of early cases, but the incidence and number of affected subdistricts increased progressively throughout 2004-2005. In household-based data, we identified 9 treated VL cases, 12 current untreated cases, and 19 deaths attributable to VL (cumulative incidence, 7%). Thirty percent of participants were leishmanin skin test positive (men, 34%; women, 26%; P = 0.06). VL was more common in men than women (9.7% versus 4.5%, P < 0.05), possibly reflecting male outdoor sleeping habits. Molecular typing in splenic aspirates showed L. infantum (six) and L. donovani (one). Local transmission resulted from multiple introductions, is now well established, and will be difficult to eradicate.

Munstermann, L. Bell-Sakyi, F. Jongejan;Longitudinal monitoring of Ehrlichia ruminantium infection in Gambian lambs and kids by pCS20 PCR and MAP1-B ELISA;"Background: The epidemiology of E. ruminantium infection in extensively managed young animals is not adequately understood. Thus in this study, we monitored the onset (age at first infection) and kinetics of E. ruminantium infection and antibody response in extensively managed newborn lambs and kids at three sites in The Gambia. Methods: We used a nested pCS20 PCR and MAP1-B ELISA in a longitudinal study to monitor the onset (age at first infection) and kinetics of E. ruminantium infection and antibody response respectively, in 77 newborn lambs and kids under a traditional husbandry system at three sites (Kerr Seringe, Keneba, Bansang) in The Gambia where heartwater is known to occur. The animals were monitored for field tick infestation and the comparative performance of the two assays in detecting E. ruminantium infection was also assessed. Results: The infection rate detected by pCS20 PCR varied between 8.6% and 54.8% over the 162-day study period. Nineteen per cent of the animals in week 1 post-partum tested positive by pCS20 PCR with half of these infections (7/14) detected in the first 3 days after birth, suggesting that transmission other than by tick feeding had played a role. The earliest detectable A. variegatum infestation in the animals occurred in week 16 after birth. Antibodies detected by MAP1-B ELISA also varied, between 11.5% and 90%. Although there is considerable evidence that this assay can detect false positives and due to this and other reasons serology is not a reliable predictor of infection at least for heartwater. In contrast to the pCS20 PCR, the serological assay detected the highest proportion of positive animals in week 1 with a gradual decline in seropositivity with increasing age. The pCS20 PCR detected higher E. ruminantium prevalence in the animals with increasing age and both the Spearman's rank test (rs = -0.1512; P = 0.003) and kappa statistic (-0.091 to 0.223) showed a low degree of agreement between the two assays. Conclusion: The use of pCS20 PCR supported by transmission studies and clinical data could provide more accurate information on heartwater epidemiology in endemic areas and single-occasion testing of an animal may not reveal its true infection status. The view is supported because both the vector and vertical transmission may play a vital role in the epidemiology of heartwater in young small ruminants; the age range of 4 and 12 weeks corresponds to the period of increased susceptibility to heartwater in traditionally managed small ruminants.

The presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies was detected by immunofluorescence antibodies test (cut off 1:100). The overall seroprevalence found in the 1,803 dogs studied was 7.8% (141 positive dogs). Seropositivity was not associated with either breed or sex. Statistical analysis revealed greater seroprevalence in groups of older dogs, indicating that the probability of exposure to the bite of sand flies infected with Leishmania infantum increased with age. The most important result was a high proportion of seropositivity for leishmaniosis (79.5%) among dogs without clinical signs of canine leishmaniosis. These data are very important because stray dogs can play an important role in the epidemiology of this zoonotic disease. Furthermore, the stray population could be useful sentinels to follow the progress of the disease in endemic areas.

Soteriadou;First detection and genetic typing of Leishmania infantum MON-24 in a dog from the Moroccan Mediterranean coast: Genetic diversity of MON-24;As in the countries edging the Mediterranean basin, Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON-1 is the main causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis in Morocco, where visceral leishmaniasis is most active in the North-Eastern slopes of the Rif mountains. The dog was confirmed to be the main reservoir of L. infantum MON-1, while the reservoir of L. infantum MON-24 causative agent of both infantile visceral leishmaniasis and cutaneous leishmaniasis has not yet been identified. Here we report the first detection of this last zymodeme in a dog in Morocco. The isolated strain was first identified by the use of genotyping markers and confirmed by isoenzyme analysis. Phylogenetic analysis with the use of concatenated sequences from 26 Leishmania donovani complex strains revealed strong geographical correlation with the MON-24 strain from Morocco clustering with other East African strains whereas two other MON-24 strains clustered with L. infantum strains. Interestingly, the two distinct populations of MON-24 identified with the use of genotyping markers cannot be distinguished by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Â© 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Teixeira;Exposure to mixed asymptomatic infections with Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania braziliensis and Leishmania chagasi in the human population of the greater Amazon;Lack of conservation of the Amazon tropical rainforest has imposed severe threats to its human population living in newly settled villages, resulting in outbreaks of some infectious diseases. We conducted a seroepidemiological survey of 1100 inhabitants of 15 villages of PaÃ§o do Lumiar County, Brazil. Thirty-five (3%) individuals had been exposed to Trypanosoma cruzi (Tc), 41 (4%) to Leishmania braziliensis (Lb) and 50 (4.5%) to Leishmania chagasi (Lc) infections. Also, 35 cases had antibodies that were cross-reactive against the heterologous kinetoplastid antigens. Amongst these, the Western blot assays revealed that 11 (1%) had Tc and Lb, that seven (0.6%) had Lc and Tc, and that 17 (1.6%) had Lb and Lc infections. All of these cases of exposures to mixed infections with Leishmania sp, and eight of 11 cases of Tc and Lb were confirmed by specific PCR assays and Southern hybridizations. Two cases had triple infections. We consider these asymptomatic cases showing phenotype and genotype markers consistent with mixed infections by two or more kinetoplastid flagellates a high risk factor for association with Psychodidae and Triatominae vectors blood feeding and transmitting these protozoa infections. This is the first publication showing human exposure to mixed asymptomatic kinetoplastid infections in the Amazon.

Morillas-MÃ¡rquez;Infection by Leishmania infantum in cats: Epidemiological study in Spain;More than 40 cases of feline leishmaniasis have been reported in the scientific literature. The influence of some immunodepressive conditions of viral origin, such as leukemia and feline immunodeficiency, are still unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of Leishmania infection in cats and possible relations with these viral infections. Markers of Leishmania infection were searched in 183 cats from Southern Spain by IFAT, PCR, Giemsa stain and culture, with a follow-up of positive cats. Seropositivity was 60.0% (Ab titer â‰¥10) and 28.3% of animals presented Ab titers â‰¥40. Around 25.7% of the cats studied were parasitemic and some of them remained positive for months. Combining both data, 70.6% of the feline population was, or could be, infected. We observed a negative association between seropositivity to Leishmania and infection by FeLV. Hence, production of antibodies against the parasite appears to be compromised in cats with leukemia, which have a prevalence of 36% in our study. In contrast, we found no association with feline immunodeficiency. The results makes us doubt the value of conventional serological methods to detect active Leishmania infection in cats.

ELISA results were further confirmed in 69 cats by Western blot (WB). Finally, 76 of them were also tested for FeLV and FIV. Seroprevalence by ELISA-prot A was 6.29%, and that by ELISA-IgG was 5.25%. Positive cat sera recognized patterns of polypeptides in WB, including L. infantum-specific antigenic fractions. There was no association with retroviruses. Leishmania-specific antibodies are prevalent in cats living in ecoregions around the Northwestern Mediterranean basin; thus, leishmaniasis must be included in the differential diagnosis of diseases in cats living in these ecoregions. Their role as peridomestic reservoirs for L. infantum needs further characterization, but it could be hypothesized that the cat is a secondary reservoir host, rather than an accidental one.

H. canis infections caused simultaneously by two different isolates were confirmed by RFLP analysis in samples from all the geographic regions studied. In Venezuela, blood samples from 134 dogs were surveyed. Babesia infections were found in 2.24% of the dogs. Comparison of sequences of the 18S rRNA gene indicated that protozoan isolates were genetically identical to B. canis vogeli from Japan and Brazil. H. canis infected 44.77% of the dogs. A representative sample of Venezuelan H. canis isolates (21.6% of PCR-positives) was sequenced. Many of them showed 18S rRNA gene sequences identical to H. canis Spain 2, albeit two less frequent genotypes were found in the sample studied. In Thailand, 20 dogs were analyzed. No infections caused by Babesia were diagnosed, whereas 30% of the dogs were positive to hematozoan infection. Two protozoa isolates showing 99.7-100% identity to H. canis Spain 2 were found. In Spain, 250 dogs were studied. B. canis vogeli infected 0.01% of the animals. The sequence of the 18S rRNA gene in Spanish isolates of this protozoa was closely related to those previously deposited in GenBankÂ® (&gt;99% identity). Finally, 20 red foxes were screened for hematozoans employing semi-nested PCR and primers designed to detect Babesia/Theileria. Fifty percent of the foxes were positive to Theileria annae. In addition, it was found that the PCR assay was able as well to detect Hepatozoon infections.

Sengul, S.O. Toz;Investigation of asymptomatic visceral leishmaniasis cases using western blot in an endemic area in Turkey;In Turkey, Leishmania infantum is responsible for human visceral leishmaniasis (VL), which is seen mainly in the Aegean, Mediterranean, and Central Anatolia Regions. This study aimed to determine asymptomatic infections in an endemic area of VL in Turkey using the western blot technique. A total of 82 persons including children and adults were chosen randomly in Denizli province which is one of the endemic sites for VL. Serum samples were collected and screened using indirect immunofluorescent test (IFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot (WB). One year later, 35 of the 82 persons were sampled and screened serologically for the second time. Seven out of 82 samples were found to be positive by western blot analysis with the presence of 14 and/or 18 kDa bands. Two of these seven sera were also positive by IFAT, but only one of these two was positive by ELISA. Only one person showing seropositivity with all three tests had clinical symptoms and was diagnosed as VL with the presence of amastigotes in bone marrow aspirate. Because six people, including the one found to be seropositive in all two tests, had no clinical symptoms, they were accepted as asymptomatic carriers. The ratio of asymptomatic infection was calculated as 7.41% (6/81) in the region. In the second sampling, the western blot revealed antibodies against the same antigens in all seven subjects. Our findings showed that the presence of antibodies against 14 and 18 kDa antigens are important for the diagnosis of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Western blot was found to be effective in the detection of asymptomatic persons in the epidemiological studies in endemic areas.;;;;;;;Scopus;;;;2018-03-09 18:46;;;;;18;;;;;;;1;New Microbiologica;Asymptomatic,Diagnosis,Leishmaniasis,Turkey,Western blot,parasite antigen,protozoon antibody,adolescent,adult,aged,animal,blood,child,endemic disease,enzyme linked immunosorbent assay,evaluation,female,fluorescent antibody technique,human,immunology,infant,isolation and purification,Leishmania infantum,male,methodology,middle aged,newborn,parasitology,pathophysiology,preschool child,review,Turkey (republic),visceral leishmaniasis,Western blotting,Adolescent,Adult,Aged,Animals,Antibodies, Protozoan,Antigens, Protozoan,Blotting, Western,Child,Child, Preschool,Endemic Diseases,Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay,Female,Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect,Humans,Infant,Infant, Newborn,Leishmania infantum,Leishmaniasis, Visceral,Male,Middle Aged,Turkey,Leishmania infantum;;Cited By :13,Export Date: 8 March 2018;;;13;;;;;;;;;;;JOUR;Review;;https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33847302032&partnerID=40&md5=9c3eddd80494cf61cfb8df0c7f12a9b0;30;2007;Paul.Gale;3;Leishmania infantum

In 2002, 530 (35%) of 1,532 had positive LST results; the prevalence increased with increasing age. The LST result was positive in 24 (51%) of 47, 18 (72%) of 25, and 11 (85%) of 13 kala-azar patients treated in the previous 1-11, 12-23, and 24-35 months. A positive LST result in 2002 was associated with protection against subsequent kala-azar (P < 0.0001). In 2003-2004, decreased antigen sensitivity was observed. Among 686 participants, 34% were LST-positive in 2002, 29% in 2003, and 19% in 2004. Of 63 cured kala-azar patients, 70% were positive in 2002, 53% in 2003, and only 30% in 2004. Among 171 participants tested with both antigens, L. infantum study antigen sensitivity was 70% compared with L. amazonensis antigen. Our data underscore the need for better production, standardization, and documentation of sensitivity, potency, and stability of leishmanin antigens.

Schaefer, R.W. Stich;Detection of Hepatozoon canis in stray dogs and cats in Bangkok, Thailand;A rapidly increasing stray animal population in Bangkok has caused concern regarding transmission of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine if stray animals in Bangkok are a potential reservoir of Hepatozoon, a genus of tick-borne parasites that has received little attention in Thailand. Blood samples were collected from stray companion animals near monasteries in 42 Bangkok metropolitan districts. Both dogs and cats were sampled from 26 districts, dogs alone from 4 districts and cats alone from 12 districts. Samples were collected from a total of 308 dogs and 300 cats. Light microscopy and an 18 S rRNA gene-based PCR assay were used to test these samples for evidence of Hepatozoon infection. Gamonts were observed in blood smears for 2.6% of dogs and 0.7% of cats by microscopy. The PCR assay detected Hepatozoon in buffy coats from 11.4% of dogs and 32.3% of cats tested. The prevalence of infection was the same between male and female dogs or cats, and PCR-positive dogs and cats were found in 36.6% and 36.8% of the districts surveyed, respectively. There was an association between the percentages of PCR-positive dogs and cats in districts where both host species were sampled. Sequences of representative amplicons were closest to those reported for H. canis. These results represent the first molecular confirmation that H. canis is indigenous to Thailand. The unexpectedly high prevalence of Hepatozoon among stray cats indicates that their role in the epizootiology of hepatozoonosis should be investigated.

Bor;Sero-epidemological survey on canine visceral leishmaniasis and the distribution of sandfly vectors in Northwestern Turkey: Prevention strategies for childhood visceral leishmaniasis;Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum, is an endemic disease in Aegean and Mediterranean Regions among humans and dogs. In this study, a sero-epidemiological survey for VL and cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), which both are sporadically reported in the region, were carried out in the villages of Eskisehir, Afyon, and Bilecik cities. The study was designed according to the location of the sporadic cases of VL and CL, and blood samples of 111 dogs were randomly collected. Lymph node aspiration samples were taken from dogs that have popliteal lymphadenopathy. Sand flies were also collected using CDC light traps in the several localities. The sera samples were screened using IFAT, ELISA, rk39 ELISA and dip-stick tests for anti- Leishmania antibodies. A total of 15 (13.51 per cent) dogs out of 111 were found to be seropositive by at least one of the tests. The seropositivity ratios among dogs were found to be 27.5 per cent (8/29), 9.09 per cent (4/44) and 7.8 per cent (3/38) in Afyon, Bilecik and Eskisehir cities respectively. Leishmania amastigotes were detected in 4 of the 14 lymph node aspiration samples (eight seronegative, six seropositive), and all of them were seropositive dogs. One year later, two of the dogs were found to be dead and the other two were severely ill. Among the 179 collected Phlebotomus specimens from, Phlebotomus major was found to be abundant (35.7 per cent) and the other species were P. simici (28.5 per cent), P. similis (34.7 per cent) and P. alexandri (1.1 per cent). In the study area, canine VL is more spread than human VL. Because dogs are playing an important role for VL in Mediterranean Basin, and development of appropriate control measures will be necessary for childhood VL.

Franke;Domestic swine in a visceral leishmaniasis endemic area produce antibodies against multiple Leishmania infantum antigens but apparently resist to L. infantum infection;In order to investigate whether pigs can be infected by Leishmania infantum, a serological and parasitological study was carried out on swine in the JequiÃ© municipality, Northeast of Brazil. Anti-Leishmania infantum antibodies were detected in 37 out of 92 swine (40.2%), by two different assays: an anti-L. infantum lysate and an anti-K39 recombinant protein ELISA. An experimental study was also carried out to verify the susceptibility of domestic pigs to L. infantum infection. Three sows inoculated with 108 stationary-phase infective L. infantum promastigotes (26% metacyclic promastigotes) per kilogram of body weight produced anti-Leishmania antibodies until the end of the experiment, 11 months later. No parasites, however, could be visualized through optical microscopy of spleen, liver and bone marrow or by in vitro culture of these organs. Homogenates of these organs were also inoculated in hamsters, without producing infection. No Leishmania DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in sand flies fed on these animals. The results indicate that domestic pigs bitten by L. infantum-infected vectors in the endemic area do not display a full infection pattern, and the positive association in endemic areas between the presence of swine and infection in canines may not be ascribable to the former acting as a parasite reservoir.

Breitschwerdt;A serological study of exposure to arthropod-borne pathogens in dogs from northeastern Spain;"There is limited information regarding the prevalence of many vector borne pathogens in Europe and especially in Spanish dogs. We investigated 206 sick and 260 clinically healthy dogs from three different regions in northeastern Spain for antibodies to Rickettsia conorii (Rc), Ehrlichia canis (Ec), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap), Bartonella henselae (Bh), Bartonella vinsonii subsp. berkhoffii (Bvb), Leishmania infantum (Li) and Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb) and for antigen of Dirofilaria immitis (Di). Total prevalences were the following: Rc (56.4%), Li (30%), Ec (16.7%), Bh (16.8%), Ap (11.5%), Bvb (1.07%), Di (0.6%) and Bb (0.6%). Seroprevalences for Rc, Ec, Ap, Bh, and Bvb and Bb and Di antigens were similar among the three different study sites. The Ec seroprevalence, as determined by Snap 3DX, was statistically lower in dogs from Mallorca (0%) than Tarragona (16%) and Barcelona (5%) (P < 0.0001). Detection of Rc antibodies was associated with seroreactivity to Ec and Ap antigens (P = 0.018 and P = 0.002, respectively). IFA Ec antibodies were associated with Ap seroreactivity (P < 0.0001). There was no association between the clinical status, sex, time of the year when samples were collected, life-style or exposure to fleas or ticks and a positive test result for Ec, Bh, Bvb, or Bb antibodies or Di antigens. Li seroreactivity was associated with illness and living outdoors (P < 0.0001, P = 0.029; respectively), Rc seroreactivity with the male gender (P = 0.028) and Ap seroreactivity with living outdoors (P = 0.045). This study indicates that exposure to Rc, Li, Ec or related Ehrlichia spp., Bh and Ap or a related spp., is common whereas Di, Bb and Bvb is uncommon among dogs from the Mediterranean basin. We also provide serological data that suggests the existence of a novel Ehrlichia species on Mallorca island.

Motazedian, S. Rafizadeh, M.R. Yaghoobi Ershadi, M. Mohebali;Phlebotomus (Paraphlebotomus) alexandri: A probable vector of Leishmania infantum in Iran;The incidence of human visceral leishmaniasis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum, which is endemic in several parts of Iran, has recently increased in the Nourabad-Mamassani district of Fars province, in the south of the country. Between 2003 and 2005, 12,688 sandflies were caught in this focus, using CDC miniature light traps, sticky traps and aspirators, in an attempt to identify the main vector of L. infantum. When 120 of the parous, female Phlebotomus (Paraphlebotomus) alexandri caught were individually checked for Leishmania infection, in an assay based on PCR and kinetoplast minicircle primers (LINR4 and LIN17), five (4.2%) of the flies were found to be infected with L. infantum. Thirty-nine (32.5%) of the 120 blood-fed Ph. alexandri checked in an ELISA were found positive for human blood. Since Ph. alexandri-was the third-most common species caught (representing over 17% of the total catch), was clearly anthropophilic, and was not infrequently infected with L. infantum, it is probably an important vector in the Nourabad-Mamassani focus. Although other sandfly species have been found naturally infected with promastigotes in Iran, Ph. alexandri is the first that has been proven to harbour L. infantum in the country.

Eren;A parasitological, molecular and serological survey of Hepatozoon canis infection in dogs around the Aegean coast of Turkey;Canine hepatozoonosis is caused by the tick-borne protozoon Hepatozoon spp. The prevalence of the infection in the Aegean coast of Turkey was investigated by examination of blood smear parasitology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using blood samples from 349 dogs collected from Central Aydin, Kusadasi, Selcuk, Central Manisa, Bodrum and Marmaris within the Aegean coast of Turkey. The indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for the detection of Hepatozoon canis antibodies was also used to detect the exposure rate to H. canis. PCR amplifying a 666 bp fragment of 18S rRNA gene of Hepatozoon spp. was used in the epidemiological survey. The prevalence of Hepatozoon spp. infection was 10.6% by blood smear parasitology and 25.8% by PCR. IFAT revealed that 36.8% of serum samples were positive for antibodies reactive with Hepatozoon spp. The PCR products of 18S rRNA gene of Hepatozoon spp. isolated from six infected dogs, one isolate originating from each of the six different locations, were sequenced. The results of sequence analysis indicate that they are closely related to Indian and Japanese isolates of H. canis. This is the first epidemiological study on the prevalence of H. canis infection in the dog, in Turkey. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Blood samples of 36 household crossbred dogs from Sergio Tamer village and 43 dogs from Quinta village were collected and the serum used for serological diagnosis. An Indirect Fluorescent Antibody Test (IFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to detect antibodies against Leishmania. The clinical examination showed that 25% of the canine population of Quinta presented a poor body condition and in 39%, ectoparasites (ticks and fleas) were detected. In both tests, serology revealed that 21% (9 out of 43) of the dogs presented antibodies against Leishmania (55% were asymptomatic and 45% were symptomatic). In the Vila SÃ©rgio Tamer, 25% (9 out of 36) of the dogs were seropositive for Leishmania (66.67% were asymptomatic and 33.33% were symptomatic), 33% presented poor body condition, and 22% have ectoparasites. The clinical signs more frequent were skin lesions. The statistical analysis showed that there was no statistical difference (p > 0.05) between the seropositivity of the dogs from the two villages. The same was observed when the clinical signs were compared (p > 0.05). Both villages have favorable conditions to maintain the cycle of leishmaniasis. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The city is situated in the northern part of the Brazilian State of Minas Gerais and is an endemic area of AVL. Systematic phlebotomine captures were performed in seven districts with previously reported cases of canine visceral leishmaniasis, during 2 years (January 2000-December 2001). A total of 2328 specimens of L. longipalpis were captured. The association between the local climate variables and the population density of L. longipalpis was evaluated and rainfall was determined to be a major factor, with increased populations during the rainy season (October-March). At the same time period, blood samples from every dog domiciled in the same seven districts, in total 14,077 animals, were analyzed for infection by viscerotropic Leishmania using indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Accumulated incidence rates of canine VL per district varied from 3.40 to 14.34 for the 2-year period. A positive correlation between the population density of L. longipalpis and the canine cases of visceral leishmaniasis in Porteirinha was observed. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Survey included 68 dogs living in the coastal city of Split, and 238 dogs living in 12 villages scattered in the hinterland. Each dog was clinically examined for the presence of some discrete signs compatible with leishmaniosis and by dot-ELISA modification determined the presence of anti-Leishmania antibodies. The titre 1:600 and higher was regarded as positive in the study. The seroprevalence ranged from 0 to 42.85%, depending on the location. 54.34% of the seropositive dogs had moderately enlarged lymph nodes and/or some discrete changes on the skin. In our parasitological study, Leishmania sp. was isolated from several seropositive animals that had some clinical signs and from a few which did not have any. Data analysis revealed that serological positivity to Leishmania sp. was not associated with a dog's outdoor lifestyle and utility, but was associated with the gender and age. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Anti-leishmanial antibodies were detected by the direct agglutination test (DAT). Parasitological study was performed for all captured wild canines and were detected in some of the seropositive dogs with specific clinical signs (n = 107). Serum samples (n = 1568) were collected from domestic dogs in villages that are known endemic foci of human visceral leishmaniosis (HVL). Wild canine sera were collected from jackals (Canis aureus, n = 10), foxes (Vulpes vulpes, n = 10) and wolves (Canis lupus, n = 10). Of the 1568 serum sampled collected from domestic dogs, 222 (14.2%) were positive by DAT (1:320 and above). No statistically significant difference was found between male (15.2%) and female (11.8%) sero-prevalence (P = 0.083). Dogs of 8 years and above showed the highest sero-prevalence (40.6%). Only 23.9% of the seropositive domestic dogs had clinical signs. Parasitology and serology tests that were performed in 30 wild canines showed 10% these animals were infected by Leishmania infantum. Ten out of 11 Leishmania spp. isolated from the dogs and wild canines were identified as L. infantum and one other as L. tropica by molecular and biochemical techniques. For the first time in Iran, L. infantum and L. tropica were isolated from viscera of both a wolf and a domestic dog. Â© 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The incidence of the disease from February 1998 to February 2002 was recorded and two cross-sectional surveys using the leishmanin skin test (LST) and immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) were carried out. The dipstick test with recombinant r-K39 antigen was also applied in 2002. The incidence of the disease per year among the population (n = 118) during the period of study was 0.004. The rate of new infections per year was 0.07 [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 0.15-1.09]. The overall prevalence of infection measured by LST was not significantly higher in 2002 (43.2%) than in 1998 (28.3%), but it was with IFAT [16.3% vs. 4.6%; odds ratio (OR): 4.01; 95% CI: 1.03-22.78; P = 0.022] which would indicate an increasing transmission. The dipstick test only detected infection in children up to 10 years (19.4%). Prevalence in dogs was not significantly different in 2002 (57%) vs. 1998 (33%). The parasite was isolated from dogs and identified by a polymerase chain reaction based on telomeric sequences as Leishmania chagasi/infantum.

Significant differences (p = 0.001) were found between the prevalence of MVL in symptomatic and asymptomatic human populations (12.6 and 0.5%, respectively), but a more modest difference was observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic canines (45.4 and 24.4%, respectively). From the results, it appears that Greece has a high background of canine leishmaniasis, which is likely to be a risk factor for the emergence of human MVL. Â© 2004 The British Infection Society.
